Despite undisputed evidence that they have participated in and exercised extensive control over the design and construction of several new Days Inn hotels that are inaccessible to individuals with disabilities, Days Inns of America, Inc. (\'93DIA\'94
) and HFS Incorporated (\'93HFS\'94) contend that they bear no responsibility for those hotels under title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 12181 through 12189 (\'93ADA\'94
).  According to DIA and HFS, Congress' directive to end discrimination against individuals with disabilities does not apply to them:  it is only P & P and other small businessmen like them who must comply with the ADA.
\par \tab DIA\rquote s}{\fs24\super 1{\footnote \pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\sa240\widctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\fs24 \tab }{\fs24\super 1}{\fs24 
As in the United States' Memorandum in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment (\'93U.S. Mem.\'94), defendants DIA and HFS are referred to collectively as DIA, unless the context requires otherwise.}}}{\fs24 
 argument rests on a fundamental misreading of the ADA and its legislative history.  Despite DIA's protestations to the contrary, the ADA and its legislative histo
ry do not limit compliance with new construction requirements to those who own, operate or lease a new facility.  Instead, Congress has made it illegal for }{\fs24\ul any}{\fs24 
 individual or entity to design and construct an inaccessible facility, whatever their relationsh
ip to the facility after its completion.  And, even if DIA's reading of the ADA were correct, the United States has introduced abundant, undisputed evidence showing the ways in which DIA controls and directs the functioning of the hotels in its chain, suc
h that DIA \'93operates\'94 those hotels within the meaning of title III.
\par \tab In addition to misreading the ADA, DIA advances a variety of other theories to relieve itself from responsibility for ADA violations at new Days Inn hotels.  For instance, DIA maintains th
at it has no ADA liability because it has assigned responsibility for ADA compliance to its licensees, under the terms of its license agreements.  Even if DIA's purported assignment of ADA liability were valid, however, it is well established that the dut
y to comply with a federal civil rights law cannot be delegated.  While such an assignment may give DIA an action against its licensees (}{\fs24\ul e.g.}{\fs24 
, for indemnification), it is no defense to an ADA action against DIA and HFS directly for their parts in the design and construction of the Champaign Days Inn.
\par \tab DIA also seeks to avoid liability by invoking state common law principles of agency.  The government, however, has not advanced any claim based on an agency theory, or any other theory of vicarious liability.  
To the contrary, the United States has consistently maintained that, due to its extensive participation in and control over the design and construction of all new Days Inn hotels, including the Champaign Days Inn, DIA has its own, independent responsibili
t
y to comply with the ADA.  As the Champaign Days Inn and numerous other new inaccessible Days Inns prove, DIA has consistently failed to meet that responsibility.  Thus, DIA is liable for its own violation of the ADA, not for some other person or entity's
 failure to comply with the statute.

\'94 was redefined to include public accommodations and \'93commercial facilities.\'94  Unlike \'a7 302, however, no language was added to \'a7 303 to indicate that those who own, operate or lease the facilities in question were the only parties
