We believe, however, that the implications of our inquiry extend far beyond those domains.  The tendencies we hope to elucidate find their origins in the human animal, not in any particular legal theoretic perspective.  It happens that these tendencies are especially prominent in law and economics, currently the dominant theoretical paradigm for creating and analyzing legal policy.  But the relevance of our thesis is not confined to one approach, or even to legal-political questions.  All humans are more or less implicated, whether they are liberals or conservatives, legal economists or critical theorists, students or scholars, producers or consumers, elected officials or citizens. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B6}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B6}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F6 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN6]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  When those sorts of human tendencies are taken seriously, the initial puzzle begins to lose its mystery.  The puzzle is simply an expression of the larger human inclination to see disposition where situation is largely controlling and to do so in a way that is self-affirming.  Legal economists view others as dispositionally--typically selfishly--motivated because they can plausibly infer such information from people's conduct.  And the dispositions--which legal economists typically call "preferences"--behind that conduct are thereby "revealed."  Or it at least appears that way to legal economists, given the influence of the fundamental attribution error.  Legal economists, likewise, }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber14}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber14}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 see themselves (and others in their move-ment) as dispositionally driven, but their own purposes are presumed less crass, in part because their personal sense of themselves does not "reveal" such motives, and in part because they are motivated to attribute their successes and their competitors' concomitant failures to dispositional, not situational, forces. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B32}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B32}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F32 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN32]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *139}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  It is not contradiction, then, but consistency that begins to suggest the more illuminating dimension of this puzzle.  Legal economists presume a dispositional account of behavior, both in their understanding of economic actors and institutions as selfish, and in their view of themselves as relatively selfless. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B33}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B33}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F33 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN33]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Social psych-ology, however, has demonstrated that seemingly dispositional actions are very often more accurately identified as situational reactions.

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  The point--and this is a big one--is that even though individuals and institutions may behave as if their goal were to maximize wealth, such behavior may actually reflect the social stage of interactions (the situation) more than it does the dispositions of the actors.  Moreover, legal economists have failed to take situation into account in their understanding of their own success, both individually and as a school of thought.

This intellectual revolution began modestly in the 1960s and 1970s with a few important and innovative articles and a comprehensive, masterful text that showed the possibilities of the field.  Then, in the 1980s the field exploded into respectability and prominence--becoming a regular course in the curricula of the best law schools, a vibrant legal research style that figured in a torrent of important books and articles, a force that transformed many faculty from exclusive practitioners of traditional doctrinal research to a more social-science-oriented research, and a substantial justification for important public policy changes.  By the early 1990s, economic analysis suffused a modern legal education, even one devoid of an explicit course in law and economics. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B69}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B69}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F69 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN69]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  When explaining their success, legal economists rely not just on proud descriptions of methods, discoveries, and insights, but also on the legacy of intellectual giants, from Jeremy Bentham and Adam Smith to Gary Becker and George Stigler. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B73}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B73}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F73 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN73]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The internal histories of the emergence of law and economics thus focus on the "great ideas" and "great men" }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B74}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B74}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F74 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN74]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  of the movement, as if Coase and Copernicus played analogous roles in advancing science. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B75}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B75}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F75 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN75]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Even if that is an overstatement, it is patently clear that legal economists see themselves as the rightful winners of a fair and effective process--a success that is measured largely in terms of real-world influence and without reference to the serious criticisms of their approach.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Professor Horwitz, though no doubt disappointed with the outcome, also seemed to view the rise and fall of ideas and theories as part of a fair competition, or at least that seems an obvious }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *147}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  inference to draw from his prediction about the imminent demise of law and economics. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B76}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B76}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F76 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN76]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   And Horwitz is by no means the only non-economist exhibiting such faith.  Indeed, it seems to be widespread in legal academics, as revealed by the fact that unfairness or bias }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber22}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber22}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 in the marketplace of ideas is rarely discussed among its participants--even among those scholars whose work is built on identifying and describing such unfairness and bias in other institutions. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B77}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B77}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F77 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN77]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Thus, while scholars have not always explicitly claimed that theoretical dominance implies theoretical superiority, such an inference is manifested in the legal economists' boasting and the critics' collective (and now largely frustrated) expectation that law and economics would pass quickly.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  A closer look at the details of legal theoretic discourse reveals yet another nuance to the pattern.  Legal economists attribute their success in the tournament to internal or dispositional factors.  They seem to view their methods and insights, perhaps even their intellectual capacity, as simply superior to those of their competitors.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  That dispositional perspective is amplified when economists criticize their competitors.  Not only are outsiders deficient method-ologically, they are, as our "just world" }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B78}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B78}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F78 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN78]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  requires, also dispositionally deserving of their fate.  Posner, for example, claims that some }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *148}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  competitors may have fared better if only they were not so spiteful about their losses and, so unwilling "to pick up the analytic techniques and models of economic analysis and use them in their own work." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B79}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B79}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F79 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN79]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   According to Posner, "no one likes to retool with the methods of a rival discipline; it is a confession of defeat." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B80}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B80}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F80 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN80]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The source of the competitors' failure is, in Posner's account, not }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber23}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber23}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 in the situation of the competition, but in the dispositions of the participants.  And it is not just any disposition, but the disposition of selfishness--the very disposition that motivates the agents of legal economists' models.  And it is also, in Posner's view, the disposition of spite and smallness--the very sort of qualities that psychologists have shown that we are motivated to see in "out groups" and to deny in our own groups, and that consequently enable us to feel that the misfortunes of "others" are warranted. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B81}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B81}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F81 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN81]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Consequently, there are two ways in which the largely uncon-tested  "tournament of ideas" notion reflects the fundamental attribution error. First, as we just described, competitors are presumed to win or lose because of dispositional factors.  Second, the operation and dynamics of the tournament itself is presumed to be independent of broader situational influences.  The metaphor of a tournament or marketplace highlights the presumption that comp-etition on the merits is the driving force and that the victor is determined through successful competitive engagements, full stop.  Any forces exogenous to the tournament are rarely identified, much less systematically analyzed.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Again, it is not contradiction, but consistency, that suggests the more revealing aspects of this second puzzle.  Both legal economists and their critics presume a dispositionist account of scholarly behavior.  But again, social psychology instructs us that seemingly dispositional actions are often }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber24}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber24}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 more accurately understood as situational reactions.  The consistent dispositional attributions, therefore, may be consistently wrong.  A more complete solution to this puzzle, however, must await the balance of this Article.}\par

  We named this Part "setting the stage," not simply because it sets the stage for the balance of the Article, but also because it is }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *149}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  intended to begin to illuminate the power of staging over acting.  The stage is not simply the place where independent, dispositional actions occur, as is so commonly, so humanly, assumed.  The stage is itself an unseen participant--one that shapes, transforms, sometimes determines, and almost always influences, the behaviors of the visible characters.  If that is correct, legal scholars and policymakers need to ascertain how the stage is set, who has the power to set it, and what the purpose of the staging is.  We all need to be attentive to the situation.}\par

The gunman informs you that "although the shock can be extremely painful to the person in the chair, it can cause no permanent tissue damage."

  Now, suppose you are strolling across your favorite university campus when you are approached by a clipboard-toting, lab-coated graduate student who is recruiting participants for an ongoing psychological experiment testing learning techniques.  You agree to take part, and follow the graduate student into a building where you meet the professor running the study and another person, who, like yourself, has agreed to participate.  You draw lots and find that in the experiment you will be the "teacher," and your fellow }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *151}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  volunteer will be the "learner."

If the learner fails to provide the correct word, you, as the teacher, are to flip a switch that will shock him.  With each incorrect answer, the strength of the shock will increase by 15 volts.  You follow the professor into an adjacent room where you watch as the learner is strapped into a chair and electrodes are attached to his body.  Then you move back to the first room where the professor begins the experiment.  Very soon into the procedure, the subject gets an association wrong.  Do you flip the switch?}\par

  Perhaps you do.  Now the wrong answers continue to come.  With each mistake you increase the voltage, and you begin to hear the learner moaning in pain. Poised at 150 volts, the learner exclaims that his heart is bothering him. When you reach 210 volts, he demands to be released, saying he refuses to answer any more questions.  At 300 volts, he is screaming in agony.  After 330 volts, the learner's room becomes silent.  The professor continues to ask questions and announces that continued silence will be interpreted as a wrong answer, bringing another shock.  You look at the control panel and see that the next level reads "DANGER: SEVERE SHOCK--XXX--450 volts."  You hesitate, and the professor demands, "You have no other choice, you must go on."

Some clarifying light can be shed on the matter by separating it into two sub-questions.  First, at what point and to what degree do lay people and economists begin to see situation and to take it into account?  In other words, what are the limits to our dispositionism--how fundamental is it?  Second, to what extent do disposition and situation actually move us?  Put differently, how fundamental an error is our dispositionism?  The first question is about how we perceive what we see, and the second question is about how accurate our perceptions are.}\par

  One should not be fooled by this fleeting attributional accuracy, for it is just a consequence of the otherwise dispositional assumptions }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *160}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  behind the rational actor model.

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  As we have already suggested, the reason that economists see the situational role of money is because of their preliminary assumption that people are dispositionally motivated to pursue little else.  Close inspection reveals that economists actually provide an unjustifiably anemic version of their favored situational factor, as their models allow for only a fraction of the situational force of price.  For example, a fundamental assumption of legal economists, one that quietly makes possible much of their analysis, is that a person's willingness to pay equals her willingness to accept for the same item.  That is, a person would be willing to pay as much for a widget as that }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber38}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber38}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 person would be willing to accept in payment from another party for selling that same widget.  That assumption is, for example, central to the Coase Theorem's instruction that well-functioning markets will yield allocatively efficient outcomes.}\par

  Strikingly, despite Becker's demonstration that downward-sloping demand curves do not imply rational behavior, many subsequent economists (particularly legal economists) have ignored or trivialized it. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B127}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B127}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F127 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN127]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The idea that situation is central and disposition is peripheral }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *163}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  has no purchase, given what economists seem to "know" about their world (as confirmed by their human vision and, tautologically, by the shape and slope of the demand curves they have "seen"). }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B128}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B128}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F128 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN128]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   It is as though legal economists, like the rest of us, are so swept up by the play that they forget that they are watching one }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber42}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber42}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 and come to believe that the characters in it are internally, dispositionally motivated.

  Besides the narrow treatment of price and budget, the other major exception to economists' dispositionism is, as for the rest of us, the case in which someone acts in response to a significant threat (usually of force) posed by another person--prototypically a bullet to the brain.  Robert Cooter and Thomas Ulen, in their highly regarded law and economics text, provide a fairly conventional description of when situation should be considered in the law of contracts: }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     [S]ometimes one of the parties to a bargain faces a dire constraint.  A dire constraint leaves the decision-maker with little or no choice.  Contract law treats dire constraints differently . . . . }\par

  Then, at the conclusion of their analysis, they ask the reader to explain the efficiency argument against enforcing the following arrangement: "Suppose that }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber43}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber43}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 person A, while aiming a gun at person B, invites B to write a check." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B131}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B131}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F131 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN131]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   As such hypotheticals illustrate, }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *164}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  situation is easy to see, if not impossible to miss, when it is brandishing a revolver. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B132}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B132}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F132 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN132]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  Along with those scenarios, Cooter and Ulen offer some less dramatic examples, such as a crew threatening to walkout midway through a chartered fishing voyage in an effort to extract higher wages from their captain. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B133}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B133}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F133 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN133]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   But even examples that do not involve violent threats still involve "threats." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B134}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B134}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F134 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN134]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   And those threats are made clear by one or more dispositionally motivated human actors seeking to force one party to act contrary to his or her interests absent the threat.  In other words, only an extremely narrow range of situational factors count--those of dispositionally bad actors.  Cooter and Ulen's lesson is that constraints less "dire" than the sort indicated in their examples are ignored in contract law, and properly so from an economic perspective. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B135}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B135}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F135 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN135]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  But these exceptions do not reveal a true sensitivity to situation; they expose only the tiny and predictable exception to dispositionism that proves the rule.  Indeed, these departures flow from the very same current that creates the more general phenomenon--the fundamental attribution error--to which they are exceptions.  That current, recall, originates from our cognitive tendency to "see" salient actors and features and to miss the rest. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B136}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B136}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F136 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN136]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  The general result is that we tend to attribute a person's actions to her free }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber44}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber44}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 choices because we do not see the influence of situation.

Put differently, a person is seen to give up her seat for an 800-pound gorilla, not by free choice, but because of the half-ton of hairy, menacing situation.

  In sum, there is little or no place in economists' models for situational influences other than prices or narrowly defined threats.

  It is difficult to read about Milgram's experiments and the reactions to them without strongly suspecting that the human presumption is exactly inverted; that what we do not see dominates the little that we do see.

But since those early }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber47}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber47}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 studies, social psychologists have managed to get a better measure of that inversion, a sample of which we will highlight here.}\par

  Even after seeing the film of the obedience experiment and the situational pressures of the experiment, Safer's students still believed that disposition was driving the teachers and would do so even in other situations, including that in which they were given no orders from the experimenter.  When comparing the students' forecasts to the actual results of the control experiment, Safer's students significantly overestimated both the average shock level set by the teachers and the number of teachers who chose the maximum amount of shock absent the most significant situational forces of the original obedience experiment. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B152}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B152}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F152 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN152]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   In other words, Safer's students persisted in believing that the teachers in Milgram's original experiment were motivated by stable disposition rather than the situation of the experiment. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B153}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B153}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F153 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN153]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  In another classic demonstration of this phenomenon, subjects were asked to read a short essay on "Castro's Cuba" and to judge the true attitude of the writer toward Castro.  The subjects were informed that the essay was a prepared answer to an examination question, in which some exam takers were asked to criticize Castro's Cuba and other exam takers were asked to defend it. Subjects thus understood that the writer of any exam had little choice with respect to the position he or she took regarding Castro's Cuba.  Surprisingly, many of the subjects nevertheless associated the writer's true attitude (disposition) toward Castro with the content of the essay.  If the writer wrote a pro-Castro essay as (situationally) directed, many subjects concluded that the writer was privately (dispositionally) pro-Castro, and vice versa. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B155}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B155}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F155 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN155]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Thus, even when situational influences should be obvious and even when people are watching what is tantamount to a play, humans still tend to overestimate the role of disposition.}\par

  Taken together, these experiments help bring into relief the profound power of situation over human action.  They also reveal that such influences are usually left unexamined in our daily lives, in our stories, and in our theories about what moves people.  There was little evidence of a "good seminarian" or a "bad seminarian," but there was much evidence of "situational seminarians." The differ-ence between the priest who passes on and the Samaritan who stops may be more a function of a bad or good situation than of a bad or good disposition. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B178}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B178}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F178 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN178]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

Settings with less compelling situational pressures for help are likely to yield even less "goodness."

  The upside-down causal ascriptions behind the fundamental attribution error are also explained by a more subtle, though as we've emphasized is often the case, no less important understanding of the human animal.  Appreciating its significance requires distin-guishing between two types of fundamental attribution error.  The first is the sort that we have been discussing since opening the Article and that social psychologists have in mind when they use the term.  We will call this the exterior fundamental attribution error.  When humans look at any setting and make causal attributions, certain key features of that setting--the observable actions of individuals--exert disproportionate influence over their evaluations.

Thus, observers give little or no weight to the fact that Milgram's shock box had many switches instead of just one--a distinction that most social psychologists now recognize was likely influential.

  The theoretic primacy of dispositionism also reflects what we call the interior fundamental attribution error.  That error, which is analogous to its }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber59}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber59}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 exterior counterpart, is the tendency to "see" and attribute a powerful causal role to certain salient features of our interior that exercise comparatively little causal influence over our behavior while, at the same time, failing to see those interior features that are highly influential.  Those salient features of our interior that we see, in turn, make possible (if not likely) a theory of ourselves in which dispositions play a role--usually the dominant role--in our behavior.  We are primed by our felt interior experience to see dispositions and to overlook a potentially more significant influence--the situation.  In that way, the interior fundamental attribution error contributes significantly to the exterior fundamental attribution error.}\par

The theoretical foundation of the legal realist tradition includes "a 'scientific outlook' that posits a knowable world out there beyond the text, a world whose workings are not transparent and which invite exploration to discern their deeper and truer contours." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B202}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B202}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F202 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN202]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  This tradition of realism has been driven by the desire to "explain legal realities" through a commitment to the belief that "legal scholarship (and law) will be enriched by the application of science." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B203}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B203}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F203 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN203]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The "science" of this tradition is a social science, for the realist is committed to the consequentialist belief that "the meaning of law resides in its effects on human well-being (variously conceived) }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *182}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  rather than in its formal characteristics." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B204}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B204}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F204 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN204]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Perhaps most import-antly, legal realists believe that their task is not only important, but promising; the history of realism has been advanced under "a conviction that knowledge derived from [its] }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber63}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber63}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 undertaking can promote greater felicity by modifying social arrangements." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B205}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B205}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F205 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN205]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   We will return to this discussion of realism, but we first want to briefly explain the "critical" side of critical realism.}\par

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  We do not see any necessary contradiction between the "realism" leg and the "critical" leg of our approach, and it is in part our belief that a successful legal theory must stand on both legs that motivates this project. Social scientists are never free from the deep biases that shadow human thinking, and they should therefore be continually self-critical and suspicious of the "knowledge" they produce.  Nevertheless, social science done well can help us understand those biases and limitations, and, in turn, their influence over our theories and institutions.  Such insights can assist us in better }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber64}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber64}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 understanding our social arrangements and in improving overall well-being.}\par

  With that, we can describe a second, even more important facet of what we mean by "critical realism."

  For example, in an article devoted to considering the implications of cognitive psychology for existing products liability laws, Professors Henderson }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber66}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber66}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 and Rachlinski generally assume that consumers are dispositional, if cognitively biased, actors.  However, they con-clude their article by briefly acknowledging the possibility that stable preferences may not in fact underlie consumer "choices": }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     The notion that manufacturers distort consumer risk--perception assumes that there is some natural and appropriate risk-benefit assessment from which manufacturers lead consumers astray.  If we take seriously the psychological proposition that all preferences are constructed, then there is no magical correct level of risk that consumers should endure. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B211}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B211}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F211 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN211]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  Their point seems to be that if policymakers were to take seriously that possibility, then policy theory as we know it would be rendered largely meaningless.  We may agree with that claim.  But Henderson and Rachlinksi's closing observation highlights a troubling and common unwillingness--even among cognitive psychologists like Rachlinski--to confront the reality that the available evidence reveals.  If the implications of cognitive psychology are as drastic as Henderson and Rachlinski suggest they might be, then why highlight those implications only in a concluding comment, rather than beginning with them?  And why would Henderson and Rachlinski largely ignore those implications in reaching definitive policy prescriptions throughout their article (and work)? }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B212}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B212}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F212 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN212]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

As he sees it, individualism and autonomy are themselves threatened by what behavioralism demonstrates, a threat that counsels caution: }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     [Behavioralism's insights] cannot possibly translate into a justification for greater constraints on individual decision making.

These are not the words of social scientists pursuing truth wherever it leads them.

  What we do and do not mean by "critical realism" will become clearer below.  But before introducing one of its important implications, it may be helpful to summarize several strong presumptions or axioms that we intend critical realism to build upon--principles that we have suggested in our discussion to this point:}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
}{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber76}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber76}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   \uc0 \u8226  First, we--scholars and non-scholars alike--do not understand ourselves well, and certainly not as well as we think we do.}\par

  }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *192}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  \uc0 \u8226  Second, the process of developing theories or models is a human one and is therefore subject to all sorts of biases and unperceived influences.  It is largely for that reason that the impressions and models--informal and formal--that we legal scholars have created to help us understand ourselves tend to be flawed and self-serving.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  \uc0 \u8226  Third, we cannot hope to make sense of our institutions or ourselves until we better understand how humans go about trying to make sense of themselves and their institutions.

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  \uc0 \u8226  And, fourth, a promising way to understand human cognition and behavior is to begin with those schools of thought and those institutions that are devoted to understanding human cognition and behavior.

  2. Looking for Power}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  We have three problems with Posner's rationale for ignoring power.  First, what good is a theory that ignores a force so potentially influential that it is actually called "power," purely for the sake of maintaining an operable model?  "Power economics," an element of }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *197}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  critical realism, is committed to starting with power and developing our understanding or model of human behavior from there.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Second, any obstacle in operationalizing the concept of power may reflect the unrealistic starting presumptions of legal economists more than the inherent difficulty of incorporating power into a viable social scientific theory.  Were economists more committed to understanding human behavior, they would be better }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber82}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber82}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 able to model it.  The ghostly quality of power, we hope to show, is less in the object and more in the lens.  Change the lens and power is more likely to come into focus and will sometimes be as obvious as a gun to the head.  This leads to our third point.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  The clear message of Milgram's experiments is that situation influences us.  But Milgram's decades-old findings serve as just one example of a much larger situation.  "Social psychology has by now amassed a vast store of such empirical parables." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B250}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B250}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F250 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN250]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The deeper implication of those experiments is that situation can be managed, shaped, arranged, and constructed to influence us in ways that we do not anticipate or appreciate.  Situation is thus a source and vehicle of power.  Milgram, after all, designed and created the situation in his laboratory.  Unfortunately the pursuit of academic or scientific knowledge is not the only motive that might shape the scenery that surrounds and moves us.}\par

B. Economics}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  And here is where the economics of "power economics" comes into play.  What we know about the situational character makes clear that people's behavior is influenced by situational factors.  Thus, the ability to influence the situation is also the ability to influence people's behavior.  Such power can be profitable.  Because power is valuable to those who wield it, and insofar as }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber83}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber83}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 power can be exercised through (invisible or, at least, unobserved) situational variables, those variables are themselves manipulable.  And because those variables are manipulable, profit-driven agents will compete to control or influence them and, in turn, the people and institutions that tend to be blindly moved by them.  More succinctly, once situation is understood as the locus of influence, it follows that situation will trade like mousetraps and widgets.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *198}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  Market actors will exert power--whether or not they are aware of it-- because of the situational pressures of the market.  If profit can be made by influencing the situation, we predict that it will be.  Market competitors will, to survive in the long run, "discover" precisely which situational manipulations most efficiently influence us and how.  Market actors who fail to manipulate situational variables effectively will sooner or later be supplanted by those who do.}\par

  If there is uncertainty regarding the precise workings of power--the particular mechanisms by which situational influence is wielded--that is a problem of description, not of economics.  The market will discover those workings and exploit them.  Because market actors will, indeed must, attend to the operation of power, legal economists have no excuse, even on operational grounds, for ignoring it.

This power would be much more remarked and resisted were it not for the social conditioning of economics and its instruction.

}{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber91}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber91}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Look carefully at the structure of Stigler's work--at least as we have summarized it.  Stigler was challenging a long-held conven-tional wisdom that governments and their agencies create beneficial regulations.  Underlying that conventional wisdom was the supp-osition that regulatory processes were fair and that regulators were dispositionally motivated to serve the public interest.  Stigler's challenge to those suppositions was initiated by his discovery that, in fact, a sanguine view of our regulatory institutions had no empirical basis and that, if anything, those institutions' actions were counterproductive to their espoused goals.  To explain the phenomenon, Stigler looked to the outside influences on regulators and described how different groups were able to exert power over the regulators.  Thus, Stigler contested the reassuring conventional wisdom that our institutions are neutral and well-functioning and rejected the idea that the stated goals of regulators are controlling.  He did so by downplaying dispositional factors and emphasizing situational factors. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B282}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B282}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F282 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN282]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   By taking situation seriously, he raised the issue of power inasmuch as situations are largely defined by allocations and dynamics of power.

  1. Some Deep Implications of Shallow Capture}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  In identifying the phenomenon of capture, Stigler and his contemporaries obliterated the once-conventional view of regulation.  They refuted the naive presumption that had long been protected behind the ambiguous (and, therefore, easily defended) concept of "the public interest," and provided a far more realistic (albeit disturbing) account of the sources and effects of regulation.  Regulation was "caused" less by public-spirited and well-advised regulators and more by the situational constraints imposed upon them by competing economic entities, with the most powerful entities wielding the most influence.  In other words, Stigler, identified and substantially overturned what might be called the regulatory fundamental attribution error.  The older "public interest" regulatory theory maintained a kind of dispositionist view of a constant figure, evaluating influences, measuring public welfare, and }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *213}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  making decisions accordingly. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B303}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B303}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F303 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN303]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Regulatory theory essentially rested on a view of the regulator as a rational actor whose stable preferences were in the public interest.  By studying the regulator's actions and ignoring the regulator's words, economists like Stigler were able to see new patterns and surmise some of the situational influences that generated them.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  But Stigler's work barely breaks the surface of situationism and identifies only a very shallow form of capture.  When one takes seriously the power of the }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber98}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber98}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 situation--exterior and interior }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B304}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B304}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F304 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN304]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 --one can begin to understand the potential depths of capture.  There are several ways in which capture is likely to run much deeper than Stigler, or others applying and advancing his insights, have recognized.}\par

  2. The Depth of Capture}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Again, returning to Galileo's story may help make evident what is invisible in our midst.  First, as the Catholic Church's efforts revealed, there are other capture-worthy and capturable institutions and individuals beyond merely administrative regulators.  Recall that Galileo had no official regulatory authority either in the state or in the Church.  What he had was a certain level of public legitimacy, and therefore power, as a renowned scientist. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B305}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B305}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F305 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN305]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   His theories, evidence, and conclusions were important as a confirmation of, or challenge to, the "truth" of the Church's teachings. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B306}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B306}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F306 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN306]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   As a result, Galileo's positions were well worth capturing. Similarly, today any institutions or individuals capable of influencing existing wealth and power distributions will be subject to the pressures of capture.  In this sense, Stigler and those who subscribe to his theory are, like the public-interest theorists they replaced, far too shallow.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  If administrative regulators are vulnerable to the forces of capture by certain interests, as most everyone agrees they are, then }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *214}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  the likelihood of a deeper capture seems undeniable.  There is nothing special }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber99}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber99}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 about administrative regulators--except, perhaps, the general concern that they may be captured.  Virtually every other institution in our society seems just as vulnerable.  After all, contemporary scholars and commentators have rarely even considered, much less taken seriously, the problem of deep capture.  Given that nescience, one would expect other institutions to be constructed without heed to the dynamics of capture.  In a world without foxes, a farmer will not guard the hen-house.  And because deep capture occurs situationally--outside of view by, and with the induced consent of, the captured--any loss of eggs will either go unnoticed or will be perceived as natural and just.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  There is a second general way in which traditional capture theory is too shallow.  To see this, it is necessary to look deeper than the behavior of the captured institutions and individuals.  Beneath the surface of behavior, the interior situation of relevant actors is also subject to capture.  Indeed, much of the power of deep capture comes from the fact that its targets include the way that people think and the way that they think they think.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }

The highest crime an individual could commit was that of heresy--the word itself deriving from the Greek word hairesis, meaning "choice." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B312}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B312}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F312 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN312]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   In order }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *216}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  to prevent the wider populace from realizing that a "choice" existed, Galileo had to be silenced.}\par

  Those in power thus captured the institutions and individuals that threatened their dominant position, including an individual scientist capable of altering ideas or knowledge in a way that might weaken their power.  They did so through a process intended to suggest that Galileo freely chose his recantation and resultant silence.  Galileo, wisely, did not proclaim that he was being forced to recant under the threat of death; he stated instead that he was trying to clarify the possible confusion that his errors had created and make clear that he, upon reflection, "abjure[d], curse[d], and detest[ed] the above-mentioned errors and heresies . . . ." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B313}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B313}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F313 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN313]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The Church thus applied situational pressure to generate the appearance of "dispositional" recantation.

  Understanding that capture is directed at both our exteriors and interiors clears up some confusion and debate in the shallow capture literature.  When Stigler's evidence of capture emerged, economists, political scientists, and public choice theorists got busy trying to identify the precise mechanics of }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber102}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber102}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 the regulatory black box that Stigler mostly ignored.  True to form, they began with the rational actor model of human behavior and sought to explain capture as the consequence of the self-interested, maximizing dispositions of individual regulators. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B314}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B314}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F314 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN314]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Yet, while simple formulations have given way to increasingly elaborate ones, }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B315}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B315}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F315 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN315]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  public-choice theory is still dogged by the fact that it is unrealistically "cynical" (meaning that the assumed dispositions of regulatory actors are perceived to be }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *217}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  unrealistically selfish).  After all, many governmental actors and reg-ulatory agents often claim, and actually seem to be, motivated by the public interest and try to act that way; }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B316}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B316}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F316 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN316]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  that is, many regulators' actions appear more consistent with their ideological beliefs than with a narrow conception of self-interest. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B317}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B317}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F317 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN317]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  The problem with shallow capture is not that it cannot always explain the part played by the dispositions of regulatory actors, but rather that it takes dispositions so seriously in the first place.  Deep capture makes clear that people's intentions and beliefs may have little to do with their behavior and that, insofar as they do, those intentions and beliefs are part of what interests compete to capture.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  When Catholic astronomers of the seventeenth century stated that they believed, as most profoundly did, that the Earth was at the center of the universe, deep capture was at work.  Their astronomy was part of a larger, }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber103}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber103}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 interconnected set of truths taught to them in seminary and reinforced at many turns--some seen, some unseen--in their society.  Similarly, lay people had no reason to dispute those truths and faced situational influences just as powerful, despite being less visible, as the gun to the head or fire to the feet that Galileo experienced.  That a regulator may act out of ideological dispositions no more implies that she is free from capture than the changing lengths of shadows on a summer afternoon implies that the sun is revolving around the Earth.}\par

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  By "deep capture," then, we are referring to the disproportionate and self-serving influence that the relatively powerful tend to exert over all the exterior and interior situational features that materially influence the maintenance and extension of that power--including those features that purport to be, and that we experience as, independent, volitional, and benign.  Because the situation generally tends to be invisible (or nearly so) to us, deep capture tends to be as well.}\par

}{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber104}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber104}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   This raises the question: if deep capture is so hard to see, then why is it so obvious in the Galileo example?  There are several reasons.  To begin with, at the time, we doubt that it was so visible.  We suspect that few observers saw anything untoward or illegitimate about Galileo's inquisitorial experience or any reason to doubt the "knowledge" that it produced. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B318}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B318}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F318 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN318]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The situational pressures that, to us, were glaringly excessive during the Inquisition were probably not perceived as excessive at the time. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B319}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B319}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F319 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN319]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  The situational forces confronting Galileo may be easier for us to see now because we live in a radically different environment.  We are looking at another generation of people in another country }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *219}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  whose situational worldviews we reject and whose victim, Galileo, we revere. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B320}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B320}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F320 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN320]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   They are "them," and Galileo is "us."

The role of disposition and deep capture in the Galileo story is, today and to us, conspicuous, almost palpable.  But seeing our own situation and its deep capture is not.}\par

  4. Learning from History}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  For some of the same reasons that it is difficult to convince people that they would have been influenced by the situational cues in the Milgram }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber105}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber105}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 experiment, }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B322}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B322}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F322 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN322]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  it is nearly impossible to convince people that they live in, and are part of, a deeply captured world.  To make our preliminary case, therefore, we will attempt to demonstrate that the situation today is very similar to the situation that existed in Galileo's Italy.  Because the existence of deep capture is easy to see and accept there, by observing it, we may be better able to see and accept deep capture now.  Perhaps by seeing that we are subject to a parallel influence over a parallel issue, we may be able to more clearly see ourselves, not in the heroic Galileo, but in the complacent and complicit adherents of the common sense of his day, or even in the reactionary Bellarmine.}\par

  a. Institutions to deeply capture}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  The first parallel is the existence of an institution or collection of institutions with immense wealth and power and, thus, both the ability and desire to influence exterior and interior situations to enhance those advantages.  In the Galileo story, that collection of }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *220}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  institutions is, for the sake of simplicity, often treated as an individual actor under the heading of "the Catholic Church" or "the Vatican."  Today, we hypothesize that the institutions with the means and the motive to engage in deep capture are large corporations. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B323}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B323}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F323 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN323]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   In virtually any present metric and manner of understanding power, corporations easily qualify as immensely powerful.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Let us start with corporations' immense wealth, a fundamental component of }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber106}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber106}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 power in our market economy.  As is so often emphasized by legal economists, resources have a tendency through market processes to move to those who value them most, as measured by relative willingness to pay. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B324}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B324}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F324 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN324]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Willingness to pay, of course, is heavily determined by ability to pay.  No institutional actor controls as much wealth in so concentrated a fashion in our society today as do corporations and those individuals with an important stake in promoting the power of corporations. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B325}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B325}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F325 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN325]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Thus, valuable resources (including influence over the situation) tend toward those with the greatest ability to pay--that is, corporations.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Large corporate interests have several other power advantages beyond their wealth--advantages that likely help them to amass that wealth in the first place.  For instance, like Stigler's beekeepers, }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B326}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B326}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F326 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN326]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  they enjoy a common single interest and thus an advantage in the competition to influence--an assertion that finds considerable support in the shallow capture literature. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B327}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B327}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F327 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN327]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Insofar as each corporation is devoted to the single goal of profit maximization, they are, even as they compete in the marketplace, collectively committed }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *221}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  to a uniform regulatory end: the creation and maintenance of a world that maximizes profit opportunities. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B328}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B328}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F328 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN328]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Moreover, corporations are--in part because of market processes-- profoundly effective at uncovering and exploiting the most efficient and reliable means of influencing people and insti-tutions, a pursuit that will }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber107}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber107}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 extend through situational influences. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B329}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B329}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F329 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN329]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Advertising, marketing, lobbying, and public relations are only the most obvious activities that corporations have refined in their profit-maximizing pursuits.  Even those practices are largely obscured by our dispositionism and largely invisible in our theories }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B330}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B330}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F330 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN330]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 --an obscurity that renders them all the more effective.  In future work, we hope to describe those practices in more detail.  For now, our point is that the situation of market competition has led corporations to become far more expert at manipulating situational factors than other institutions or individuals have had the need or wherewithal to accomplish.}\par

  Finally, the livelihood or economic well-being of the majority of our population is perceived to depend directly or indirectly on the health of corporations--individually and collectively.  For example, many people work for corporations, many people invest in corpor-ations, and, more generally, the overall health of the economy, in which most of us feel we have a significant stake, is perceived to depend on the collective health of corporations. Corporate scholars Henry Hansmann and Reinier Kraakman, for instance, recently described the expanding base of shareholders as follows: }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     Stock ownership is becoming more pervasive everywhere.  No longer is it confined to a small group of wealthy citizens.

In recent years, however, it has accelerated substantially.  Since the Second World War, an ever-}{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *222}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  increasing number of American workers have had their savings invested in corporate equities through pension funds.  Over the same period, the mutual fund industry has also expanded rapidly, becoming the repository of an ever-increasing share of nonpension savings for the population at large. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B331}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B331}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F331 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN331]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  This is not just an academic point.  President George W. Bush has been emphasizing this theme repeatedly in the wake of corporate debacles since he took office.  In response to Enron revelations, for instance, he explained: }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     The reason that a single bankruptcy can cause so much concern in America is that more Americans than ever have invested their money in public corporations.  Today, about 80 million Americans own stock, either individually or through their pension plans.  This is one of the causes for the expansion in personal wealth over the past 20 years.  This has been an incredibly positive development for America.  Stock ownership allows citizens from all walks of life to own a part of the economy and to share in its growth.  The people who run public companies owe a special obligation to these investors, many of whom have put their savings and future security on the line. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B332}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B332}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F332 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN332]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

As Hansmann and Kraakman put it: }\par

b. Fundamental attribution errors}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The second major parallel between our world and Galileo's is the existence of a widely held attributional intuition that is false, but generally viewed as a "truth"--and an obvious one at that.

  To the Catholic Church, maintaining an allegiance to the biblical account of astronomical structure, no matter how logically dubious, was extremely important.

  The insistence on intellectual conformity in scientific and philosophical subjects was intimately connected to the Church's reaction to a far more fundamental challenge to its authority, that of the Protestant Reformation.

The result was a more personal, individualized experience and interpretation of the scriptures. To the Catholic hierarchy, this was the work of the devil.

Phenomena such as trade associations for lobbying, industry- and sector-wide advertising and public relations, and illegal collaborative activities such as price-fixing, evince these shared interests amongst competitors. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B343}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B343}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F343 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN343]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Coordinated lobbying efforts for policy initiatives like NAFTA }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B344}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B344}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F344 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN344]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  and for one-or-another political candidate, }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B345}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B345}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F345 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN345]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  demonstrate a shared corp-orate interest across markets.  But corporations share an interest in more than just promoting, for example, global trade policy.  They also share a deeper interest in promoting certain perceptions of global trade policy, and of many other issues that can influence their common pursuit of profits.  It is our contention that a dispositionist worldview benefits both individual corporations and the shared corporate interest, and that corporations therefore individually and jointly will act situationally to promote it.  Because this claim is a major feature of our larger thesis, and because defending it is somewhat complex, it will be the topic of a separate article. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B346}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B346}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F346 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN346]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   We urge the reader to accept, or at least suspend disbelief in, this claim until we can flesh it out and (we hope) thoroughly substantiate it.

  One important reason that corporations have a stake in dispositionism is that }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber113}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber113}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 it is the dispositionist perspective that largely justifies their profit-seeking behavior as socially beneficial.  If consumers are assumed to be dispositional--that is, if they act according to a stable set of preferences that only they can access directly--then it plausibly follows that the best way to maximize }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *227}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  welfare is to allow consumers to satisfy their preferences through free-market transactions.  It is through free markets that otherwise invisible preferences are satisfied (and revealed) through mutually beneficial transactions that enhance overall social welfare.  As profit-maximizing entities, corporations act to maximize social welfare by serving consumers' supposed dispositional preferences.  Profit is the substantiation of those welfare-enhancing transactions and is there-fore, by definition, good.  In short, profit-maximizing corporations act in the public interest. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B347}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B347}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F347 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN347]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  A dispositionist worldview is similarly valuable to the corporate interest because it helps minimize profit-reducing regulation.  Markets, which allow the free exercise of dispositions, are understood as more responsive to consumer preferences than regulators who lack good information and the appropriate incentives.  The dispositionist presumption translates to a presumption against regulatory intervention even against visible harms, for the actors involved are presumed to be choosing the inevitable risks that gave rise to those harms.  Regulatory intervention is warranted only in circumstances in which markets demonstrably fail to respond to consumer dispositions--for }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber114}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber114}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 instance, when consumers clearly lack information or when a transaction creates significant negative externalities.  But, even in the presence of such market imperfections, calls for regulation may be rebutted on the grounds that imperfect markets might be preferable to imperfect regulations.  Expressions like "the nirvana fallacy" and "the law of unintended consequences" have been coined to capture this fallback defense of markets. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B348}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B348}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F348 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN348]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Dispositionism also helps support common arguments for why regulators cannot be trusted.  Regulators, like the rest of us, are presumed to be motivated to satisfy their self-interest, }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B349}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B349}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F349 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN349]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  an end that is often in tension with their purported goal of serving the public interest.  Regulators are often depicted as concerned with job security, career advancement, and larger budgets, as well-meaning but ill-informed bunglers, or as zealous intermeddlers seeking to }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *228}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  impose their visions of society upon otherwise free consumers.  Such dispositions are likely to lead to wrongful interference in free choices and, consequently, inefficient outcomes--the apparent dispositional mechanism behind Stigler's findings.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Another benefit of dispositionism is that it helps to preserve and legitimate the status quo, in which corporations are the wealthiest and most powerful entities.  Dispositionism places consumers, not corporations, in the driver's seat.  Corporations are viewed as com-peting to fulfill consumers' desires in a fair competition; they are viewed as having no role in creating or influencing }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber115}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber115}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 consumers' behavior.  If consumers are unhappy with one or another outcome of that competitive process, they are rebuffed with the observation that the process is fair and that consumers have no one but themselves to blame.  If consumers claim not to like a given market outcome, they can be told to change their consumption choices, reexamine their perceived preferences, or take it up with their fellow consumers.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  In addition, corporations gain in innumerable ways from the general human tendency--reflected in the fundamental attribution error--to attach disproportionate weight to what we see and to see only a small, salient subset of our environs and interiors.  This phenomenon has many manifestations that tend to benefit large commercial interests.  For example, when the situation is not obvious (as is generally the case), people believe they are acting autonomously when they are actually responding to unseen situational cues.  Not only do they miss the situational influence, they don't believe there is a situational influence.  Consumers are like competitors in a sprint, who, not seeing the track, presume that it is flat and fair.  The runners measure their dispositions--talent and drive--according to the outcome of the race, without regard to its situation.  In such a setting, corporations can camouflage their situational manipulations behind reassurances that those subject to them are, in fact, dispositionally moved.  That same tendency permits corporations to attribute particularly egregious corporate activities to the dispositions of }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber116}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber116}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 the handful of human actors involved or the rather unique corporate disposition (culture) of one corporation, and not to larger situational influences that might implicate, say, all corporations or all of corporate law.}\par

  Galileo's conflict with the Church was not a neutral scientific debate.  It had profound implications for power--who would have it and how it would be wielded--in seventeenth-century Europe.  Similarly, the divide between dispositionism and situationism is not }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *229}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  an academic point.  It has profound implications for the distribution of power in our society.  Large corporations have a stake in a dispositionist worldview because it helps them create and maintain vast situational power.  Indeed, by promoting a lopsided worldview, based on individual stable preferences and autonomous individual choices, corporations can actually curtail individual autonomy and alter perceived preferences.  That is possible, we assert, because of dispositionism.}\par

  Thus, Powell views consumers as "free citizens," who should therefore be allowed to "choose the products and services they want."

What is good policy is to carefully examine rules to determine if they are actually achieving their stated purposes, or if, instead, they are, in fact, denying consumers value by impeding efficient market developments that these consumers would welcome.  Regulations are not innocuous simply because they are promulgated in the name of consumers.

Competitive markets also reduce the need for central collection of information; their price signals allow producers and consumers to respond quickly to change.  Finally, competitive markets tend to decentralize power and make decisions that are fair in the sense of being impersonal.  For these reasons, reliance on the market should be the norm. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B373}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B373}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F373 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN373]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

But what the ALI Reporters are indicating, of course, is that through decentralized individual choice, a collective determination or variety of determinations is made by consumers.  The belief that consumers best know their own interests and, through choice-based behavior, are best able to act on that knowledge, is sometimes known as consumer sovereignty--the normative principle that the ALI Reporters explicitly endorsed. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B389}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B389}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F389 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN389]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  Whether the ALI Reporters were in fact making such an analogy, we (and perhaps they) cannot know.  But we do know that legal scholars have been explicit in making just that comparison.  For example, in a recent article, Robert Lande writes: }\par

  But there is more to it than that.  If one looks beyond the legal reporters and law reviews, one will encounter many other, far less formal, "regulatory" institutions that seek to promote dispositionism.

  The similarity of "seeing yourself as a king" and "consumer sovereignty" is hard to miss and may not be an accident.  The message not only encourages consumers to purchase cigarettes, it also suggests some of the larger possible stakes that commercial interests have in dispositionism.  After all, if the consumer is king, then it is hard to justify making manufacturers pay for simply following orders.  And this ability to place responsibility squarely on consumers--to say in a tort case, for instance, that they "assumed the risk" of their actions--has been fundamental to the tobacco industry's success in selling a product believed to cause more than 440,000 premature deaths per year in the United States alone. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B402}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B402}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F402 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN402]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *248}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  Thus, an important reason that sellers might embrace and encourage dispositionism is their hope of shifting responsibility and avoiding costly regulation or liability. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B403}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B403}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F403 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN403]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

C. Some Cross-Cultural Evidence of Deep Capture }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     My research has led me to the conviction that two utterly different approaches to the world have maintained themselves for thousands of years. These approaches include profoundly different social relations, views about the nature of the world, and characteristic thought processes.

  The previous Sections provided a sample of evidence suggesting that various regulatory institutions are, indeed, highly dispositionist.  This evidence should not be surprising, given that social psychologists have demonstrated that we humans tend to see the world dispositionally.  So, although the evidence might be consistent with our deep capture hypothesis and might well reveal a major cause for concern, it may only evince a shared cognitive illusion--a worldview that emerges solely from forces outside of anyone's control.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  An important implication of deep capture is that our dispositionism is, at least in this market-oriented culture, more }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *251}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  profound than it would otherwise be.  Corporations exercise their enormous power over situation to encourage and reinforce dispositionism because it is valuable to them.  This presumes that the basic contours of our outlook are malleable, that even dispositionism is not stable but is subject to situational influence.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  A question thus emerges as to whether dispositionism reflects anything more than our hardwiring as humans--a shared interior situation.  The answer seems to be that it does.  As we have already indicated, dispositionism varies }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber137}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber137}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 somewhat across contexts.  Thus, exterior situation matters too.  Social psychologists have begun looking more specifically at the significance of culture.  In a revealing study by Takahiko Masuda and Richard Nisbett, for example, students at Kyoto University and the University of Michigan were shown animated underwater scenes containing images of various undersea objects, such as rocks, small fish, plants, and a "focal fish." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B416}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B416}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F416 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN416]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The focal fish was larger, brighter and faster moving than the others--the sort of characteristics that would, according to conventional understandings, make them more salient to the observer. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B417}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B417}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F417 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN417]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   After viewing the scenes, students were asked to describe what they saw.

  According to Nisbett, such evidence confirms the hypothesis that members of some cultures are more inclined to take in the world as if through a }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber138}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber138}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 wide-angle lens, whereas members of other cultures tend to see the world as if through a zoom. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B421}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B421}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F421 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN421]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Nisbett argues that this }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *252}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  distinction across cultures has ancient roots and may even help explain why the Chinese made connections that Aristotle and Galileo, with their telescopic vision, missed: }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     The Greeks' focus on the salient object and its attributes led to their failure to understand the fundamental nature of causality.  Aristotle explained that a stone falling through the air is due to the stone having the property of 'gravity.'  But of course a piece of wood tossed into water floats instead of sinking.  This phenomenon Aristotle explained as being due to the wood having the property of 'levity'!  In both cases the focus is exclusively on the object, with no attention paid to the possibility that some force outside the object might be relevant.  But the Chinese saw the world as consisting of continuously interacting substances, so their attempts to understand it caused them to be oriented toward the complexities of the entire 'field,' that is, the context or environment as a whole.  The notion that events always occur in a field of forces would have been completely intuitive to the Chinese.  The Chinese therefore had a kind of recognition of the principle of 'action at a distance' two thousand years before Galileo articulated it.  They had knowledge of magnetism and acoustic resonance, for example, and believed it was the movement of the moon that caused the tides, a fact that eluded even Galileo. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B422}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B422}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F422 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN422]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  Thus, the tendency goes beyond }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber139}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber139}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 perception of non-human objects and is revealed as well in how "Easterners" and "Westerners" conceptualize and construe social contexts. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B423}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B423}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F423 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN423]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  Recall the fundamental attribution error that is at the heart of dispositionism fallacy--the tendency to miss the influence of situation and to overstate the power of disposition in understanding one's own and other people's behavior.

  As we just reviewed, evidence about cultural variation of dispositionism is consistent with our deep capture hypothesis in a number of ways.  However, that evidence, by itself, does little to demonstrate that corporate efforts are an }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber145}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber145}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 important cause of the heightened dispositionism of the West.  Many would argue that any causal connection is actually the reverse of the one we have hypothesized.  For instance, the prominence and success of commercial interests in America could well reflect the heightened dispositionism of Americans.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  There is almost certainly some truth to that view.  The American self-conception is one of individualism, a sibling concept of what we refer to as dispositionism.  This individualism seemed to emerge without much obvious encouragement by large commercial interests and is sometimes associated with people like Henry David Thoreau, who seem anything but deeply captured. President Herbert Hoover saw individualism as the cornerstone of the American character (or disposition): }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     Individualism has been the primary force of American civilization for three centuries.  It is our sort of individualism that has supplied the motivation of America's political, economic, and spiritual institutions in all these years. It has proved its ability to develop its institutions with the changing scene. Our very form of government is the product of the individualism of our people, the demand for an equal opportunity, for a fair chance. }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     The American pioneer is the epic expression of that individualism, and the pioneer spirit is the response to the challenge of opportunity, to the challenge of nature, to the challenge of life, to the call of the frontier. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber146}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber146}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B453}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B453}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F453 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN453]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

That self-affirming self-conception may, however, be yet another example of the fundamental attribution error.  In our view, attributing our success to our individualist disposition misses the more significant role of our }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *261}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  situation, which itself has fostered success and rendered more plausible our self-conception.

  }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *262}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  Be that as it may, the fact that different cultures tend to be more or less dispositionist reveals how dispositionism can itself be influenced by the situation, thus leaving the door open for deep capture.

Similarly, one would expect advertisers to reflect that same view, by design or not, in marketing their products in America.

  That the Marlboro Man portrays an image of "free choice" should come as no surprise.  It is more than an appeal to an active American script; it also deepens that script.

Those }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber153}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber153}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 sources can be either exterior situational influences, such as peer pressure, or interior situational influences, such as addiction.

  After discovering the unexpected power of the situation in his initial experiment, Milgram altered the situation in the hope of making visible some of the previously unseen influences.  One of the key factors he varied was the credibility or authority of the person who gave orders to the teacher.  In the basic experiment, recall that the person prompting the teacher to continue shocking appeared as a scientist, complete with a white lab coat.  He seemed to have considerable knowledge and authority.  When Milgram replaced that "experimenter" with an "ordinary man" to give the orders, the percentage of }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber156}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber156}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 teachers who administered the maximum shock (450 volts) dropped from approximately sixty-five percent to twenty percent. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B489}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B489}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F489 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN489]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Apparently, the same words were less persuasive or }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *270}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  influential when they came from a less credible or authoritative source.

  This underscores an important element of the deep capture hypothesis: the quest to promote certain ideas will include an endeavor to locate, create, and sponsor credible means of conveying those ideas.  Often, those with the greatest stake in an idea have, for precisely that reason, questionable credibility when speaking on behalf of the idea.  Thus, the search for an effective means of communication often includes a search for trustworthy spokespeople.  The public relations firm Burson-Marsteller makes the point in just those terms when it describes its primary strategy as that of "having [one's] messages . . . communicated through a credible third party" in order to "influenc[e] those who influence a targeted audience." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B492}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B492}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F492 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN492]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  Olin money, as we will describe in more detail in subsequent work, has a significant influence not only in encouraging certain types of scholarship, }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B511}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B511}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F511 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN511]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  but also in increasing the credibility of that scholarship.  It establishes "centers" dedicated to law and economics theory, provides funding for journals through which law and economics scholarship can be stamped with the legitimacy of "peer review" by other legal economists, finances a series of workshops to encourage efficiency-oriented scholars to share and test their views at elite law schools, and gives scholarships and fellowships to top law students who participate in law and economics seminars and produce law and economics scholarship. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B512}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B512}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F512 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN512]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   In short, Olin money has helped to create }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber162}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber162}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 and advance a critical mass of legal scholars, who begin with the strong dispositionist axioms of neoclassical economics, who write largely for one another and policymakers, and who view themselves (and are viewed by many others) as the only genuinely social scientific members of the legal academy.}\par

  The success of the Olin Foundation's funding of law and economics seems fairly dramatic.  Professor Steven Shavell, the director of Harvard Law School's Olin Program, recently provided one measure of that achievement. Professor Shavell surveyed the academic appointments at the "top 10" law schools over the last }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *275}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  decade. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B513}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B513}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F513 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN513]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Of forty-three total placements, he found that, twenty-three were Harvard Law School graduates, and ten of those had been Olin fellows. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B514}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B514}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F514 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN514]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   As Professor Shavell told the Boston Globe, "[i]n the long run, we're going to have a heck of an impact on who's teaching at the leading law schools, and what the students are learning." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B515}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B515}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F515 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN515]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  We would go further.  The Olin Foundation and the law and economics scholarship that it has subsidized have already had "a heck of an impact." Indeed, the scholarly project that the Olin money has sponsored is the same project that is widely understood today to be the dominant paradigm for policy analysis. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B516}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B516}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F516 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN516]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Professor Shavell has emphasized that the economic analysis of law "has changed the nature of legal scholarship, influenced legal practice, and already proven its tremendous value in policymaking and }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber163}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber163}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 business." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B517}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B517}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F517 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN517]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Furthermore, the Olin Foundation's Board of Trustees recently declared that their contributions have "supported a wide range of scholars and writers who significantly changed the content and direction of American academic and political discussion." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B518}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B518}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F518 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN518]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  Of course, the fact that the Olin Foundation poured millions of dollars into promoting law and economics does not necessarily imply that those investments played a significant causal role in the stunning success of the now-dominant paradigm.  It may be, as most of its proponents presume, that law and economics was destined for greatness solely on the merits, and that Olin money simply facilitated an inevitable process that was already underway. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B519}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B519}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F519 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN519]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  There are several reasons to suspect, however, that the Olin Foundation's support, combined with numerous other situational influences, has played a pivotal causal role in the success of the law and economics movement.  First, the success of law and economics appears to map closely with the precise ambitions and strategies of }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *276}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  the key individuals behind the Olin Foundation: John Olin, the founder of the organization, and William Simon, its longtime president.  After leaving his position as Treasury Secretary in the Nixon and Ford Administrations, Simon wrote two best-selling books that outlined his conservative and pro-commercial beliefs and his agenda for implementing them. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B520}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B520}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F520 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN520]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Simon was a prominent, early exponent of the }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber164}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber164}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 dispositionist, neoliberal worldview that seeks to promote private enterprise and to minimize the role of government--a worldview shared by John Olin.  They also shared a belief that American universities at the time produced ideas and graduates that were dangerously antithetical to those ends.  To Simon, this problem was tantamount to a war of liberty versus totalitarianism--a war with three fronts: }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     1. Funds generated by business . . . must rush by multimillions to the aid of liberty, in the many places where it is beleaguered. }\par

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     2. Business must cease the mindless subsidizing of colleges and universities whose departments of economics, government, politics and history are hostile to capitalism and whose faculties will not hire scholars whose views are otherwise. }\par

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     . . . America's major universities are today churning out young collectivists by legions, and it is irrational for businessmen to support }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber165}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber165}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 them. }\par

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     3. Finally, business money must flow . . . to media which are either pro-freedom or, if not necessarily 'pro-business,' at least professionally capable of a fair and accurate treatment of procapitalist ideas, values and arguments.  The judgment of this fairness is to be made by businessmen alone--it is their money that they are investing. }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     These are the three fronts on which to act aggressively if we are to create a sophisticated counter-force to the rising despotism.  One of my own first actions on leaving the post of Secretary of the Treasury was to accept the job of president of the John N. [sic] Olin Foundation, whose }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *277}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  purpose is to support those individuals and institutions who are working to strengthen the free enterprise system. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B521}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B521}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F521 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN521]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  Thus, Simon, with the support of the Olin Foundation, was trying to alter the playing field on which academic debate takes place--and trying to do so situationally.  Furthermore, he understood that the dispositionism of law and economics is pro-business and that many alternative views, otherwise successful in the marketplace of ideas, are not.  Simon presented American individualism, much as ad agencies presented the Marlboro Man, as the American tradition and the source of America's greatness.  However, like the Marlboro Man's creators, Simon seemed to appreciate that such individualism, to be embraced as deeply as }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber166}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber166}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 Philip Morris, Simon, and others desired, had to be heavily promoted, and reinforced if it is to be widely accepted.  And he further understood that the situation can and should be manipulated by, among other things, choosing particular academics, programs, and scholarly camps to give "grants, grants, and more grants in exchange for books, books, and more books." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B522}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B522}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F522 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN522]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  In light of Simon's (and thus the Olin Foundation's) pro-business mission, there is good reason to believe that the Olin Foundation's sizeable law and economics investment was money well spent.  The point is strengthened when one considers that the Foundation engaged in a kind of "stage financing" of these programs: grants were intended to last for only a few years, at which point the Foundation would consider whether to renew its contribution to a particular program. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B523}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B523}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F523 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN523]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The fact that the Foundation }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *278}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  continued to renew many grants provides strong evidence that it believed that its investments were generating worthwhile returns in terms of encouraging pro-commercial worldviews (and discouraging alternatives) among students, academics, and policymakers. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B524}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B524}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F524 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN524]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  b. Re-imagining the marketplace of ideas}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  This leads to a second general reason to suspect that Olin's investments have played a critical causal role in the success of law and economics.  As we noted at the outset of this Article, the dominance of law and economics is puzzling when one attempts to make sense of it without considering situational forces. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber167}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber167}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 Law and economics has been subject to many (largely unanswered) criticisms by extraordinarily respected legal academics, and its success seems to have surprised both its critics and some of its proponents. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B525}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B525}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F525 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN525]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   If the success of law and economics does not square easily with the idealized image of a neutral tournament of ideas, then that raises the possibility that its success reflects some largely unseen situational influences.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  To advance this argument further, we ask the reader to consider how to answer the following question: which bird, species A or species B, has been more successful in the evolutionary process of natural selection?  If you are like us, we suspect that your first thought would be to compare the relative numbers of the two birds.  With a little more time, you might decide that you would also like to know about relative sizes since at equilibrium the environment could probably sustain fewer large birds than small birds.  Controlling for habitat needs you would seem to have a simple, but fairly accurate, measurement process.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Now let us make the question a little more concrete: which bird, the bald eagle or the chicken, has been more successful in the evolutionary process of natural selection?  Shall we do the math?  There are approximately 70,000 bald eagles in North America, a }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *279}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  number that is up considerably in recent years following the bald eagle's near extinction. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B526}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B526}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F526 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN526]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   It is a little harder to know just how many chickens there are in this country at any given }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber168}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber168}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 moment, but our rough calculations put the number somewhere between 1.75 and 2 billion. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B527}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B527}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F527 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN527]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   That means that for every bald eagle there are twenty to thirty thousand chickens.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Even discounting the figure slightly to take into account the eagle's larger size and habitat requirements, the numbers are clear: the standard farm chicken is the bald eagle's evolutionary superior.  But that finding seems absurd.  We know the bald eagle as our national bird, a symbol of strength and power.  Eagles are extremely well adapted for survival in nature, given their superb flying, hunting, and nest-building abilities. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B528}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B528}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F528 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN528]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   For centuries, bald eagles thrived, and according to one history, they may have once numbered half a million. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B529}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B529}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F529 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN529]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  }\par

One researcher estimated an eagle nest for every mile of shore along }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *280}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  Chesapeake Bay.  They congregated on the lower Hudson, and were extremely abundant along the coast of Maine. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B530}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B530}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F530 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN530]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  So then we have missed something.  In determining that chickens are more fit than eagles to withstand nature's trials and challenges, we have ignored critical situational influences.  Why are there so many more chickens than }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber169}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber169}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 eagles?  The more obvious and correct explanation is that humans value chickens in a way that they have not valued bald eagles.}\par

  Indeed, there are robust markets in both chickens and eggs. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B531}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B531}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F531 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN531]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   According to a recent industry-sponsored survey, Americans consume, on average, eighty-one pounds of chicken per year--a figure that appears to be going up and that represents "the highest per-capita consumption of any of the major meats." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B532}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B532}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F532 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN532]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   They also consume approximately 260 eggs per year. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B533}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B533}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F533 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN533]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Unsurprisingly, market pressures ensure that there are many chickens alive at any given moment.}\par

  Well, if bald eagles are so fit, why did they nearly go extinct and why are there still so few of them?  The following history of the bald eagle helps to shed light on a different sort of situational influence on the bald eagles' stature than is imagined in any idealized, unrealistic "natural selection" script. }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     There is no single cause for the decline in the bald eagle population.  When Europeans first arrived on this continent, bald eagles were fairly common.  As the human population grew, the eagle population declined.  The food supplies for eagles decreased, because the people hunted and fished over a broad area.  Essentially, eagles and humans competed for the same food, and humans, with weapons }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *281}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  at their disposal, had the advantage.  As the human population expanded westward, the natural habitat of the eagles was }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber170}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber170}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 destroyed, leaving them fewer places to nest and hunt, which caused the population of bald eagles to decline sharply by the late 1800s. }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     By the 1930s, people became aware of the diminishing bald eagle population, and in 1940 the Bald Eagle Act was passed.  This reduced the harassment by humans, and eagle populations began to recover.  However, at the same time DDT and other pesticides began to be widely used.  Pesticides sprayed on plants were eaten by small animals, which were later consumed by birds of prey.  The DDT poison harmed both the adult birds and the eggs that they laid. . . . }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     More than 100,000 bald eagles were killed in Alaska from 1917 to 1953.  Alaskan salmon fisherm[e]n feared they were a threat to the salmon population. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B534}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B534}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F534 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN534]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  According to that history, the threat to eagles was not that they were ill-equipped to survive in nature, but that their success as a species did not appear to serve the interests of humans.  Indeed, the eagles competed with human interests, including commercial interests.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  As a result, the grand, and once ubiquitous, bald eagle was pushed toward extinction.  Meanwhile, chickens were raised in huge numbers to meet the increasing demand for their eggs and meat.  The relative success of chickens over bald eagles, then, has little to do with the survival of the fittest and a lot to do with "the survival of the tastiest" or "the survival of the }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber171}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber171}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 profittest."}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  In light of that competition among birds, look again at how legal scholars tend to measure the success of various schools of thought.  As we reviewed earlier, legal academics generally assume that they are competing in some neutral tournament wherein ideas evolve and good ideas become more prominent while bad ideas disappear. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B535}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B535}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F535 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN535]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   According to this view, the tournament benefits the outside world by generating and announcing the winning ideas, which are then relied upon to help make effective and desirable policy.  Thus, when some ideas are more commonly accepted, are attracting larger audiences and are having more influence outside of law schools, the assumption is often that those ideas, like the bald eagle, soar above their ground-bound, clucking competitors.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  But here is the problem: the competition among ideas may have much in common with the imagined competition between chickens }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *282}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  and eagles.  That is, in both contexts there appear to be very significant demand-side factors that help determine which ideas will be most prevalent and seemingly most successful.

Then, in the 1980s the field exploded into respectability and prominence--becoming a regular course in the curricula of the best law schools, a vibrant legal research style that figured in a torrent of important books and articles, a force that transformed many faculty from exclusive practitioners of traditional doctrinal research to a more social-}{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber173}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber173}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 science-oriented research, and a substantial justification for important public policy changes.

  In short, as we stated at the outset of this Article, there appears to be a blindness to situational influences over legal scholarship.  And Posner and Ulen are by no means unusual in falling subject to this fundamental attribution error.  Even the staunchest critics of law and economics rarely, if ever, consider, much less challenge, its situational advantages.}\par

  We opened this Article asking why legal economists have tended not to apply their own sort of market analysis to help them understand their success.  We posited several explanations, which we have expanded on slightly in this Section.  Before moving on, we want to emphasize that we perceive ourselves to be providing what legal economists have not: a type of economic analysis of the economic analysis of law.  The claim that legal academia is deeply captured strikes us as consonant, not only with Stigler's shallow capture theory, but also with the sort of "consumer sovereignty" arguments that inform the vast majority of legal-economic analyses.}\par

  We end this Part with several assertions.  First, the deep capture of legal academia is the result of far more situational influences than just those created by the Olin Foundation's funding efforts.  Second, the consequences of the deep capture of legal academia are many, varied, and immense.  And, third, the deep capture of legal academia is, we believe, only a small, though important, part of a much more comprehensive web of situational influence over "regulatory" institutions in this country and, increasingly, around the world. Evidence for those assertions is, again, the subject of future work.}\par

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  As we noted at the outset, however, the misbegotten attributional tendencies that we are highlighting in this Article are by no means limited to legal economists.  The dispositionism of human beings is fairly universal-- though the particular contours of its manifestation vary across cultures, groups, individuals, and situations.  The fundamental attribution error is just that--a strong tendency in all humans to see only the most salient, moving }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber177}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber177}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 features of our exteriors and interiors, like the sun moving across the sky, or our own behavior in a moment, and to attribute cause and agency to what we see.  This urge to downplay the rest is an animalian tendency.  Thus, dispositionalizing legal economists as dispositionists, while maintaining the view that the rest of us are not, would only repeat that error.  We are all, because of our shared interior situation, more or less dispositionists.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  It is important that we are not misunderstood.  The phrase "more or less" in the last sentence is key.  Our thesis is not that all of us (or that any of us) are wholly dispositionist, unable in any circumstance to recognize the possible role of the situation behind people's behavior. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B546}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B546}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F546 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN546]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Neither do we assert that all of us (or any of us) }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *286}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  are wholly situational, unable to act according to our own preferences or attitudes and entirely driven by unseen forces.

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Recognizing the significance of the situation does not imply that disposition is irrelevant.  Disposition often plays some role, and sometimes a quite important role, in people's behavior.  Indeed, even in Milgram's famous demonstration of the power of the situation, a sizeable minority (and, in some renditions, a clear majority) of subjects refused to obey the experimenter's instructions to continue the shocking. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B547}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B547}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F547 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN547]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Moreover, if situational }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber178}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber178}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 considerations are substantial, stable, and consistent enough, the dispositional assumption may become a more reliable heuristic for understanding our world. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B548}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B548}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F548 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN548]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  If dispositions can in fact play a major situation-independent role in a person's behavior, or if the "as if" dispositional assumption can sometimes be justified, then the question emerges: is the fundamental attribution error really so important in legal questions, in theory, in practice, and in social debate?  Should policymakers and policy theorists really concern themselves with it?}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  We have already begun our answer to that question in this introductory Article and will continue to do so in subsequent articles.  Our answer has numerous components, including what follows here.  The tendency to see disposition and overestimate its significance, while missing the situation or underappreciating its effect, is quite robust.  When the situation is observed, it is usually only a small, particularly salient piece of the whole. Furthermore, the way an issue is framed--as dispositional or situational--can have an immense effect on what attributions people make about behavior.  Here is }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *287}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  where deep capture comes in: the framing of an issue is one of the situational factors that can be disproportionately influenced by those with the motive and power to do so.  We have argued that those in power have significant stakes in promoting, among other things, a generally dispositionist framing of }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber179}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber179}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 an issue.  Those stakes have, indeed, led to investments attempting to influence the situation, including the production and distribution of legal-theoretic knowledge that is strongly dispositionist in orientation.  Taken together, those elements suggest that the fundamental attribution error is playing an immense and influential role in our policymakers' worldviews and in their policies.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Our thesis can thus be understood as a positive theory intended to explain our presumptions about where the threshold between disposition and situation lies and how high it stands.  When do we recognize the role of situation?  And what portion of the situation will we tend to acknowledge? Thus far, our primary focus has been on describing, understanding, and critiquing the attributional presumptions of law and economics.  Our argument has been that law and economics scholars recognize only a tiny portion--that is, just a few of the most salient features--of the situation.  We have focused primarily on that theory, in part, because of its preeminence and, in part, because we believe that its success both reflects and critically reinforces deep capture.  But our thesis has implications for legal theory and for laws and policies that seem well outside the purview of law and economics.  In fact, the ubiquity of dispositionism in our legal theories and laws likely facilitates the reception of law and economics's more formal, axiomatic rendition.}\par

So central is the concept of autonomy in the classical will theory of contract that, for Fried, it provides the very basis of moral authority for the principle of contractual obligation.  "The moral force behind contract as promise is autonomy: the }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber181}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber181}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 parties are bound to their contract because they have chosen to be." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B553}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B553}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F553 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN553]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  Fried appreciates that, to sustain this view of contracts, we must be confident that the choices embodied in contracts do, in fact, represent the expression of the individual wills of the parties involved.  How can the traditional contract theorist be certain that disposition is behind contractual decision making and not situation?  Enter the doctrine of duress. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B554}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B554}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F554 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN554]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  In his attempt to explain modern contract doctrines through his will theory, Fried insightfully acknowledges that, far from playing an outcast or ancillary role in conventional contract theory, the doctrine of duress and its }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *289}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  counterparts are central. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B555}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B555}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F555 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN555]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   According to Fried, "these doctrines perform distinct functions that are not only compatible with the concept of contract as promise but even essential to it." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B556}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B556}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F556 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN556]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Put in our terms, Fried's treatment of the doctrine of duress plays an essential part in defining the depth of his theory's dispositionism.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  It runs deep.  As he begins his discussion of duress, Fried never questions the basic dispositionist conception of the contracting agent.  Duress is only identified as something that thwarts or exploits a will that remains exogenous to the duress: }\par

Duress relates not to rationality or cognition but to freedom or volition. . . . [Contract as promise] excludes cases in which a person's assent is not voluntary.

  With such a starting point, only the most salient kinds of situations, and not necessarily the most powerful, will find their way into the doctrine of duress.  Fried acknowledges that the forced signature and the hypnotized nod are just "gross instances of involuntary apparent assent" and claims that there are, in fact, "many kinds of situations in which it does not seem right to treat a knowing act of agreement as binding because in one way or another it is felt that there was no fair choice." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B558}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B558}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F558 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN558]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   But this concession is not an "open-ended invitation[] to rearrange the understandings people have reached." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B559}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B559}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F559 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN559]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Indeed, Fried goes on to map a precise and rather closed-ended set of situations that may, consistent with the will theory of contract, be treated as constituting duress. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B560}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B560}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F560 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN560]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  Keeping close to the case law (as he must to sustain his project of both explaining and justifying modern contract law), Fried recognizes only the most salient kinds of situational impediments as creating duress.

  Fried explains that what is troubling about this case is not that there is no choice, for clearly there is: "[t]he shrewd and brave man who hands his wallet over to an armed robber makes a calculated decision." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B562}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B562}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F562 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN562]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Rather, what is at issue is the fairness of the choice. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B563}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B563}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F563 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN563]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   To fashion a principle through which to apply the doctrine of duress in more difficult cases and across the sweep of contract law requires, Fried concludes, a normative determination about what is a fair choice. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B564}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B564}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F564 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN564]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   For Fried, then, the doctrine of duress may be managed by his theory of rights: "[a] proposal is not coercive if it offers what the proponent has a right to offer or not as he chooses." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B565}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B565}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F565 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN565]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  This rights analysis generates for Fried a relatively clear view of the parameters of duress.  Because the robber has no right to threaten your life to get your money, contracts made in such situations are not enforced. But, at the other end of this spectrum, merchants have a right to offer their wares on extremely onerous terms, so contracts entered with them should be enforced.  Our present concern is not so much with showing why we disagree with this particular doctrinal conclusion, but in demonstrating the narrow dispositionist direction that the analysis has taken.  Fried began with a case in which the threatening situation was not only extremely conspicuous, but }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber184}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber184}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 where the element of choice was also clear.  In looking beyond that extreme case for a general theory of duress, Fried presumes that the same basic function of dispositional choice remains in place. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B566}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B566}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F566 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN566]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   This dispositionism blinds the theory to the enormous power of the situation.  It ignores the fact that situation shapes the very thoughts and behavior that manifest as the }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *291}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  choices Fried crowns with a dispositionist presumption.

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Fried concludes his analysis without ever moving beyond the "conundrums" raised by the most salient kinds of situational forces--that is, beyond those "bad acts" }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B567}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B567}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F567 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN567]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  that can fit within the basic dispositionist framework. In an interesting parallel with economic theorists, the closest Fried gets to taking up the situation on a broader scale is with respect to poverty--when people do not have enough money to properly manifest an otherwise dispositionally determined will. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B568}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B568}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F568 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN568]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   However, Fried, like the contract law he describes, is very hesitant to allow the doctrine of duress to play much part in ameliorating the challenges posed by that kind of situationist consideration.  Keeping the doctrine of duress from undermining "the moral status of calculated choices as embodied in bargains" is "a make-or-break challenge to the liberal economic theory of the market." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B569}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B569}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F569 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN569]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   It is a }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber185}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber185}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 threat to the regime of "free men freely contracting." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B570}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B570}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F570 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN570]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  To the extent that poverty remains a situation in need of attention, Fried offers what is also a familiar riposte, that the situation should be handled by the tax-and-transfer system, not contract.  Hence, in the end, the dispositionism that Fried begins with, and which he is so deeply committed to, not only drastically limits what kinds of situations are cognizable within the concept of }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *292}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  duress, but also what can be done with the doctrine in those situations that it does recognize.}\par

  Fried does not go much further than this with the concept of duress, and we need not go further here to make our basic point.  Conventional contract theories, of which we believe Contract as Promise is an influential and representative example, are steeped in dispositionism even in those areas that purport to be most concerned with the situation.  The lack of any critical examination of the basic dispositionist presumptions in such legal theories results in a fundamental failure to account for the role of the situation in shaping our conduct.  It marks an abdication of any realistic inquiry into the basic forces shaping our own behavior beyond what common sense and our intuitions will provide. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B571}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B571}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F571 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN571]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Behind this tendency is the fundamental attribution error, which social psychologists have shown is widespread in humanity, that we have argued is at the core of conventional economic theory, and that, as this example suggests, is also robust in more traditional legal }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber186}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber186}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 theories.}\par

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  The classical will theory of contract has been subjected to withering critique by generations now of "modern" or "post-classical" contract theorists. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B572}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B572}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F572 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN572]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The critiques, which will not be rehashed here, }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *293}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  share a common legacy in the American legal realist tradition, which provided both analytical and political reasons for doubting the classical approach.  Our purpose here is to show that although the "modern" approach begins by rejecting the will theory of contract, it continues to embrace an unwarranted, and profoundly limiting, dispositionism.  While the post-classical tradition has questioned the clarity of central concepts in classical theory, the legal realist approach has nevertheless held tightly to the basic tenets of dispositionism we have been reviewing here.  Our very limited goal in this Section is to provide further evidence that dispositionism reaches far beyond law and economics in contemporary legal theory.}\par

  We will sketch the dispositionism in modern contract theory through the work of Karl Llewellyn, specifically in his concept of "situation sense." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B573}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B573}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F573 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN573]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   We take this approach for several reasons, not only because an article that is entitled The Situation, and that makes the claims we are developing here, would be remiss not to engage the legacy of situation sense, but also because Llewellyn's work was seminal and is prototypical of the basic }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber187}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber187}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 legal realist approach.  Moreover, Llewellyn's work has been extremely influential in the post-classical contract theories and positive law that have followed his work. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B574}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B574}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F574 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN574]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     When the psychologists began to look into how people go about reaching decisions, the question they were concerned with was: how do people get to a decision at all, to any decision, when faced with a problem-situation out of life?  Roughly, they arrived at the conclusion that if it was a true problem-situation, i.e., if it was really a puzzler, then it was seldom that the actual deciding was done by way of formal and accurate deduction in the manner of formal logic.  The common process was rather one either of sudden intuition--a leap to some result that eased the tension; or else it was one of successive mental experiments as imagination developed and passed in review various possibilities until one or more turned up which had appeal. In any ordinary case a reasoned justification for the result represented a subsequent job, testing the decision against experience and against acceptability, buttressing it and making it persuasive to self and others. }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     Today all of this is so familiar and obvious as to bore, but there }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber188}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber188}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 were reasons why, four or five decades ago, it shocked our legal world. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B577}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B577}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F577 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN577]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  Llewellyn's actual account of modern contract theory, however, reveals that legal scholars have been too quickly "bore[d]" by the social scientists' challenge to conventional views about the human mind, and so have failed to truly incorporate its teachings.  To begin with, interior and exterior situations influence far more than just our ability to reason our way through "puzzlers."  Logic and deduction as the primary causal forces behind our behavior are, we now know, the exception to the rule.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  More generally, in the development of his notion of situation sense, Llewellyn was unaware of the basic lessons about the situation's unseen power, that psychology, especially social psychology, has now demonstrated. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B578}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B578}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F578 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN578]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   After opening the Common Law Tradition with a }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *295}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  recognition of the warning signs about our sense of ourselves, Llewellyn readily disregards his own cautions by the middle of his book, claiming that situation sense can clarify what psychology has left obscure: }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     The argument has been, however, that whereas about other areas of reaching tough decision the psychologists and sociologists and other experts are still groping for more than indications . . . yet in our area [of study] the clustered steadying factors combine with our traditions of craft . . . to provide the wherewithal to reasonably satisfy even the seemingly unreasonable }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber189}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber189}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 demands made upon [judges] by the men of law and by the citizens who are the law-consumers. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B579}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B579}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F579 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN579]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  Llewellyn sees the legal analysts' willingness to move ahead of the social scientists' struggles with mere "indications" about human decision making as a great advantage of modern legal theory.  This confidence is supported by his basic dispositionist presumption that human thought processes are relatively transparent, and that there is a fairly obvious causal relationship between men and women's preferences and their behaviors or choices.

  For Llewellyn, as with Fried, there is little cause for concern about  "unspottable" influences on the mind, and consequently little concern for ever-present though "unspottable" situational influences on behavior. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B581}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B581}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F581 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN581]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   In }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber190}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber190}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 this way, Llewellyn's situation sense is a rejection of }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *296}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  classical formalism to be replaced, not by social scientific inquiry, but by "common sense" realism. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B582}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B582}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F582 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN582]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  Llewellyn's confidence in the reliability of common sense situation-sensing is further boosted by his assurance that beyond those assorted pedestrian distracters of humankind, there is no reason to suspect that more venal distractions might make situation-sensing problematic.  His prose aroused to full flare, Llewellyn writes, "if you take the personnel of the appellate bench as an entirety, arranged in the familiar bell-shaped curve . . . [and] knock on that bell, there may be a bit of dullness in the ring, but it rings true." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B583}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B583}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F583 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN583]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   So it is that Llewellyn reassures himself and his readers that judges, like the rest of us, are not "unduly easy to bamboozle." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B584}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B584}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F584 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN584]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  We believe that Llewellyn's situation sense is badly underdeveloped.

When Llewellyn implores the legal analyst to "see it as it works" he is asking the analyst to follow how the type-situation has been composed by the dispositional actors that make it up.  There is no injunction in Llewellyn's method to seek and account for unseen situational influences in type-situations.  As David Charny summarizes, "[i]t is apparent that Llewellyn thought that custom was somehow expressive of the attitudes, preferences, and 'mentality' of the transactors themselves . . . ." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B589}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B589}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F589 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN589]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  This is because the situation-sensing analyst is urged to look at that which is obviously there, rather than that which may be hidden.  And what is obviously there is individual behavior, evidence ready to confirm the dispositionism of the sensor.  Thus, Llewellyn counsels that "the best safeguard against counsel's mispainting [of the situation, in an effort to manipulate the judge] lies in visualizing the hands-and-feet operations in the picture, seen as a going scheme, a working setup.

  Randall provides a typical example of the role that duress plays in reported cases in Massachusetts.  Our purpose is not to provide an exhaustive account of its application, but rather to highlight that the "picture" of duress made out by the broad strokes of the doctrine demonstrates the deep dispositionist presumptions of contract law generally.  It is presumed, for example, that in the typical case, where duress is not present, the choices represented by a contract are the product of "unfettered will." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B611}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B611}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F611 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN611]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   While this might }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber196}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber196}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 seem like a }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *302}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  high standard, the benefit of the dispositionist presumption actually makes it the routine case.  Despite Rapoza's contentions to the contrary, the Randall court concludes that the contract he entered into was in fact a manifestation of his "unfettered will," and refuses to find that the doctrine of duress is applicable. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B612}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B612}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F612 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN612]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  As the law is described in Massachusetts, only the most conspicuous external sources of influence will be recognized as constituting duress.  The court cites as its only example "signing . . . at the point of a gun." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B613}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B613}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F613 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN613]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The fundamental attribution error at work here sharply limits the range of relevant situations to only those that can be narrowly attributed to the vivid "bad act" of another individual.  The court's explication also reveals a miserly view of what kind of internal situation will be permitted to implicate the doctrine of duress.  Only the most palpable kind of internal situation will be seen as evidencing duress--fear.  As we have described, there are certainly many other features of our internal situations that can exercise as much influence over our conduct as does the more palpable situation of fear, yet those remain hidden by our dispositionism and are unseen in the law. Restricted by this dispositionist framework, the common law of contract has not developed categories of influence beyond salient external threats and internal fears through which parties can formulate their claims.  Unless a choice can be shown to have been arbitrary, it is presumed to be the expression of an }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber197}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber197}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 unfettered will.  With the presumption set so high, parties can strive only to drum up those aspects of their situations that catch the dispositionist eye. Against the situational threshold of a gun to the head, harassing phone calls and anti-depressant drugs will easily fail to rebut the strong presumption of unfettered will.}\par

  Contract law, like many areas of law, recognizes a point where the situation is seen to be so significant that it renders unreliable the dispositionist assumptions that would otherwise govern.  Making someone liable for outcomes over which she wielded comparatively little dispositional control and where her situation is relatively controlling would be unjust, unfair, or inefficient, depending on the theoretical focus.  If, as we hypothesize, the threshold in the law is fundamentally misplaced, then the law in many of these areas may be fundamentally unjust, unfair, or inefficient.  Put differently, if the }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *303}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  situation was as profoundly recognized in our laws as it is influential in our lives, the role of the situation would be presumptively paramount, rather than presumptively irrelevant. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B614}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B614}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F614 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN614]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  There are other places to look to try to assess the significance of dispositionism.

Although we will postpone defending that claim, it may be illuminating to highlight one particularly revealing and tragic example from our history: slavery.  We have chosen that social policy issue to spotlight because we have suggested in this Article that power--even oppressive, totalitarian power--can be exercised through the unseen situation, in part, through the creation and promotion of dispositionist worldviews.  Because slavery provides one of the most salient uses of power in United States history, demonstrating the role of dispositionism in enabling that oppression provides especially compelling evidence for our claim.}\par

  But an interesting issue emerges--one that has received comparatively little attention--about a different situational factor: that is, the teacher's perception of the learner's dispositions.  The learner was one of Milgram's confederates, but he was assigned his position as learner by an apparently (but not actually) random process.  The teacher then observed the learner voluntarily agreeing to be strapped into the chair, understanding that he would be shocked. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B618}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B618}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F618 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN618]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The fact that subjects in Milgram's study appeared to make a free choice to enter into a "contract" may be central to understanding the large number of teachers who administered the maximum shock level of 450 volts. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B619}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B619}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F619 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN619]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

I have often sung to drown my sorrow, but seldom to express my happiness.  Crying for joy, and singing for joy, were alike uncommon to me while in the jaws of slavery.

  A review of Jefferson's justifications highlights the source and destination of our dispositionist tendencies.  When we miss or downplay the situation, and see or exaggerate dispositions, we miss the hurdles, holes, quicksand, and other obstacles that can influence the outcome of any race, and instead attribute the outcomes to the racers themselves.  Given the existence of the fundamental attribution error, it is very hard for us not to assume that we are all competing on a level playing field, that the victor deserves the spoils and the losers deserve their fate.  And it is not just individuals that are engaged in a dispositional race.  Indeed, entire "races" are competing against each other.  The fact that one group dominates another often carries its own justification.  Superior races, as measured by their ability to dominate, should dominate, as nature appears to reveal. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B674}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B674}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F674 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN674]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   As Alabama physician Josiah Nott put it in 1854, }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *318}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  shortly before the Dred Scott decision: }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B675}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B675}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F675 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN675]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   "Nations and races, like individuals, have each an especial destiny: some are born to rule, and others to be ruled. . . .

Such a class you must have, or you would not have that other class which leads progress, civilization, and refinement.  It constitutes the very mudsill of society and of political government. . . . Fortunately for the South, she has found a race adapted to that purpose at her hand.  A race inferior to her own, but eminently qualified in temper, in vigor, in docility, in capacity to stand the climate, to answer all her purposes.

  In addition to those dispositionist rationales, defenders of the status quo of slavery also pointed to threats of bogeymen lurking in any change to the situation.  Change was frightening, and could be made to seem even more so, not only to slaveholders, but to lower classes as well, including non-slaveholding planters and poor white laborers.  Each of these groups viewed the maintenance of the social system as essential to keeping their fears from becoming reality.  As historian James McPherson puts it, "[slaveholders] managed to }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *322}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  convince most non-slaveholding whites in the South (two-thirds of the white population there) that emancipation would produce economic ruin, social chaos, and racial war." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B682}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B682}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F682 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN682]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  Even those that perhaps philosophically favored emancipation feared that, if blacks were released, hell might break loose.  For instance, in a particularly grave rendition of this concern, Thomas Jefferson predicted that }\par

As historian Eugene Genovese notes, "[t]he proslavery theorists never tired of proclaiming that the greatness of ancient Egypt, Israel, Greece, and Rome had been based on slavery . . . ." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B684}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B684}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F684 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN684]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The defenders of slavery assumed that there could not be a great and prosperous society without slavery; they were unable to imagine something that differed from the status quo.  The only way to be prosperous, they believed, was the "proven" way, and thinking about alternatives was a dangerous endeavor.  Of course, the views that blacks were inferior, that a successful society depended on the social system of slavery, and that only chaos would ensue from changing it, were wrong.}\par

  But the fear-mongering served an important purpose for those who engaged in it beyond simply predicting hypothetical future outcomes.  As we have hinted throughout this Article and as we will describe in more detail in other work, }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B685}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B685}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F685 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN685]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  there is considerable and growing social psychological research indicating that the presence of a threat to existing systems activates in us a general motive to justify or legitimate the system, as is. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B686}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B686}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F686 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN686]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   That research further reveals that one of the most effective means of legitimating the system is to dispositionalize those groups that might otherwise be seen as unjustly victimized.

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   We have thus far explored several ways in which knowledge structures evolved to justify the institution of slavery on behalf of those who sought to legitimize it.  More specifically, we have emphasized how slaves--and all identity groups for that matter--were more or less dispositionalized in order to "make sense" of the systems of slavery, and to inoculate them with the "patina of consent." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B687}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B687}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F687 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN687]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   But the deep capture of "knowledge" is not accomplished without the deep capture of knowledge production, and that is also part of the unseen situation.  As was true during Galileo's struggles with the Catholic Church, as Stigler argued was true four decades ago of administrative regulators, and as we hypothesize is generally true today, conceptions of ourselves, others, and our institutions do not just emerge from bottom-up, individual analyses of the given facts.  Nor do they emerge from a fair tournament of ideas, in which the most meritorious ideas, beliefs, and knowledge structures win out.  Instead, the winners are created, promoted, subsidized, and protected by the systems, institutions, and individuals who }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber219}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber219}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 enjoy the greatest power to define the situation.  Influencing the interior situation means influencing, among other things, the information people have access to, how it is framed, and its credibility.  The success of pro-slavery dispositionism required that dynamic. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B688}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B688}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F688 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN688]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  In this subsection, we focus briefly on one of its many elements: dealing with competing ideas and criticisms of abolitionists.  Here was the problem.  Although dispositionalizing slaves helped many Southerners ease the dissonance they felt from not permitting the self-evident natural rights that they were preaching, it did not relieve the dissonance created by the emerging abolition movement.  Particularly after the Nat Turner rebellion in 1831, those who justified and endorsed slavery had to explain why so many other people were not persuaded by the force of their seemingly air-tight arguments.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  The dissonance was likely significant.  According to social psychologists, when such a conflict grows strong, something usually has to }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *325}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  give. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B689}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B689}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F689 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN689]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Of course, a person could reconsider and alter her own views, but that is a rare event, particularly when there is a lot at stake, as there was on the issue of slavery.  Research shows that an extremely common means of extinguishing that sort of interpersonal or intergroup dissonance is to attribute the gap between our outlook and someone else's to a lack of objectivity on their part.  We assume that there is some dispositional source of their bias--stupidity, or laziness, or corruption, or self-interest. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber220}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber220}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B690}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B690}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F690 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN690]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Again, dispositionism saves the day.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  And that is largely what happened in the South.  To defend slavery and the entire worldview on which it was based, slavery's proponents dismissed abolitionists and their ilk as ignorant, hypocritical, and jealous of the success achieved in the South.  As historian James McPherson summarizes: }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     [Slavery] also established the foundation for an upper class of gentlemen to cultivate the arts, literature, hospitality, and public service.  It created a far superior society to that of the "vulgar, contemptible, counter-jumping" Yankees. . . . "Instead of an evil," said John C.

  d. Our dispositionalization of slavery}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  In just that way, today, we look back with horror at slavery and the institutions, customs, laws, and mindsets that made it possible.  We express outrage that "those people" could have embraced such inappropriate dispositionist assumptions, when it is so clear, in hindsight, that those assumptions were not only wrong, but self-serving mechanisms of oppression.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  The same central lessons of the Galileo story are all evident here.  We retrospectively witness powerful groups abusing their power by creating and enforcing oppressive laws based on false, but self-serving, dispositionist attributions.  As with the Galileo story, we manage to dispositionalize the people involved as "evil"--and obviously different from us.  Yet, we are nonetheless confident that history is not repeating itself today, confident that we are not blinded too by some false dispositionism, confident that we are not also unduly missing the situation.  In the examples of Galileo and American slavery we can, in hindsight, see situation as palpably as we can see a gun to }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber222}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber222}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 the head.  And such a visible form of influence is, we all agree, unacceptable.  Because we can see the situation in retrospect, we can take comfort in the belief that we are not subject to anything similar and that, unlike those who advanced or participated in those oppressive practices or "bad acts," we are dispositionally "good."}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  But here is the rub.  Those are precisely the same dispositionist assumptions that the groups who we see as "bad" made about themselves.  They did not see oppressive power shaping their society.  We suspect further that we take comfort in our own outrage at these obvious evils of the past, comfort that helps convince us that we must not be missing anything like it in our own situation. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B694}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B694}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F694 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN694]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The problem is }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *327}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  that we do not understand that the best defense against such patterns comes less from identifying flawed ideas than it does from identifying the flaws in those who construct the ideas.  The problem is in the human animal and our faith that we are immune to that which we generally neither see nor understand: the situation.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Indeed, instead of assuming that our current views about slavery and Galileo's imprisonment provide evidence that we will not again make such horrific errors, a more reasonable inference would be that those examples, and the countless others like them, constitute a compelling indication that history will continue to repeat--precisely because we do not appear to know what is moving it.  If humans are capable of believing that those we directly harm (be }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber223}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber223}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 they slaves, or Milgram's "learners") deserve their fate, it should be even easier to rationalize the harms imposed less directly, less saliently, and more situationally.}\par

  3. Conclusion}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  We can thus see that the power of dispositionism, and the patterns to which it gives shape, are witnessed again and again not just in social psychology's attributional experiments, nor just in the mundane basic habits of our lives, but in large and central questions of social policy and human society.  We will not pursue this exegesis further here, but the basic pattern is becoming clear.  When we see disposition and miss situation, we implicitly presume that the situation is neutral, that the playing field is stable, and that everything else is equal.  We see outcomes, then, as dispositionally deserved.  When the system is challenged or threatened, all those involved in the system have a stake in reinforcing it and, thus, reinforcing its legitimating rationalizations.}\par

  As this discussion has indicated, the institution of slavery emerged first and was justified later.  And the justifications came piecemeal as the need arose.  Jefferson's initial attempt to make sense of the institution was, at least by comparison to later efforts, quite tentative.  }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *328}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  By the middle of the nineteenth century, with the attacks on slavery growing to a feverish pitch, the institution's justifications were fully formed and robust.  And they }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber224}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber224}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 did the trick.  What had once been a "necessary evil" had been rendered a just, natural, and enviable path to civilized greatness.  And many in the South were proud of that transition.  South Carolina's Senator James H. Hammond spoke of earlier times when Southerners "'believed slavery to be an evil--weakness-- disgrace--nay a sin. . . .

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  If not before, it is usually at this point in the presentation of our ideas to friends, family, students, and colleagues that we are stopped with one or another version of "I hear what you are saying and I may even agree, but I }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber225}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber225}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 think you are going too far.  Is it not dangerous to take the situation so seriously?"}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  We suspect that many of our readers may be experiencing similar reactions, and we understand the concern.  To continue our argument, then, we think it is necessary to directly engage several versions of this kind of reaction to our claims.  We are doing so not only to try to mollify our readers' worries, but also because these common reactions harmfully narrow the boundaries of most social and political debates in our society today.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *329}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  One of our main concerns with those arguments is that they are not always what they purport to be.  In our experience, they are not offered as a concern that emerges once the power of the situation is fully recognized.  Rather, they are implication-based fears that prevent people from truly understanding the nature of our argument--that is, of the situation. Still, those responses are routine, usually as a fallback position--a final trump card.  So we will do our best in this Section to respond to commonly held intuitions, which we call situational bogeypeople--siblings of those that we encountered earlier. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B698}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B698}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F698 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN698]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   These intuitions seem to come in several varieties.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  1. The Communism Bogeyman}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  The most popular version of the challenge goes like this: }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     The playing field is level.  And, as long as everyone is starting the race }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber226}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber226}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 together, there is no reason to be concerned about the fact that there will be some winners and some losers.  That's what a fair competition is designed to do: separate winners from losers as it creates incentives to win in the process.  Equality of opportunity does not guarantee equality of outcome.  If policymakers were to begin looking to outcomes as a measure of opportunity, they would transform our free world into a communist or socialist regime.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  A major weakness of this challenge is that it is not actually a response to, as much as it is a denial of, our point.  Our claim that situational influences benefit some groups and disadvantage others is a claim that the playing field is, in ways unseen, not level and that we are all operating under the wrong presumption.  To assert that the playing field is level may, in fact, confirm our point: people do not see relevant situational influences (which would include many features of the playing field) and overattribute outcomes to dispositions.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  That basic challenge sometimes finds some reinforcement, though, by retreating to the following version of the communist bogeyman: }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     Even if the playing field is not perfectly level, it is level enough for us to attribute success or failure to the participants' dispositions.  After all, many people who appear to start with situational disadvantages outrun those who appear to begin with situational advantages--simply because they were dispositionally inclined to overcome those disadvantages. }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *330}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  This }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber227}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber227}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 response is just a more nuanced form of denial.  Acknowledging trivial unevenness on the playing field can often be a disarmingly effective means of justifying ignoring that unevenness.  Of course, it is possible that the field is only trivially uneven, but the evidence typically adduced for that claim tends to be very thin and seems to be based more on shared intuition than situational sensitivity.  We do not want to deny that Horatio Alger, and many like him, have successfully managed to turn adversity into opportunity-- or, in other words, have dispositionally chosen to overcome significant situational opposition.  Nor do we want to deny that the hope of just such an outcome is inspiring for many poor and hard-working people in our society. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B699}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B699}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F699 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN699]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   But neither do we believe that such exceptional success stories are much more than that--exceptional.  The fact that there is some movement across socioeconomic groups does not imply that situation does not immensely affect outcomes. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B700}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B700}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F700 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN700]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  First, when members of disadvantaged groups compete against advantaged groups, the situation will influence the outcome even if there are exceptions.  An extremely fast and driven runner with a brick tied to his foot may well outpace a slower, unencumbered runner.  But a class of brick-laden runners will tend to seem plodding or malingering as they fall behind their brick-free competitors.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Moreover, what may be true individually almost certainly cannot be true }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber228}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber228}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 generally.  For instance, the fact that some hard-working people manage to climb out of poverty does not mean that all could, if only they worked as hard.  The point about a competitive race is, }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *331}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  after all, to separate winners from losers.  The situation of the competition creates a meaningful limit to the number of winners.  If everyone ran as hard as Horatio Alger, the speed of the race would increase to be sure, but the number of winners and losers would not. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B701}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B701}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F701 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN701]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  In any event, the claim that policymakers should not look to outcomes to help determine if there is a problem with the playing field simply denies a major feature of our argument.  Because the playing field is part of the situation, there is little reason to be confident that we can know when it is level and fair.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Recall that nobody believed that the teachers in Milgram's experiment would shock the learners all the way up to 450 volts. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B702}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B702}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F702 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN702]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The fact that two-thirds of them did suggests that even the experts, including Milgram, misperceived the power of the situation and overestimated the role of disposition.  What social psychology and history teach us is not to trust our perceptions, but to doubt them.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Of course, claiming that we should learn from outcomes is a very different claim than "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs [.]" }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B703}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B703}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F703 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN703]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Our argument is not that we should all finish the race }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber229}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber229}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 together, but that where people finish may reveal more about the race than it reveals about the racers.  Outcomes can serve an immensely valuable evidentiary role in any serious attempt to ensure that the playing field is level.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Moreover, the deference to outcomes as a measure of the process is nothing new.  Indeed, it was Stigler who introduced that very methodology in assessing whether regulations were serving their purported goal of advancing the public interest.  This outcome-based }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *332}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  assessment, as we indicated above, is one of the most important foundational insights of conventional economic theory. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B704}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B704}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F704 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN704]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Finally, the idea that taking situation into account will somehow reduce the incentives of the situationally disadvantaged to try to win, strikes us as counterintuitive and contrary to the most basic assumptions of those who promote free competition.  If, in fact, the playing field is uneven, it seems that all competitors gain, not lose, incentive to run faster by leveling the field.  Those who are disadvantaged on the current field will be given a fair chance, and those who are advantaged will be given a meaningful challenge. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B705}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B705}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F705 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN705]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  2. The Personal-Responsibility Bogeyman}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  A second popular version of the situational bogeyman goes like this: }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1     If we begin to take situation into account, people will no longer be held personally responsible for their actions.  Criminals will be able to blame }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber230}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber230}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 almost anything they do on the fact that they had a bad situation.  "It wasn't me, it was the situation; I'm a victim of circumstances" will be heard in all the courts of the land and criminals will run free.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  We have several responses to this bogeyman.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  First, as we summarized above, the law already takes situation into account, through doctrines like duress in contract, }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B706}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B706}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F706 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN706]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  necessity in trespass, and "heat of passion" }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B707}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B707}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F707 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN707]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  in criminal law. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B708}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B708}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F708 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN708]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The problem, as we see it, is that the situation is far from being an occasional, glaringly obvious gun to the head, as the current law treats it.  It is a }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *333}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  force of greater or lesser magnitude in nearly every human interaction.  When we argue that the law must take situation into account, we are asking the law to continue to function as it always has, but in a way that gives the situation the weight that social science demonstrates it possesses in human affairs.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Second, there is a strong element of stereotype in the account of this bogeyman.  The stereotype is that the situational character--our model of the human animal--is a puppet on the strings of the situation, entirely lacking in disposition or volition.  But this is a false picture of our model.  We fully agree that humans possess dispositions and that dispositions likely play some role in a great portion of our behavior.  But, as we argue above, current legal theory and the law overestimate the point at which disposition ends and the situation begins.  No one wants criminals to run free, but at the same time, we }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber231}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber231}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 do not want to lay blame where it is not due.  A law that takes a nuanced view of the roles of situation and disposition will be better able to correctly assign dispositional responsibility and blame where they belong.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Nevertheless, it might seem that, if the law were to expand its acknowledgement of situational factors, the result would be to expand the avenues for evading responsibility.  Far from it.  As we have shown, people systematically--and often quite erroneously--attribute causation, responsibility, and blame to the most visible actors in a given situation. They compound their mistakes through the fundamental attribution error, by assuming that action is attributable to disposition, rather than situation. Judges, juries, and legislators are as vulnerable to these cognitive biases as anyone else.  If we are truly committed to the principle of personal responsibility, then we should be deeply troubled by the prospect that we are applying it without taking these biases into account.  For the damages to fit the tort or the punishment to fit the crime, we must first be sensitive to the situation.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  It is our contention that, by ignoring situation, we may be ignoring the true role of disposition and letting those actors who are most responsible for the harms we seek to redress off the hook.  To better illustrate this point, we offer a thought experiment, a variation on an actual experiment. Imagine an alternate world in which Stanley Milgram is actually interested in }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber232}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber232}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 studying the effects of negative reinforcement on learning.  Having seen the power of the situation, he designs an experiment identical in every respect to the actual one, with one difference: the learner receives real electric }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *334}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  shocks.  Unfortunately, when Milgram runs these experiments, the learner receives third-degree burns and sues for damages.  Who should be held responsible?}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Under commonly held notions of "personal responsibility," some might blame the learner.  He was an adult and ought to have known what he was getting into.  After all, everyone knows that electricity is hot!  Therefore, he should be made to deal with the consequences of his decision, instead of looking to blame others for them.  Some people, also citing "personal responsibility," might blame the teacher who flipped the switches because she had many opportunities to stop.  There were teachers who refused to go along with the experiment when they saw the learner's suffering; no one held a gun to this teacher's head.  Shouldn't she be responsible for the (quite visible) consequences of her actions?}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  A typical "personal responsibility" view of this lawsuit would likely stop at that analysis in either allowing the loss or imposing liability.  But what of Stanley Milgram?  Shouldn't he have known of the risks to the learner? Shouldn't he be held "personally responsible" for setting up a situation in which the teacher was quite likely to flip the switches?  Or perhaps Yale }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber233}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber233}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 University should be held responsible for not better monitoring Milgram. Milgram apparently conducted his original experiments with the university's knowledge and may have been motivated by the university's tenure standards to perform this sort of research.  Doesn't Yale profit, even to this day, from the attention garnered by Milgram's work?}\par

  No contingent of bogeypeople would be complete without the paternalism bogeyman.  Unlike the prior bogeypeople, the figure of paternalism appears more prominently and openly in legal theoretic discourse.  Although its precise definition often remains shrouded in mystery, that has not stopped it from exercising a powerful influence in legal-theoretic debate. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B716}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B716}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F716 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN716]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  Generations of theorists have agreed that paternalism is no friend of the dispositional human actor presiding at the core of the traditional liberal picture.  John Stuart Mill, who early laid down the line against paternalism in a "civilized" society, stated that, "the only purpose for which power can be }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber235}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber235}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.

  The problem, of course, is that the prevailing community standards reflect a fundamental flaw in human attributions, a flaw that appears to be greatly encouraged and enhanced by those who can best influence our situation.  Thus, in the name of avoiding obvious (that is, paternalistic) influences on people's choices, we may be turning ourselves over to less obvious, but no less powerful, influences.  Or, put slightly differently, in the name of protecting }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber239}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber239}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 dispositionism from }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *340}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  blatant situational threats, we may be unleashing hidden, but deeply captured, situational forces that leave us feeling as though we chose our lot.}\par

  Our purpose here is not to propose or defend a strong form of paternalism.  Indeed, we think our argument would demand a thorough reconceptualization of such conventional categories (strong-form paternalism, weak-form paternalism, self-paternalism, and so on) before such a discussion could be fruitful.  What we are arguing is that the charge of paternalism, as it is typically made, is an inadequate response to the claims we have presented.  What we propose is a more realistic exploration, and acceptance, of the powerful situational influences over human behavior that go far beyond the ropes of Odysseus and the fires of the Grand Inquisitor.  When we yield in our inquiries to the paternalism bogeyman, we may be yielding to basic assumptions that are themselves contestable and the subject of powerful situational influences.  The problem of paternalism is profound, but it cannot be answered with the conventional bogeyman response.}\par

We are less interested in providing a full }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *341}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  catalogue of the beasts than we are in understanding what motivates them.  People invoking the bogeypeople often begin by claiming to concede that the situation can have an immense, unseen effect on people's conduct.  They then follow that concession with a general "so what?" or, more specifically, with the invoking of one or more of the bogeypeople to make their case that it is better to pay no more attention to the situation than people already do.  Upon closer inspection, however, this technique of responding is better seen as a disarming means of denying our basic argument about the power of the situation.  It is not surprising that our audience would tend to disbelieve our claims.  Indeed, it is to be expected--just as it is easy to understand why so many people initially found Galileo's claims to be fanciful.  Without the telescope, it was one person's claim against the obvious.}\par

  We do not believe that our arguments are immune to critique.  We strongly suspect that they are in many ways flawed.  But our worry and our experience is that they are not given a chance largely because people reject them because they are hard to see, and, more importantly, because they do not }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber241}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber241}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 want to see them.  The specter of the bogeypeople provides a mechanism for evading the situation.  Indeed, we suspect that one major reason for the success of neoclassical economics and disposition-driven theories of law is not simply that they are good for business, but also that they serve to protect us all from the disquieting possibilities that many of our basic systems are both harmful and rigged.  With that possibility in mind, it is illuminating to consider Milgram's career.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  After revealing, to his own surprise, the power of the unseen situation, Milgram's findings spawned an enormous hullabaloo.  In the words of Thomas Blass, "more than any other research in social psychology, the obedience experiments have been embroiled from the beginning in a number of controversies in which they have played a central and enriching role.  These include the ethics of research, the social psychology of the psychological experiment, and the deception versus role-playing controversy." }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B737}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B737}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F737 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN737]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   It seems likely that much of the criticism found its source in the threat that Milgram's results posed to the notion that these systems are just.

  There is another, perhaps more telling, means of demonstrating that those who conjure the bogeypeople are, perhaps unconsciously, denying or minimizing our claim.  Consider the likely reaction to our argument if we were describing more visible, salient, and obvious forms of situational constraints.  Suppose, for example, that we were writing about antebellum slavery.  It does not seem controversial to argue, as we did, that slavery placed an immense and unjust situational constraint on slaves, or that slaves' conduct--including their singing--did not reveal dispositional consent to their fate.  We do not believe that the situational bogeypeople would be invoked in response to those claims. Nobody would accuse us of being communists for arguing that the situation of slaves should be taken seriously or that slavery should be abolished.  There is }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber243}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber243}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 no tendency to invoke the communist bogeyman in that context because, in retrospect, the situational constraints that caused the unequal outcomes are clear.  If we truly accept the idea that the situation wields a commanding influence, then the idea of attending to that influence seems obvious and unobjectionable.}\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1 {\pard \par }
  Similarly, the personal-responsibility bogeyman remains dormant when the situation is slavery.  It should be remembered that slaves exercised some freedom under slavery: they developed their own }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *343}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  cultural patterns and practices; they found or created items of value to trade and sometimes earned money to buy things; they negotiated in various ways with their masters for, among other things, freedom upon their master's death; they plotted and executed escapes; and in some circumstances they bought their own freedom. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B741}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B741}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F741 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN741]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   So, while slaves undoubtedly operated under severe situational constraints, they were not without recourse to influence their own lives.

  Yet nobody today would claim that slaves should have taken personal responsibility for the conditions in which they lived.  Frederick Douglass, among others, bought his own freedom, and yet we do not blame those who did not for their predicament.  In such cases, the situation is obvious, and personal responsibility lies less with those enslaved by it, and more with those who }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber244}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber244}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 created it.  Placing personal responsibility on the slave is offensive.  When, on the other hand, the situation plays a significant role in the lives and conditions of those who enjoy "freedom" (here defined as "not slaves"), invocations of Horatio Alger and the personal responsibility bogeymen emerge. If we recognized the full sweep of the situational influences over our lives, we might be more hesitant with the charge of "personal responsibility," and the emergence of this bogeyman might be less automatic. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B742}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B742}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F742 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN742]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }\par

  Moreover, freeing slaves was illegal in some states and highly discouraged by social norms and conventions in all slave states. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B748}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B748}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F748 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN748]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   In that and countless other ways, the laws and the customs that slave owners lived under were highly constraining.

  As we have described, slave owners held situationally influenced "knowledge" and beliefs that also acted to reinforce the system and justify their place in it as powerful as the economic and social forces that they faced.  As we indicated above, a freed slave was, by some accounts, unhappy.  If a freed }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber247}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber247}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 African slave could not function outside of the paternalistic protection of the "peculiar institution," or if they would almost certainly be kidnapped and sold again into slavery and perhaps down the river, or if, at best, "freedom" meant laboring in the North where the working conditions were far worse, how could a plantation owner--even a "social welfare-maximizing" plantation owner-- justify freeing his slaves?  Furthermore, if }{\f1 \fs20 \b \cf1 *346}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1  slaveowners faced the threat that without slavery their society would not prosper and evolve, then the emancipation of slaves might come at a cost to freedom. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzFN_B749}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzFN_B749}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK \\l Document1zzFN_F749 }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 [FN749]}}}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1   In short, slaves were not the only people who were subject to powerful situational influences.

  The point is that this may be the wrong question.  Suppose we were given the task of developing a means of emancipating African Americans from slavery and the many situational chains that have hindered them since.

Panelists included distinguished progressive scholars with an acute awareness of legal theoretic trends and historical sensitivity such as Christine Desan, Kent Greenfield, Janet Halley, David Kennedy, Duncan Kennedy, Mort Horwitz, Frank Michelman, and Joe Singer.  In our view, the lack of a theoretical explanation for these trends reflects an implicit (and, we think, unexamined) faith on the part of even the most institutionally and politically sensitive scholars in the academic process as basically fair and self-correcting.  One goal of this project is to provide an alternative approach to assessing legal theoretic trends.}\par

Milgram's research reflects what many, including Milgram, noticed about Nazi Germany: the ease with which situational influence can lead humans to engage in atrocious, morally reprehensible, individual acts.  Recent primary research indicates that "ordinary men"--those who previously led regular, civilized lives--overwhelmingly accepted the Nazi regime's call to genocide despite an explicitly available "choice" to evade the action.  See Christopher Browning, Ordinary Men 1-3, 55-57 (HarperPerennial 1998) (1992) (reporting how a Nazi battalion commander in World War II Poland allowed "any of the older men who did not feel up to the task" of participating in a massacre to "step out" and be given an alternative assignment); id. at 64-65 (describing how during one execution in the Polish woods "anyone who could not take it any longer could report" and be excused); id. at 74 (reporting that despite the opportunity to drop out, less then twenty percent of the Nazi policemen evaded the killing of 1500 people--an entire town).  But see id. at 65-70, 75 (relating the stories of German policemen who chose not to kill, several of whom felt no need to impress their comrades because of financial security and a lack of career military ambitions).  The author of Ordinary Men, Christopher }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber276}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber276}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 Browning, dispositionalized the massacre by focusing on those who avoided the situational influence--or responded to a less prominent situation--despite the glaring fact that so few managed to do so.}\par

There are exceptions to those basic patterns.  Most notably, when making attributions about ourselves we often are more likely to attribute the cause of bad outcomes or behavior to exterior situational influences.  For example, if we do poorly on an important test, we may be quick to complain about the distractions in the testing environment or a biased professor who grades unfairly.  Conversely, when things go well for us we have a tendency to attribute the cause to our own dispositions--our intelligence, diligence, etc.--rather than situational influences.  Those patterns in the actor-observer bias, as the phenomenon has been dubbed by social psychologists, echo part of our basic claim here, which is that our behavioral attributions are often motivated.  See Emily Pronin et al., Understanding Misunderstanding: Social Psychological Perspectives, in Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment 636, 653-65 (Thomas Gilovich et al. eds., 2002) (reviewing }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber279}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber279}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 social psychological findings concerning the actor-observer bias); see also Fiske & Taylor, supra note 20, at 72-75 (discussing actor-observer bias). Social psychologists have identified other limits to our dispositionism.  See infra text accompanying notes 411-41 (discussing cultural influences over dispositionist and situationist attributions).  Of course, even when we attribute causation to situation, we often only recognize a tiny portion of the situation.  See also infra text accompanying notes 140-45 (describing other limitations to our ability to appreciate the role of situation).}\par

But a court will not enforce the resulting contract.  The reason is not that B was not acting of his own free will.  On the contrary, he was no doubt extremely eager to accept A's offer.  The reason is that the enforcement of such offers would lower the net social product, by channeling resources into the making of threats and into efforts to protect against them. }\par

Obedience, supra note 149.  According to folk wisdom among social psychologists, that is because the subjects who went that far did not want to be shown on film doing so, presumably because they felt that their actions reflected badly on their dispositions.  In other words, it appears that even the subjects interpreted what happened in largely dispositionist terms.  As revealed in one subject's reflections one year after the experiment, subjects and their family members construed the experiment as revealing dispositionism: "As my wife said, '[y]ou can call yourself Eichmann.'  I hope I can deal more effectively with any future conflicts of values I encounter."  Milgram, Obedience to Authority, supra note 86, at 54.}\par

We are not the first to employ the term "critical realism."  In fact, legal scholars have previously formulated several variants of the phrase, though none of them have adopted quite the meaning that we intend.  Morton Horwitz, for example, used the term to denote an approach within the tradition of American legal realism that emphasized the practical political applications of legal theory.  See Morton J. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law, 1870-1960: The Crisis of Legal Orthodoxy 209-10 (1992).  Horwitz distinguishes "critical" realists from "constructive" realists, who he describes as having been more dedicated than critical realists to "subordinat[ing] political and moral passion to social science expertise" in the study of law.

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   More recently, a few contemporary scholars have adopted the term "critical realism" to describe their own approach to legal scholarship.  Ruben J.

Unknown to the students, each "litigant" presented her student-advisor with an identical problem: how best to make her case in a rent dispute.  Id.  As Hartwell recounts, "I told each student to advise the client to lie under oath that she had paid the rent.  When students asked for clarification, I uniformly responded... my advice is that, if your client wants to win her case, then you must tell her to perjure herself."  Id.  The idea was for students to feel the "pull between loyalty to authority... and prescribed ethical conduct."  Id.  Like the evaluators in Milgram's initial experiment, Hartwell predicted that the students would uniformly "reject my advice and refuse to tell their client[s] to lie."  Id.  And, like Milgram's evaluators, he was surprised to find out how wrong he was.  "Although many of the twenty-four participating students grumbled either to me or to the client about my proffered advice, twenty-three told their client to perjure herself."  Id. at 142-43. }\par

Ultimately, the experiment had to be cancelled less than a week after it began.  Id.

When economists speak of "market power," they generally use the term to refer to a firm's control of a significant share of a particular market.  Often the term is associated with monopoly practices, as when a firm enjoys such "market power" that it can reduce output and raise prices without experiencing a total loss of sales to competitors.  See, e.g., W. Kip Viscusi et al., Economics of Regulation and Antitrust 164 (3d ed. 2000) ("Generally speaking, the market power of a firm is the ability to raise price without suffering a significant decline in demand.

Cf. Hanson & Kysar, Taking Behavioralism Seriously II, supra note 251, at 1467-1553 (providing a case study of how the tobacco industry, based on shared interest, managed to manipulate consumer perceptions, preferences, and behavior in order to increase profits).  With exceptions that we will explore in future research, corporations tend to behave as if their sole--or, at least, primary--goal is to maximize profits.  See, e.g., Chen & Hanson, Illusion of Law I, supra note 84.  That is true not because corporations have dispositions, but because of a confluence of stable and significant situational factors. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber314}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber314}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 Most importantly, firms participate in a number of market competitions--for products, for capital, for managers, for labor, and for acquisitions of firms themselves.  All of these markets work to winnow out those firms and managers that do not effectively profit maximize.  Firms have charters and bylaws, situational restraints that typically set profit-maximization as the firm's stated goal, and they operate within a legal environment that places, according to most corporate law scholars, fiduciary duties on managers to maximize profit. }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Moreover, the situational characters who work within firms face strong cultural norms to maximize profits and are given extensive training in business schools or by the firms themselves.  The American business culture promotes the idea that "business is business" and considerations other than profit are irrelevant to decisions.  For a history of the basic scripts of business and corporate, see id.  Together, these and other situational forces push firms (and the situational characters who occupy them) to behave "as if" maximizing profit.  Of course, those situational forces are limited, and corporations and their managers do not always behave in profit-maximizing ways.  Still, most scholars agree that, at least in the long run, the situational imperatives of profit and the dispositions and situations of corporate managers combine to push corporations firmly towards profit-maximizing conduct.  It bears noting that our interpretation of firms as situationally motivated, at least in the }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber315}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber315}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 long run, to behave as if they are profit-maximizing is conventional among corporate law scholars.  See id.; Henry Hansmann, The Ownership of Enterprise 23 (1996) (explaining why it is reasonable to assume that firms will, over time, tend toward profit-maximizing, or cost-minimizing, practices); cf.

At the same time, it is important to note that the Catholic Church was not an institution that inherently spurned logic and empirical study.

Traditional science and philosophy were rooted in the insights of the Bible and the work of Ancient Greek thinkers (notably Aristotle).  Scholars were to approach such authorities, not as advocates of debatable propositions, but as bodies of revealed truth from whom added insights could then be gained via the process of deductive reasoning.

See Redondi, supra note 287, at 52-53 (describing the intricate process of deciphering The Assayer). In doing so, Galileo saw himself as a kind of "philosopher of nature," whose work was every bit as important to the project of understanding Creation as that of the moralist or the theologian.

Aristotle originally proposed that all celestial bodies were immutable perfect spheres, the Earth being fixed at the center.  See Sobel, supra note 290, at 170-71 (describing the geocentric Aristotelian world view in contrast to the views of Salviati, Galileo and others).  Ptolemy reasoned that this must be so, since "if the [E]arth were not at the center of the stellar sphere, we should not be able to always see half of this sphere; but we do see it...."  Galileo's Reply to Ignoli (1624), in The Galileo Affair, supra note 234, at 154, 168.  When one looks at two fixed stars opposite each other, such that one rises when the other sets, this shows that the part of the sky above the Earth is equal to the part below, and consequently that each is a hemisphere, and, since this phenomenon is observable for all horizons, that the }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber327}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber327}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 Earth is at its center.  See id. at 168-69 (explaining the basis for Ptolemy's reasoning).  Galileo called the argument "beautiful and worthy of Ptolemy" but pointed to the (now obvious) alternative explanation that "if we let this sphere be still and let the terrestrial globe turn on itself (as Copernicus does), then regardless of where it is placed the same thing will happen to the two fixed stars, namely their simultaneous rising and setting."

Of course, Galileo's theory was more complicated than the geocentric view and consequently left many questions unanswered.  Among other problems, a heliocentric Earth, without gravity (a concept which was unavailable at the time) could neither rotate nor revolve without sending its occupants flying.  The fact that most of the Earth's objects seemed fairly secure (with the exception of the tower in Pisa) was a major reason that he }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber328}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber328}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 (incorrectly) turned to the tides for support of his view.

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Legal economists justify eschewing realism in the name of maintaining a theory that is falsifiable.  As the Galileo story indicates, however, there are major problems with that justification.  First, there is no reason to believe that the more realistic a model, the less falsifiable it is.  That much is clear from Posner's own example of the debate between Galileo and Bellarmine. See supra text accompanying note 230.  Bellarmine's theory was clearly neither realistic nor falsifiable.  Second, even if more realistic theories are less falsifiable, that fact does not justify ignoring reality.  Absent a meta-rule explaining how realism and falsifiability are to be traded off (again, assuming that there is such a tradeoff), identifying the problem does not identify how the tradeoff should be resolved.  Thus, Posner's claim seems to be a makeweight argument against realism.  Furthermore, if Posner's position is that his theory is superior because it is falsifiable, then he needs to acknowledge that it has, indeed, been thoroughly falsified (or been rendered, by his defenses, non-falsifiable).  As we discuss elsewhere, many previous economic theories have been falsified, including those that resemble the simplistic models of law and economics.  See Hanson & Yosifon, supra note 30 (discussing biology's theory of "spontaneous generation" and economists' theories of intertemporal choice, }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber329}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber329}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 revealed preference, and assumptions of "perfect information" and "stable preferences" have been more or less falsified."); Hanson et al., supra note 84 (arguing that Posner's positive theory of tort law has been falsified or is non-falsifiable, and provides an alternative positive theory of tort law).}\par

Instead of pursuing the analytic inquiry that this increasingly non-falsifiable definition of self-interest would entail, scholars relying on it typically just move on, leaving the dispositionist rational actor whole and ready to be employed for the next analysis.  A critical realist approach places the exploration of the nature of preference formation, and the location of its influences, at the start of an analytic inquiry, instead of avoiding it as an unfortunate impasse to simple, if unrealistic, analyses and seemingly clear policy conclusions.}\par

The battle was not played out merely in the minds of Europeans-- great armies also were clashing on European soil.  On the eve of Galileo's trial, the Thirty Years War (1618-1648) was going extremely badly for the Catholic side.  In 1632, the Protestant King of Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus, broke through the armies of the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor in Germany and advanced on Italy.  He probably would have crossed the Alps and marched on Rome itself but for his own untimely death that same year.  See id. at 231.  It }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber343}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber343}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 was at this time, in February of 1632, that Galileo published The Dialogue, in which he called into question the entire framework of Aristotelian cosmology advanced by the Church.  See De Santillana, supra note 286, at 38, 186. (acknowledging dispute between Galileo and Aristotelians and citing 1632 as the date of publication).  So it was that Galileo slammed into an entire framework of intellectual, spiritual, and political power and authority that already felt itself to be under attack.  Consequently, the Pope was in no mood to be indulgent, especially since Bellarmine had forbidden Galileo to advance heliocentrism in 1616.  In response to a plea by the Tuscan ambassador for lenience, the Pope supposedly "exploded in anger," saying that in his "perverse material," Galileo had, "dared enter where he should not, into the most grave and dangerous subjects that one could possibly raise at the moment."

It may be helpful to highlight a few of the key deregulatory actions of the FCC within the past several months.

Powell, supra note 358.  Much of Powell's rhetoric is based on the }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber350}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber350}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 idea that regulations inhibit innovations that would directly benefit the public.  In defending the vote to allow airwaves license-holders to lease without prior FCC approval, Powell said, "'[o]ur decision unlocks value trapped for too many years in a regulatory box."'  David Ho, FCC Votes to Let Cell-Phone Firms Lease Airwaves, Phila. Inquirer, May 16, 2003, at C2 (quoting Powell).  He added that the decision "'will expand spectrum access for innovators and entrepreneurs, increasing the number and variety of wireless applications available to consumers."'  Id. (quoting Powell). }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Powell sees the recent move to deregulate cross-ownership rules as similarly bolstering the public interest by expanding consumer choice.  According to Powell, in situations where a corporation has received a waiver to own both a newspaper and a television station in the same city, the result has been better local news coverage.  Ahrens, FCC Plan, supra note 357, at A1.  In addition, he has suggested that network owned-and-operated television stations typically produce more local news than those not owned by networks.  Id.  In his words, it "'has become more difficult to simply assert that an ownership restriction is essential to promoting diverse viewpoints where so many outlets and owners thrive...."'  Associated Press, FCC to Vote on Media Ownership Rules, San Diego Union Trib., Mar. 28, 2003, at C2 (quoting Powell). }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Powell also justifies the cross-ownership changes by claiming they help support public-interest programming.  In his view, if cable continues to eat }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber351}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber351}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 away at broadcast, public-interest programming will be jeopardized because cable channels are under no FCC obligation to provide such programming. Ahrens, FCC Plan, supra note 357.

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Although Powell has described public-interest programming as necessary, he is uncomfortable with the FCC deciding what it should be.  "'If you're using the government will to impose "castor oil" or "eat your vegetables" programming, you'd better be a little bit concerned that you're going to allow three of five unelected officials to unduly impose what they prefer to see on TV."'

While our main emphasis in this Article is on how corporations indirectly capture the way we see and understand the world, we do not mean to suggest that corporations are not expending a great amount of energy on directly influencing regulators as well.  In anticipation of the FCC's recent decision on how Bell telephone companies lease lines to competitors, "[t]he Bells spent hundreds of millions of dollars in a furious lobbying campaign to }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber352}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber352}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 convince Congress and the FCC that they could not be expected to push broadband out into rural areas, or invest in new, advanced networks, if they were forced to then lease them to rivals."  Krim, supra note 357, at A1.  Moreover, between 1999 and 2002, the top twenty-five media companies spent $82 million on lobbying the FCC and Congress and contributed $26.7 million in individual, PAC, and soft money donations.

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   One of the main forces behind the FCC's recent decision to relax regulations that limit the cross-ownership of newspapers and television stations was Victor Miller, a media analyst at Bear Stearns.  Coincidentally, Bear Stearns has banking and underwriting relationships or has rated stocks in at least fifteen media companies directly affected by the FCC's proceedings.  Mark Wigfield, Bear Stearns Analyst Helps FCC Reshape Ownership Rules, Wall St. J., June 2, 2003, at C1.  Yet, the media ties do not appear to have resulted in Miller's advice being discounted.  According to Susan Eid, Counsel to the FCC Chairman, Miller "'is enormously helpful as you sort through the economic issues and financial issues in the industry."'  Id. (quoting Eid).  In the words of Eid, "'His analysis is rock-solid."'  Id. (quoting Eid). }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Miller's example highlights a general trend.  "Wall Street's views have become increasingly important at the FCC since the 1996 Telecommunications Act }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber353}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber353}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 began substituting market competition for regulation as the best way to ensure that the nation's airwaves are used in the public interest."  Id.  Today, the FCC appears to rely heavily on non-governmental private data for a range of critical regulatory factors such as "ownership, audience reach and cable subscribers."

Integrity, A Penchant for Secrecy: Why is the FCC So Determined to Keep Key Data from the Public?, at http:// www.openairwaves.org/telecom/report.aspx?aid=18 (May 22, 2003).  A more general reliance on corporations, analysts, and investors in policy making has led some critics to question the neutrality of the regulatory process.  Between September 2002 and June 2003, the nation's top broadcasters had over seventy face-to-face meetings with FCC officials behind closed doors.  Bob Williams, Ctr. for Pub. Integrity, Behind Closed Doors: Top Broadcasters Met 71 Times With FCC Officials, at http://www.publicintegrity.org/dtaweb/report.asp? ReportID=526&L1=10&L2=10&L3=0&L4=0&L5=0 (May 30, 2003). }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The closed-door sessions, which are officially called ex parte meetings, are allowed under FCC rules.  The meetings are not recorded, nor are the participants required to keep detailed minutes of the sessions.  Non-FCC people who participate in the meetings are supposed to file a notice of the session by the end of the following day.  The notice is supposed to include a summary of what was discussed. }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Id.  During that same period, the FCC met with two major consumer groups }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber354}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber354}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 only five times.  Id.  Faced with this heavy lobbying, even Powell has begun to question the benefits of an increasingly close relationship with interest groups: "'I do think ... that sometimes it gets out of hand.... I often think that we need time to do our work rather than hear pitches."'  Id. (quoting Powell). }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   But then as bad as "pitches" are, they may not be as troubling as the "perks" passed on to FCC employees in recent years by big business.  The Center for Public Integrity reports that companies and industry groups paid $2.8 million over the past eight years for 2,500 trips by agency officials.

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   There are still other unsettling statistics concerning the "revolving door" between industry and regulators.  For example, before coming to the FCC, Powell worked at the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers LLP, of which the GTE Corporation was a major client.  GTE later merged with Bell Atlantic to form Verizon, the largest local phone company in the United States, but Powell never recused himself from participating in deliberations or votes relating to either }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber355}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber355}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 company.

However, one wonders how well his actions comport with the spirit of that law.  Since the time Powell took office through the present, Verizon has had many regulatory issues before the FCC, relating from cell phones to the Internet. And in his role as Commissioner, Powell has often taken the pro-Verizon position, bemoaning what he sees as the harsh "interconnection and market-opening requirements" imposed on GTE and others.  Id. }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Passing through that same door, but in the opposite direction, Dorothy Attwood quit her job last year as chief of the FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau and two months later was working at SBC Communications, guiding the telecom company through the FCC policies on local telephone competition that she helped draft.

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Attwood and Powell are not anomalies.  In fact, over the last decade, several dozen FCC workers have crossed the busy threshold from regulated industry to regulator or the other way around.  Id.  Some have taken to straddling the worlds on both sides of that threshold.  Former FCC Chairman Richard Wiley is now a senior partner at the lobbying firm of Wiley, Rein & Fielding LLP.

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Not everyone is turning a blind eye to the matter.  On June 13, 2003, Senator McCain proposed a reauthorization bill that would give the FCC greater authority to regulate and limit the "revolving door" influence on the agency. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber357}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber357}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 Statement by Senator John McCain on the Federal Communications Commission Reauthorization Act of 2003 (June 13, 2003), available at http:// www.senate.gov/~commerce/newsroom/printable.cfm?id=205012.  To decrease the influence of the media industry, the bill would bar top staffers from lobbying for one year after leaving the FCC.  See id. (recounting the various elements of the reauthorization bill).  It would also bar companies and other interest groups from paying travel expenses of FCC officials for flights to nongovernment sponsored conferences, meetings, and events.  Id. }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Unfortunately, these remedies may not ultimately solve the regulatory capture dilemma because they do not go far enough.  They do not acknowledge the problem that people perceive the playing field as reasonably level even when it is not.  In the debate leading up to the recent changes in media ownership rules, former FCC Chairman Riley saw a fair tournament of ideas between consumer groups and media corporations: "[A] lot of players have gotten onto the field and are participating in the process at the commission.  So there's a lot of lobbying, pro and con."  Weiss, supra.  In his opinion: }\par

Hopefully people who know the commission process can help their clients sort through it, but... I don't think anybody rolls over because a former chairman or former commissioner comes in....

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   We do not claim that there is no competition for regulatory influence, or that all commercial interests will always agree on every regulatory policy, or that one side of the competition will always win.  There does appear to be a playing field, and, as these examples illustrate, the competition over regulatory policy can be robust.  See Stephen Labaton, F.C.C. Chief Talks of Frustration and Surprise, N.Y. Times, Sept. 22, 2003, at C1 (describing the competing interests in regulatory policy).  The existence of a competition, however, is not proof of a fair, meritocratic process, as Wiley seems to suggest.  It is still possible to predict which groups will be advantaged or disadvantaged by the playing field and the rules of the game.  And that is the stuff of shallow capture.  Furthermore, and this is a major theme of this Article, there are ways of conceptualizing human actors, markets, and }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber359}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber359}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 regulations in a way that is broadly pro-commercial.  As we have argued, the dispositionist perspective that frames the discussions and debates about regulatory policy itself tends toward pro-market and anti-regulatory policies. That is part of what we mean by deep capture. }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Consider the following metaphor: In Major League Baseball, there are thirty teams, which compete not just on the field in games, but also off the field in recruiting the best players to play for their teams.  While on-the-diamond competition is played on a level field, the off-the-field competition is not; the wealthiest teams have a huge advantage in recruiting top players because they can offer much higher salaries.  So while there is still some competition--you still have to throw strikes and score runs--off-the-field situational advantages have tremendous impacts on on-the-field outcomes.  In 1999, for example, all eight teams that made the playoffs were among the top ten highest salaried teams in the league.  Although the tenth-highest salaried team made the playoffs and the fourth-highest did not, none of the twenty lowest salaried teams made it.  In the 1999 World Series, the team with the league's highest payroll, the New York Yankees, defeated the team with the league's third-highest payroll, the Atlanta Braves.  While there is a playing field, the playing field is not level, and the situation of the playing field affects outcomes.  See Lani Canfield Fisher, October is For the Rich, 19 J.

Id. at 89.  Recognizing the differences between self-conceptions in the East and in the West has long been a theme in both anthropology and philosophy.  See Kunda, supra note 20, at 515, (noting that anthropologists have long explored cultural differences in self-perception and social }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber376}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber376}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 understanding) (citing Culture Theory: Essays on Mind, Mind Self, and Emotion (Richard A.

For a collection of Geertz's influential writings on cultural anthropology, see The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays by Clifford Geertz (1973).  More recently, social psychologists have begun to demonstrate and examine the difference.  One of their key discoveries is, as we will review in this Section, that dispositionism varies across cultures.  See generally Kunda, supra note 20, at 515-60 (comparing differences in social cognition amongst different cultures, and in particular between Easterners and Westerners).}\par

We recognize and apologize for the breadth of these categories.  To date, the distinctions by social psychologists have rarely been refined much past those of "Easterners" and "Westerners."  Still, as broad and inadequate as those two categories may be, they represent a key advance over the nearly complete lack of categories that otherwise exists in many social scientific theories and lay theories of human actors.  And that criticism, we confess, applies to much of social psychology and to virtually all of this Article, }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber377}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber377}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 which too frequently speak of "human" tendencies--as if there is just one relevant category of humans as revealed through studies of mostly college students.  This practice is particularly striking in light of the fact that, as we'll describe, the work comparing "Easterners" and "Westerners" has demonstrated significant cross-cultural differences.  See infra text accompanying notes 425-50; see also Nisbett, supra note 415, passim (providing evidence of how groups in different parts of the world not only think about different things, but actually think differently).  Future work will likely yield a more refined understanding of how we conceptualize our worlds and of how those conceptualizations reflect and influence those worlds. }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Additionally, we may find that much of the cognitive processes and emotions that social psychologists have understood as involuntary may be somewhat malleable.  That, at least, was a recurring theme at a very recent two-day conference and discussion entitled, Mind and Life XI: Investigating the Mind: Exchanges Between Buddhism and the Biobehavioral Sciences on How the Mind Works, (held at MIT, Sept. 13-14, 2003, and co-sponsored by the McGovern Institute at MIT and the Mind and Life Institute, and attended by, among others, Daniel Kahneman, Daniel Gilbert, and the Dalai Lama).

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   The problem is not just that the category "human" is too broad.  In fact, it may also be too narrow.

Other studies have yielded more specific evidence of the contours of cultural difference and how it manifests in broader outlooks and motivations. One study of American and Japanese subjects, for example, compared self-enhancement biases in Western and Eastern subjects.  Groups of American and Japanese subjects were asked to provide a list of examples of situations that they felt had enhanced their self-esteem, and others that they felt had diminished it.  See Shinobu Kitayama et al., Individual and Collective Processes in the Construction of the Self: Self-Enhancement in the United States and Self-Criticism in Japan, 72 J. Personality & Soc. Pyschol. 1245, 1249-54 (1997); see also Kunda, supra note 20, at 542-47 (summarizing Kitayama's experiments).  The researchers then took a list of four hundred responses culled from both groups and administered the list to new subjects, again comprised of American and Japanese subjects.  Id. at 544.  The subjects were asked to select the situations that they felt were applicable to themselves, and how their self-esteem had been affected by the situation. Id.  The results revealed strikingly different self-perceptions between the }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber381}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber381}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 American and Japanese subjects.  American subjects exhibited a more pronounced self-serving bias, claiming that a higher proportion of the self-enhancing situations applied to themselves than did the Japanese subjects.  So significant was that tendency among Westerners that it held true even for self-enhancing characterizations that had been provided by the earlier Japanese subjects; that is, Americans were more likely than Japanese subjects to claim that those characterizations applied to themselves.  Id. at 546-47. }\par

See supra text accompanying notes 194-95; see also Hanson & Yosifon, supra note 30.  The results of the above study, and others like it, suggest that the tendency to see oneself as interacting with the world as a stable dispositional actor is more pronounced in individuals in Western society than it is among people in the East.  Related studies, for example, demonstrate that self-enhancement biases are less prevalent in the East than in the West.

Again, the cultural disposition of individualism may well reveal more about the situation than is commonly recognized.  See supra text accompanying notes 444-49 (discussing the link between a culture's regard for individualism and that culture's tendency toward dispositionism).  "The frontier" provided to those who ventured to America a chance to change their lives--an escape in some cases, an opportunity in others.  By sailing West to get to America and then "going West" once here, the situation would have seemed far less constraining: gone were many of the shackles of religious persecution, population density, employment pressures, and rigid class norms.  Those who survived and thrived did so perceiving they had acted according to their choices.  Seemingly boundless land and natural resources, together with growing markets and changing technologies, provided many Americans with a strong perception of self-reliance and self-determination.  To a large degree, that perception held true--but largely because the situation permitted it.  In other words, the freedom that we attribute to the disposition of individuals may more accurately be the consequence of the options afforded by the situation in a }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber390}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber390}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 "land of opportunity."  Particularly when compared to the Old World--where famine, poverty, and political strife rendered the situation oppressive and salient--the New World would have felt to many people (particularly young, strong, entrepreneurial, free, and white men) as a land where disposition decided one's fate.  Again, the frontier on which the American pioneer was permitted to venture was itself a great situational source of both perceived individualism and this country's success. }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   With that commentary, we have here inadvertently stumbled into the midst of a long-standing historiographical battle.  The classic work that initiated that battle was written in the late nineteenth century by Frederick Jackson Turner. Frederick Jackson Turner, The Significance of the Frontier in American History (1893), reprinted in The Frontier in American History 1 (1920).  Turner challenged the then-conventional "germ theory" that the American character was a dispositional legacy of the Old World and emphasized instead the situational effects of the frontier in giving shape to a distinctly American disposition. In his words: }\par

See, e.g., Donald Worster, New West, True West: Interpreting the Region's History, 18 W. Hist. Q. 141, 144-46 (1987) (rejecting the process idea central to Turner's thesis, preferring instead to define the West as a fixed geographical region).  But there remains, we believe, a strong case that situation--including our interior situation, which may be motivated to see ourselves as the rugged individuals that Turner idealized--plays far more of a role in defining who we are, or like to believe we are, than we recognize.

An Olin grant helped establish Harvard Law School's Law and Economics Program in 1985. Olin Gift Expands Law and Economics at HLS, Harv. L. Bull., Summer 1998, at 30.  Further support then led to the 1995 opening of the Olin Center at Harvard Law School, "now the world leader in educating students, training academics, and promoting scholarship in law and economics."  Id.  "Among [the Olin Center's] academic offerings are three economic analysis seminars, courses on }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber402}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber402}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 the economics on regulation and antitrust, classes on law and economics and on empirical methods, and a new course, Analytical Methods for Lawyers," for which the Olin Center faculty is developing a textbook for adoption across the country.

Olin Foundation, at http:// www.law.harvard.edu/news/2003/05/19_olin.php (May 19, 2003) [hereinafter Harvard Law School Press Release].  Beyond the classroom, "[t]he Olin Center supports more than twenty John M. Olin Fellows each year to conduct research on topics ranging from corporate governance to prenuptial agreements."  Id. Much of the sponsored scholarship has involved the application of economic analysis to controversial issues, including Professor Kip Viscusi's criticism of tobacco and smoking regulation.  Id.; see also Viscusi, supra note 15, at 145 (arguing that government policy "should not be to deter smoking but to provide information concerning the variety of smoking hazards" so that consumers can make their own choice).}\par

We suspect that such financing arrangements may have had some influence over the kind of work that was produced under the auspices of each program, just as economists generally tend to assume that such financing arrangements can have incentive effects over those subject to them.

Stud. 1 (concluding that venture capital financing can affect the short-term behavior of the entrepreneur); see also Paul A.

And so it is that we treat corporations as having a set of stable preferences that they pursue systematically over time.  There is a strong and stable set of situational forces, including corporate law, regulatory law, the single maximand of profit, and the markets for products, managers, and capital.  These fairly consistent situational influences may allow for a relatively precise dispositionist perspective on corporate behavior.  See supra notes 253-54 and accompanying text (discussing how situational forces make corporations behave as if their primary goal is profit maximization).  Still, we would caution that a more realistic analysis of corporate conduct is in order, a task that is beyond the scope of this Article.}\par

The basic legal realist analytic critique of the classical approach has been the claim that fundamental doctrines in contract law are far too public, and the intent of parties far too difficult to discern, for the will theory to explain contract.  The basic political critique has been that so strongly privileging individual "will" in contract law unfairly disadvantages those without bargaining power.  Both of these critiques, while not our focus here, are consonant with our views of both classical and modern contract law. The historical and intellectual movement from "classical" to "modern" contract theory has been a subject of sustained analysis by contract theorists.  For an overview, see P.S. Atiyah, The Rise and Fall of Freedom of Contract (1979); Horwitz, supra note 200, at 33-63; Jack Beatson & Daniel Friedman, Introduction, From "Classical" to Modern Contract Law, in Good Faith and Fault in Contract Law 3 (Jack Beatson & Daniel Friedmann eds., 1995); see also Jay M. }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber417}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber417}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 Feinman, }{\field {\*\fldinst {HYPERLINK "http://www.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?rs=dfa1.0&vr=2.0&DB=3084&FindType=Y&SerialNum=0102032466" }}{\fldrslt {\f1 \fs20 \ul \cf2 Promissory Estoppel and Judicial Method, 97 Harv.

Though a precise definition of "situation sense," is notoriously absent, see supra note 573 and accompanying text, its common sense eclecticism is betrayed in Llewellyn's description of the concept as a "compound[] of Isness and Oughtness and what have you more...."  Llewellyn, supra note 575, at 61.  See also id. at 121 ("The evidence for this [i.e., that otherwise good rules can be twisted out of shape by attempts to do justice in 'hard cases'] draws on more than 'common knowledge' (which can so often be unmasked as common superstition); it draws on that most uncommon knowledge which I call horse sense, the balanced shrewdness of the expert in the art.").  As far as what goes into this compound, for Llewellyn, "the main guide is felt sense and decency."  Id. at 135.  Professor Rakoff comments that "[i]t appears that Llewellyn was in some fashion endorsing a method of practical wisdom."  Rakoff, supra note 573, at 202.  The question though is just what method guides the practice of situation sense.  Llewellyn's explanation has often been characterized as "unmethodical."  See, e.g., id. at 203 (suggesting that Llewellyn offers "many examples [but] no clear description of a method").

Llewellyn rejects attempts by critics to categorize situation sense and legal realism as a philosophy in general or as a form of positivism in particular.  Llewellyn, supra note 575, at 508-09.  For Llewellyn, situation sense is an approach to decision making that encourages the decision maker to see each situation "fresh" while positivism is a philosophy giving legitimacy to law because it is law.  See Karl N. Llewellyn, The Normative, the Legal, and the Law-Jobs: The Problem of Juristic Method, 49 Yale L.J. 1355, 1370-72 (1940); see also Horwitz, supra note 200, at 208-12 (summarizing the critique of Llewellyn's situation sense on grounds that it is positivism).  "Why should realism, which starts out as a reform movement, carry in its loins [an] essentially reactionary principle?"  Id. at 211 (quoting L.L. Fuller, }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber424}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber424}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 American Legal Realism, 82 U. Pa. L. Rev. 429, 461 (1934)). }\par 
\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   Our critique is somewhat different.  Beyond the question of whether other concerns will inform the judgment, we claim that there is too much positivism even in that component which is attempting to discern the "type-situation." Our claim is that the type-situation cannot be properly seen unless it is viewed from a critical realist perspective.  Post-classical contract theory ultimately rests on the faith that "situation sensing" provides, as Professor Rakoff puts it, "good ground" for legal decision making.  Rakoff, supra note 573, at 223; see also id. at 228 ("In short, situation-sense is a very good method for determining what the default rules of contract law should be.").

The same is true in other areas of the law.  In tort law, courts recognize the limits of property rights when salient situational conditions of "necessity" are in play.  A sudden, unexpected tempest, for instance, will mute the consequences of the otherwise dispositional act of trespass.

Some anecdotal evidence provides loose support for this account.  First, as noted above, none of the teachers ever went to find out if the learner was okay.  Supra text accompanying note 180.  It is as if the teachers felt that they were not responsible for the learner's condition--in other words, that the learner was responsible for himself.  In addition, there is some evidence that the teachers dispositionalized their own actions--blaming themselves for the bad "preference" that was "revealed" by their actions. According to lore among social psychologists, Milgram was able to include only one example of a person flipping the final switch (450 volts) in his famous documentary about the experiments, Obedience, because none of the many others who did so were willing to be shown on film.  Presumably, they did not want to be shown as "bad people."  Milgram included several after-the-fact interviews of subjects, some of which revealed how the subjects attributed their actions to their own dispositions.  See, e.g., Milgram, Obedience to Authority, supra note 86, at 54 ("As my wife said, '[y]ou can call yourself Eichmann.'  I hope I }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber431}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber431}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 can deal more effectively with any future conflicts of values I encounter."). Given that they dispositionalized their own behavior--behavior that was anything but flattering--it seems likely that they also would have partially dispositionalized the learner's behavior.  See supra note 110 (describing the heightened tendency to attribute bad outcomes suffered by others--as compared to those we suffer ourselves--to disposition).}\par

We do not mean to suggest, and would be incorrect if we did, that there was any unanimity in public opinion about slaves and slavery.  See Gossett, supra note 639, at 53 (noting that, although "[t]he Negro would have to wait a long time," eventually "impressive voices were raised in behalf of his innate intellectual and temperamental equality with the whites").  There were always dissenters, visionary thinkers, courageous social movements, and individuals of deep perception, who knew for themselves and shouted to others that slaves were suffering from a degrading and dehumanizing situation, not dispositional inferiority.  Very often these voices in the dispositional wilderness came from freed or escaped slaves themselves.  See, e.g., Douglass, supra note 638, at 1887 (remembering slaves' songs as "tones loud, long and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish."); Bullwhip Days: The Slaves Remember 41 (James Mellon ed., 1988) ("'That was all the slave thought about, then: not being a slave. Because slavery time was hell."' (quoting former slave Mary Gaffney)).  Other oral histories reveal that many slaves themselves internalized the dispositionist account of their predicament.  See generally Fed. Writers' Project, Works Progress Admin., Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews with Former Slaves (1941) (providing numerous }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber439}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber439}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 examples from among more than 2,300 first-person accounts of slavery), available at http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/snhtml/.

Jefferson is attaching himself explicitly to a particular school of }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber440}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber440}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 thought in the eighteenth century which held that Africans were in fact the same species as man, rather than some lesser species.  See, e.g., Jordan, supra note 639, at 308 (citing a debate at Harvard's 1773 commencement where one student argued that Africans were the same species as white men).  But notice how little difference it makes with respect to Jefferson's dispositionism. Whether the Africans were an inferior species or a lesser quality of human, Jefferson sees their condition as resulting from stable, internal dispositional factors, and not from the situation.  Later scholars would go further than Jefferson and claim to demonstrate that Africans were, indeed, an inferior race.  Samuel Morton, one of the best-known antebellum scientists, amassed the largest skull collection in the world in his scientific endeavor to demonstrate that racial distinctions reflected deep genetic differences.  More specifically, he applied this theory of polygeny to "prove" that Africans were inferior.  See Samuel George Morton, Crania Americana 5-7 (1839) (describing the African race as "the lowest grade of humanity"); see also Am. Philosophical Soc'y, Samuel George Morton Papers: 1819-1850, at http:// www.amphilsoc.org/library/mole/m/mortonsg.htm (last visited Oct. 30, 2003). "Morton's work met with a receptive audience in much of the United States.  Its massive empirical base was praised by the scientific elite, and his theories on human relations were endorsed avidly by pro-slavery advocates."  Id.; see also Gould, supra note 639, at 101-04 (illustrating the connections between }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber441}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber441}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 Morton's work and American slavery).  For a relatively brief history of the emergence of polygeny in America, and the role played by numerous scholars, including Morton and Harvard's Louis Agassiz, see Robert Bernasconi, Introduction to American Theories of Polygenesis, at v-xiii (Robert Bernasconi ed., 2002).  Agassiz, a renowned European scientist who came to America in 1846, had initially concluded that all humans were of one race.  Id.  But after being in America and reviewing Morton's evidence, he converted to polygeny.  Id.  Apparently, it was not just Morton's highly credible statistical analysis that influenced Agassiz.  In a letter that he wrote to his mother, Agassiz indicated that his own personal encounters with slaves were having an effect.  Because they were, by their appearance, an evidently "degraded and degenerate race," Agassiz found it difficult "to repress the feeling that they are not of the same blood as us."  Id.  For a more extended account of polygeny, see Gould, supra note 639, at 71-104 (exploring the development of polygeny throughout the nineteenth century); John S. Haller, Jr., Outcasts from Evolution: Scientific Attitudes of Racial Inferiority, 1859- 1900 passim (1971) (describing the work of numerous American scientists in the late nineteenth century who, inspired largely by Darwin's work on evolution, attempted to use science to prove what they assumed to be true: that non-white "races" were more or less inferior to the whites).}\par

This ability to see "superior" qualities in an "inferior" group helps reveal how the tendency to dispositionalize is often motivated largely by a desire to justify existing power relationships.  See infra notes 685-86.  By attributing superior physical strength and athleticism to slaves, Jefferson further naturalized the division of labor.  Some argue, quite compellingly, that the same sorts of attributions are made today, to the same effect.  See, e.g., John Hoberman, Darwin's Athletes: How Sport Has Damaged Black America and Preserved the Myth of Race 31-51 (1996) (arguing that the general success and superstardom of blacks on the athletic field have helped to justify their exclusion and inferior status elsewhere while giving the reassuring appearance of integration).}\par

See Orlando Patterson, Slavery and Social Death: A Comparative Study 180 (1982) (noting that in Ancient Rome "skilled and literate slaves came to dominate not only urban industries, but education, the arts, theater, and literature"); Thomas Wiedemann, Greek and Roman Slavery 8 (1981) (noting that Roman slaves were "entrusted with supervisory functions such as responsibility for the city accounts or weights and measures").  By contrast, in many states in the American South, especially after the Nat Turner rebellion, it was a crime to teach a slave to read or write.  See Janet Duitsman Cornelius, "When I Can Read My Title Clear": Literacy, Slavery and Religion in the Antebellum South 32-33 (1991) (describing laws in Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, Virginia, Alabama, and South Carolina prohibiting the education of slaves).}\par

For many, however, it is not just revealed by nature, but by God as well.  For example, the religious justification for slavery was also extremely popular and powerful.  See generally Fredrickson, supra note 639, at 15-49 (describing the influence of religion on the advent of racism).  The typical religious justification generally began with the claim that God recognized and sanctioned slavery in the Old Testament.  Abraham, the benevolent and powerful patriarch, held slaves himself and was therefore considered the ideal for many slaveholders.  See Eugene D. Genovese, The Slaveholders' Dilemma: Freedom and Progress in Southern Conservative Thought, 1820-1860, at 38 (1992) ("Abraham loomed as the principal Old Testament figure among the slaveholders.").  The next step in the religious argument was the assertion that God wanted Africans to become slaves.  See William John Grayson, The Hireling and Slave 36-39 (1854) ("Hence has the negro come, by God's command / For wiser teaching, to a foreign land....").  Indeed, even conceding that slavery was a harsh means, }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber446}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber446}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 proponents would argue that it was for good ends and part of a larger divine plan.  See id. at 36-37 ("And though the way be rough, the agent stern, / No other mode, can human wits discern, / No better scheme, may wealth or virtue find, / To tame and to instruct the negro mind...." (footnote omitted)); id. at 38 ("So here, though hid the end from mortal view, / Heaven's gracious purpose brings the negro too; / He comes by God's decree, not chance nor fate, / Not force, nor fraud, nor grasping schemes of State....").  God worked in mysterious ways, and mere men were not to question the motives of the Almighty.  As in Galileo's time, it was very difficult to question the teachings of various churches.  See Peter Kolchin, American Slavery: 1619-1877, at 185, 186 (1993) (describing the South as the "home of religious and social orthodoxy").  Not surprisingly, the notion that God chose Africans to be slaves found its way into the legal system as well.  See Higginbotham, supra note 639, at 14 (describing how notions of the appropriateness of slavery worked their way into court opinions).}\par

\pard \qj \fi0 \li0 \ri0 {\f1 \fs20 \cf1   It is worth pausing to emphasize our belief that the very concept of "race" is itself based mostly on a fundamental attribution error motivated by this larger motive to justify inequalities.  When groups of people appear to be doing better or worse than other groups, those experiencing and observing the difference often have a strong desire to attribute causation for it to a legitimating source.  See infra notes 685-86 and accompanying text.  Salient group characteristics, if they exist, are often seized upon to carry that weight.  Racial differences, from skin color to hair texture, fit the bill nicely.  As so often happens, though, the most salient features do not necessarily have much causal significance.  And, as many geneticists, biologists, historians, and anthropologists have argued, that appears to be the case with many of the "racial" differences that we observe.  See, e.g., Joseph L. Graves, The Emperor's New Clothes: Biological Theories of Race at the Millennium (2003) (reviewing the biological theories of "race" and the evidence that "race" has very little to no biological origins beyond those few that are sometimes evident on the surface); Audrey Smedley, Race in North America: Origin and Evolution of a Worldview 22 (1993) ("[Race] was the cultural }{\*\bkmkstart Document1zzSDUNumber448}\f1 \fs20 {\*\bkmkend Document1zzSDUNumber448}{\f1 \fs20 \cf1 invention of arbitrary meanings applied to what appeared to be natural divisions within the human species.  The meanings had social value but no intrinsic relationship to the biological diversity itself.").  For an interesting and readable on-line article on this topic, see Jonathan Marks, Scientific and Folk Ideas About Heredity, at http:// personal.uncc.edu/jmarks/interests/Baltimore.html (last visited Oct. 26, 2003) (describing the naturalizing but false racial categories that most of us have internalized and some of the effects of those categories).  Again, there is a strong tendency to miss the larger context and be fooled by the vivid particulars that stand out.  When Jefferson began his defense of slavery with the phrase "the first difference which strikes us is that of colour," he was evincing what we would call the fundamental racial attribution error.}\par

A thousand new wants assail him, and he lacks the knowledge and the energy needed to resist them.  Desires are masters against whom one must fight, and he has learned nothing but to submit and obey.

Now, are the average of negroes equal in information, in native intelligence, in prudence or providence to well-informed white children of fourteen?

The negro would be exposed to the same competition and greater temptations, with no greater ability to contend with them, with these additional difficulties.  He would be welcome nowhere; meet with thousands of enemies and no friends.  If he went North, the white laborers would kick him and cuff him, and drive him out of employment.

Perhaps a parallel argument may be useful to help make our point.  The tobacco industry for decades successfully clouded the causal connection between smoking and diseases such as lung cancer by emphasizing two key facts: many smokers do not die of lung cancer, and many non-smokers do die of lung cancer.  See Richard Kluger, Ashes to Ashes 203, 209-11 (1996) (discussing the debate over the link between smoking and lung cancer in the 1950s).  By focusing on those individuals, cigarette companies succeeded in distracting us from the fuller situation--which was that the trends in lung cancer closely tracked smoking habits, the incidence of lung cancer among smokers vastly exceeded that of non-smokers, and the amount that a person smoked correlated with her probability of contracting lung cancer.

What students and faculty often seem to forget, however, is that those efforts will do little to influence the grade distribution, which is largely determined by a curve.  What they may influence, however, is the sense of dispositional control and responsibility that students may feel for their grades.  A common complaint among second- and third-year students is that grading is, in fact, not well correlated with how much energy they put into their courses--a belief that may help explain why so many seem to reduce their efforts.}\par

Second, it is an argument that seems in direct tension with the pro-freedom assumptions that most of the people who offer it, claim to embrace.

Furthermore, McDonald's served its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas the average household cup of coffee is between 130 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit.  Id.

Bogus, supra, at 19-20; Press et al., supra, at 34.  Rebuffing Liebeck's request for $2,000, McDonald's offered $800 to close the matter.  Id.  At trial, Ms. Liebeck only sought damages based on the difference in injury between spilling 140-degree coffee and spilling 180-degree coffee.  Bogus, supra, at 20.  Furthermore, despite media coverage suggesting a "rogue verdict," the jury did not ignore Liebeck's role in the accident or absolve her of responsibility.  They found her to be twenty percent comparatively negligent and reduced the compensatory damages for medical costs and disability to $160,000 from $200,000.  Id.

Broadly speaking, virtually any human motive, we suspect, might be tapped into in order to generate a bogeyperson.  For instance, the human motive for closure, see Hanson & Yosifon, supra note 30, is often activated by those who seem unwilling to take "the situation" seriously unless its precise implications for policy and legal doctrine are made explicit.  Similarly, the motive for control, see id., is often tapped into by those who assert that situational causation is far more difficult to influence in predictable ways. (As an aside, we suspect that the combined motives for closure and control may help explain the fundamental attribution error.)}\par
