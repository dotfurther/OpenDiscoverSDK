GLADSTONE.

	AMONG the countrymen of Mr. Glad-
stone it will be long before even-minded
views can be taken of his character, his
genius, and his career. They will re-
member him as he appeared to them in
the heat of passionate conflicts, like St.
Michael in the eyes of one party, like
Apollyon in the sight of the other; and
the good and great imperfect man that
he was is little likely to be shown in
truth to either. Nor will his work be
justly measured or the spirit of his life
revealed by cold criticism from Germany
and France. More than other public
men of our time he needs to be studied
with a sympathy dispassionate but warm,
and with an interest impartially keen.
If such a study is possible anywhere, it
ought to be possible in America, and the
purpose of this article is to make the at-
tempt.
	On the side of both father and mother
Mr. Gladstone was of purely Scottish
descent: half Highland and half Low-
land, as stated by himself; half Celtic
and half Teutonic, as the significance of
the fact may be better expressed. His
remote paternal ancestors were lairds of
considerable estate, but the ancient stem
had thrown branches into trade, and the
statesman sprang from one of those.
John Gladstone, his father, began life
and commercial experience at Leith, but
removed to Liv~rpool at the age of
twenty-two, and entered, in the corn
trade, upon a career of great success.
He passed in due time to the front
rank of the merchant princes of the
rising city, and became a man of both
weight and power, as much by the force
of his character as by the measure of
his wealth. When the oracles of Liver-
pool were questioned, as they often were,
by heads of government and committees
of Parliament, on matters of fact and
policy touching finance and trade, John
Gladstone was sure to be heard. His in-
terests had passed far beyond the trade
in corn. He was a sugar-planter, with
great estates and many hundreds of
slaves, in Jamaica and Demerara; he
was an owner of ships; he had capital
in banks, and varied ventures in many
parts of the world. Nor did the pow-
erful, pushing Scotebman confine the
working of his energy to these money-
getting affairs. He was active and ag-
gressive in the politics of the day, 
conspicuous in the hottest fighting, and
continually exposed to the roughest han-
dling in local caricature and abuse. He
came to Liverpool, it is said, a Presby-
terian and a Whig. He had grown to
be a Churchman and a Tory of the stiff-
est creed. Political distinction was be-
yond the reach of such talents as he
possessed, but as one of the pillars of
the party his standing was marked, and
he received a baronetcy for reward. He
sat in Parliament twice (elected in 1818
and 1820), not for his own city, but for
more pliant boroughs at Lancaster and
Woodstock, and had little to say or do
in the great assembly, so far as can now
be seen.
	Apparently, Sir John Gladstone was</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00008" SEQ="0008" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="2">Gladstone.
a man of more force than fineness in
the qualities that marked his character.
Even seventy years ago the best of moral
fibre could not reasonably be looked for
in a British capitalist who drew profit
from the labor of slaves. If the slave-
owning of the elder Gladstone had been
only a minor incident of his undertak-
ings and kept in the background of his
life, it might claim little notice; but it
took importance from its magnitude, and
from the prominence of his opposition
to all measures in behalf of the slaves.
He maintained the discipline of the lash
on his plantations to the last, and his
great Demerara estates acquired a sinis-
ter notoriety in the abolitionist reports
of the day. At the end, when compen-
sated emancipation was decreed by the
British Parliament, he received more
than 75,000 for the slaves that had
been solely his own, besides large shares
of payment that came to him through
his partnership in other estates.
	To this thrifty and resolute Scottish
merchant of Liverpool there were born
four sons, of whom the youngest was
William Ewart, so named after one of
the fathers Scottish friends. The birth
of William Ewart Gladstone occurred on
the 29th of December, 1809. Before
he reached the age of twelve he was
sent to join two of his brothers at Eton,
and from Eton he passed to Oxford in
January, 1828, entering as a commoner
of Christ Church. He came, no doubt,
prepared by all the influences of his
home, to accept the spirit of the univer-
sity with a complete surrender to it of
heart and mind. He had been reared
in an atmosphere of political Toryism,
the rank quality of which can easily be
conceived. He was now brought into
another of like kind, but more penetrat-
ing, because of the different elements,
scholastic, ecclesiastical, and social, that
were subtly distilled into it. Oxford
was on the eve of the singular move-
ment of Church revival to which its
name was afterward given. The publi
cation of the Tracts for the Times was
not yet begun, but much of the feeling
that inspired them must have been al-
ready in the air. It is true that Mr.
Gladstone has said, in A Chapter of
Autobiography, that when he resided in
Oxford, from 1828 to 1831, no sign
of it [the Tractarian Movement] had
yet appeared; but where Newman was
preaching, where Pusey was teaching,
and where students like Henry Manning
and James Hope (the Hope-Scott of later
times) were his close companions, there
must have been currents in motion around
him that set strongly toward the chan-
nels of the agitation of 1833. At all
events, it is certain that young Glad-
stone became inspired at Oxford with a
passion of belief in and devotion to the
Church. By nature he was strongly in-
clined, it is clear, to religious feeling,
and to the attitude of mind which makes
religious faith easy. But there cannot
be a doubt that the influence of the uni-
versity turned most of his natural reli-
gious fervor into a kind of passionate
Churchmanship, which became the domi-
nant strain in his conservatism, and the
dominating force in his life for many
subsequent years. To understand this
principal and most powerful effect upon
him from Oxford is nearly to understand
Mr. Gladstone, and perhaps to obtain a
key to the most puzzling parts of his
career.
	While everything in his history has
gone to prove that he was formed by
nature for the activities and contentions
of public life, he felt at the university
so strong an impulsion toward clerical
duties that nothing but the strenuous
opposition of his father, it is said, pre-
vented his taking them up. Neverthie-
less, he prepared himself well, with the
opportunities of Oxford, for his future
parliamentary work. He was an excel-
lent student, and grounded himself broad-
ly in the learning which gave an endow-
ment of relief to his laborious years. He
made the most of the debating clubs,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00009" SEQ="0009" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="3">	Gladstone.	3

where he shone with a distinction that
opened Parliament to him almost on the
instant of his quitting the university,
from which he bore away the high hon-
ors of a double first.
	If there was a Tory in England more
petrified in his Toryism than any other,
it was the Duke of Newcastle. Down to
the middle of the year 1832 his Grace
had owned, as he conceived, the parlia-
mentary borough of Newark-upon-Trent,
dictating the votes of his tenants, and
sternly evicting them when they dared
to exhibit political opinions of their own.
But now his dictatorship in the borough
was menaced most seriously by an inter-
meddling act. The great Reform Bill
had been passed, and became law on the
7th of June, 1832, the year in which
young Mr. Gladstone finished his studies
at Christ Church. That act enlarged
the suffrage in every borough, and it
animated the independence of tenant
voters everywhere. The Duke of New-
castle might still depend upon an influ-
ence in Newark too powerful to be easily
overcome, but his past security was in
doubt. He looked about for some young
and ardent mouthpiece of the grim old
political faith, whose eloquent, persuasive
tongue might help to keep the house-
holders of Newark in line. Young Glad-
stone was found to satisfy the ducal want,
and he received an invitation to stand
against a Whig nominee at the coming
general election appointed to be held
near the end of the year. He accept-
ed the invitation without hesitancy, was
duly elected by a considerable majority
of votes, and took his seat in that first
reformed Parliament of Great Britain
which assembled on the 20th of Janu-
ary, 1833.
	Here, then, he stood, at the age of
twenty-three,  in the doorway of man-
hood, and yet on the threshold of a
political career. Doubtless it seemed a
happy fortune that opened Parliament
and public life to him so soon, but as-
suredly it was not. No man of that age,
when half the plantings of boyhood are
still unripe in him, is prepared to give
binding pledges to any party or creed;
least of all is one ready who comes fresh,
like the Gladstone lad, from a conser-
vatory culture of the Oxford sort. He
needed some years for the maturing of
his convictions as his mind matured,
and he lost freedom for that. He was
committed, bound fast to the political
dogmas of his father, of his university,
of his patron the Duke of Newcastle,
compelled to make a record on them to
which the criticising future would never
fail to point.
	Nor was this the worst. Macaulay,
in his trenchant way, has described the
malign intellectual effect of an early
cultivation of the talent for debate.
We should sooner expect, he says,
a great original work on political sci-
ence  such a work, for example, as the
Wealth of Nations  from an apotheca-
ry in a country town or from a minister
in the Hebrides than from a statesman
who, ever since he was one-and-twenty,
had been a distinguished debater in the
House of Commons. The moral mis-
chief that proceeds from the same cause
has been pointed out by Mr. Bagehot
in his essay on Peel. Neither Macaulay
nor Bagehot has overstated the hurt of
conscience and mind to which a young
politician is exposed, and especially when
he enters the arena of parliamentary de-
bate at an immature period of life. Mr.
Gladstone was thrust into those dangers
at the age of twenty-three. It is neces-
sary to remember the fact, whether we
conclude that he resisted and escaped
them, or that lie suffered by them and
bore their marks. All this came upon
him, moreover, at precisely the time
when England was undergoing an ex-
traordinary emancipation of mind. The
passing of the Reform Bill was the
breaking of a great dam. The floods
were let loose. The old bounds and
landmarks were being swept away. The,
old beaten paths of mental habit were-</PB>

being broken up. And behind it all
was no mere weather - change in the
British region of politics, but a tremen-
dous historic readjustment of equilib-
riuni in the moral atmosphere of civili-
zation, bringing everything in the po-
litical world, and many things outside
of it, into question and dispute. The
reactions from the French Revolution
were totally spent, and the re-reactions
were moving mightily on. But the young
man Gladstone, in the midst of the surge
and tempest of such a time, alive to it,
excited by it, in every fibre of his sensi-
tive being, had been chained fast by the
Duke of Newcastle to a stake in the
sands! Of course he had no conscious-
ness of his state of duress. He felt free,
when he pointed his lance in defense of
ground which he could not desert if he
would, but the duress was an unfortunate
fact.
	There was no lack of reformative
work waiting for Earl Greys Ministry
and the reformed Parliament of 1833.
Nothing seemed to exist, in Church or
State, that did not need to have wrongs,
abuses, demoralizations, stupidities, or in-
iquities reformed out of it. The govern-
ment and its mixed majority of Whigs
and Radicals did their duty with re-
solution, driving measure after measure
through the Commons, and generally
through the House of Lords, while the
Tory minority, under Peel, as valiant-
ly, but vainly, opposed. Gladstone, of
course, flinched from nothing in the op-
position. He made his record, with his
party, against a clearing out of obnox-
ious sinecures; against a restriction of
flogging in the army; against a removal
of Jewish disabilities; against reforming
the Irish Church, to diminish its oppres-
siveness; against admitting Noneonforni-
ists to the universities without a religious
test; against an inquiry into the opera-
tion of the Corn Laws; against short-
ening the seven years duration of Par-
liaments; and, most notably, perhaps,
against the immortal act whieh~emanei
pated every slave in the British colonies
on the first day of August, 1834. In
opposing this latter measure Mr. Glad-
stone made his first important speech,
taking ground, not against ultimate
emancipation, for which he expressed
an ardent desire, but against haste in
the liberation of the blacks, demanding
time for their preparation to be free.
	In view of what came after, it was
a curious record that he made in those
first two years of his parliamentary life,
and in no part more curious than in
what related to the Irish Church. That
Church was an Establishment for the
religious satisfaction of about one tenth
(then) of the people at whose cost it
was maintained. It supported twenty-
two bishops, with incomes amounting to
150,000 a year, and fourteen hundred
benefices, endowed with 600,000 a
year; in addition to which there was
levied a cess, or tax, for its benefit,
which yielded 60,000 or 70,000 more.
The Ministry proposed to reduce the bish-
oprics to twelve, to abolish the Church
cess, and to tax bishops and benefices
for the sum needed to repair churches
and meet similar needs. That Gladstone
should oppose even a measure so moder-
ate in its approach to common justice
and common sense as this was a neces-
sary consequence of the view of the
Established Church that he had taken
into his mind, and which all his opin-
ions must be forced to fit. I do not
hesitate, he said, in speaking on the
bill,   I do not hesitate to say that I
consider that Establishment to be essen-
tially sacred in its nature. As a sacred
institution, he could not consent to the
touch of a profaning hand upon it. So
long as he held that view it determined
his stand on all questions of Church
grievance in Ireland, on all issues with
Dissent in England, and on many ques-
tions besides. To loosen its hold on his
mind would be to set him intellectual-
ly free in many directions and over a
sweeping range of political thought.</PB>

	The ministerial majority in Parlia-
ment was made up of incongruous ele-
ments that could not act together long.
Parties on both sides, in fact, were in
a transitional state. There were Whigs
who found themselves brought into as-
sociation with more radicalism, or politi-
cal liberality, than they liked, and there
were Tories who had begun to sicken
of the rankness of the Toryisni of old
times. The name Tory, indeed, was
losing countenance. Mr. John Wilson
Croker, in 1831, had suggested the name
Conservative as a substitute, and the
new name was gradually expelling the
old from common use, while Liberal
was soon to obtain recognition as the
naturally opposite term. Jn a slow but
sure way, old Whigs too sharply driven
and younger Tories too sharply curbed
were getting ready, without knowing it,
for an exchange of place. Meantime,
both parties were shambling along in a
loose, undisciplined way, hard to control.
After several changes in his cabinet,
Lord Grey resigned in July, 1834, and
the Ministry was reorganized, with Lord
Melbourne at the head. But in Novem-
ber King William, who did not love the
reformers, thought matters among them
were in such a state that he might
venture to dismiss the whole Ministry,
which he did in a summary way, calling
Wellington and Peel to take the govern-
ment in hand. Peel, who was in Italy,
hastened home and assumed the lead.
Among those whom he invited to sub-
ordinate places in his administration was
Gladstone, whose great ability he had
easily discerned. He made him Under-
Secretary for War and the Colonies, but
the honor was briefly enjoyed. Parlia-
ment had been dissolved, and the coun-
try appealed to. It resented the uncon-
stitutional act of the King in throwing
out a Ministry to which the majority in
Parliament was still affording support,
and it gave its decision against him.
Peel, in a famous manifesto to his con-
stituents at Tamworth, had vainly cut

himself clear of the antique Toryism to
which the bulk of his party adhered,
proclaiming an open-minded disposition
toward many reforms in State and
Church. The Liberals were sent back
with a renewed majority in Parliament.
The stubborn Sir Robert held his ground
against them until time 8th of April,
when he had to resign, after defeat on
a question concerning the appropriation
of surplus revenues of the Irish Church.
	King William was then compelled to
receive Lord Melbourne again into the
premiership, with Lord Palmerston in
the foreign office and Lord John Russell
in the leadership of the House. The
strife of parties continued on much the
sam&#38; lines as before, with much the
same state of imperfect combination
among the elements of which the par-
ties were composed. Irish questions
were kept persistently at the front by
OConnells agitations, the great rock of
difficulty being always the Irish Church.
The Irish land question had not yet
arrived within sight. Mr. Gladstone,
who had been easily redected from
Newark, stood fast by his old beliefs.
Opposing the appointment of a commit-
tee to consider the burning question of
Church rates, he went so far in his
speech as to deny that the motive for
resistance by Dissenters to the payment
of rates for supporting a church in whose
doctrines they did not believe was a scru-
ple of conscience, entitled to be recog-
nized as such.
	On the 20th of June, 1837, the King
died, and Qneen Victoria came to the
throne. Parliament was dissolved, as
required by law, and the Melbourne
Ministry, manifestly in favor with the
young Queen, received approval at the
ensuing election from the popular vote.
But its moderate majority in the Com-
mons was far from solidity still, and
a formidable minority was led against
it by Peel, whose party controlled the
Lords. It had troubles to face in Can-
ada, in Jamaica, and in Ireland. The</PB>

difficulties beyond the Atlantic were
sharply threatening, but there was sincer-
ity in the disposition to cure their causes,
and they were dealt with in a fairly ef-
fectual way. The troubles in Ireland
were chronic, and nobody in power dared
thrust his hand down to the roots of
them. Destitution in the wretched island
had become frightful, beyond the ability
of words to describe. Instead of trying
to purge the foul system of things, which
paralyzed industry and made a starved
population inevitable, the government
framed an English-patterned poor law
for the country, to ornament it with
workhouses and to oflicialize the pauper-
ization of its people. The taking of
tithes from Roman Catholic peasants for
a Protestant priesthood produced inces-
sant rage and rioting, and the tithes
were millions in arrears. Instead of
extinguishing the intolerable wrong, as
a pestiferous relic of hateful times, the
government made provision for the con-
version of tithes into rent charges, and
paid part of the arrears to tithe-owners
from public funds. Nothing in domestic
matters was boldly or thoroughly done,
nothing strongly, nothing with agree-
inent in the ministerial ranks. Russell
could control the shaping of measures in
Parliament not much more than Peel.
The strength of the latter grew, while
that of the former was weakened, and at
last, in May, 1839, the Ministry, in dis-
gust with the situation, resigned. Then
came the queer incident of the Bed-
chamber question. Peel, called to take
the government, feared the disturbing in-
fluence of the Whig ladies who surround-
ed the Queen, and asked permission to
make some changes in the household of
her Majesty. The Queen refused con-
sent, and Sir Robert withdrew from his
undertaking. Lord Melbourne and his
associates, with sore unwillingness, but
gallantly, resumed the burdens of office,
and struggled on for two years more,
until the spring of 1841. Then a vote
of want of confidence was carried against
them, and they went to the country with
a new appeal. This time they lost the
verdict of the elections, and Peel came
down to Parliament with a strong major.
ity at his back. Again, and now quite
as a matter of course, Newark and the
Duke of Newcastle returned Mr. Glad-
stone to his seat.
	The epoch of the Ministry organized
under Peel in 1841 proved to be one
of lasting importance in English history.
The government had great problems to
deal with, great difficulties to encounter,
and its dependence was upon a party
incapable of comprehending a problem
or recognizing a difficulty when it rose.
But the abilities and qualities of Peel
were singularly fitted to the situation in
which he found himself placed. For
some time past he had been shaping his
mind to the acceptance of changes in
public policy from which there was no
escape. It was an open and an honest
mind, with great power in the practical
application of principle to circumstance,
but with no originality and no imagina-
tive warmth. He got light on new ques-
tions in a very slow mode. He was no dis-
coverer of the inward truths in politics,
and was late in seeing them, after other
open-minded men had found them and
shown them to the world. But when the
revelation did reach him, he received it
in a fearlessly honest way. He had no
weak carefulness for his own consistency.
Again and again in his career he yielded
himself to conversions which the small-
minded have sneered at, which the im-
penetrable-minded have called treacher-
ous, but which candid minds must great-
ly admire. We may doubt whether any
other character in statesmanship could
have been so useful to England as was
that of Peel, during the period of ex-
traordinary change in which he served
it. With the remarkable hold that he
had on the Tory party, through its utter
inability to do anything in Parliament
without him, his deep and strong con-
servatism on one side, and his slow but</PB>

intrepid open-mindedness on the other,
would seem to have had an equally great
part to play in accomplishing reforms
for the time without too much haste.
	To serve under such a leader as Sir
Robert Peel was one of the fortunate
happenings of Gladstones life. His,
too, was a conscientious mind. We may
sometimes have to doubt an equal direct-
ness in its working, as compared with
the inflexible candor of Peel; but the
desire for right was controlling in both.
Gladstone was intellectually more alert,
and he possessed an imagination that
was lacking in his chief. In tempera-
ment he was a far more impressionable
man, and much more disposed by his
nature to become responsive to the ex-
panding and liberalizing tendencies of
his age. That natural disposition in him
was still oppressed by one tyrannical pre-
possession of mind; but its liberation
approached, and the younger and the
elder statesman were soon attuned to a
harmony of co6peration which developed
the best powers of the one as much as it
assisted the work of the other.
	The intensity of belief in a divine com-
mission of the Established Church with
which Gladstone left Oxford had been
deepened, if possible, by the influence
of his Tractarian friends. He had not
enlisted with them in their movement
by any public act, but his sympathy was
understood. In 1838 he satisfied his de-
votion to the national establishment of
religion by an independent offering to-
ward the exaltation of it, in his book on
The State in its Relations to the Church.
The book would have been forgotten
long ago, if Macaulay had not immor-
talized it by a review, and if the politi-
cal enemies of the author had not found
satisfaction so often in recalling its doc-
trines to mind. It was written to de-
mnonstrate that the propagation of re-
ligious truth is one of the chief ends of
government; assuming, of course, that
religions truth is embodied purely in
the doctrines and teachings of the Eng
lish Church. Wide interest was ex-
cited by the work when it appeared, and
no little approval was given to it; but
more disapproval, apparently, and much
criticism that was sharp. It offended
all evangelical opinion, whether in the
Church or out of it, while its ground of
argument was unsatisfactory to the Trac-
tarian party, whose faith in the Aiiglican
Church depended wholly on the evidence
to be found of its true descent from the
primitive Church. A defense of the
Establishment on semi-political lines re-
ceived no warm welcome at their hands.
In the political world it was coldly dis-
cussed, as something likely to damage
the prospects of the writer, and Peel,
especially, is reported to have dismissed
it with an impatient remark.
	But whatever the effect of the book
on Mr. Gladstones reputation, he un-
doubtedly was yet, in 1841, as Macau-
lay had described him in 1839, the
rising hope of those stern and unbend-
ing Tories, who follow, reluctantly and
mutinously, a leader whose experience
and eloquence are indispensable to them,
but whose cautious temper and moder-
ate opinions they abhor. Peel can
have had no jealousy of him, and he
knew his worth. He knew, too, far bet-
ter than Gladstone himself, the kind of
public service for which he needed to be
trained. It is said that the young states-
man coveted the post of Chief Secretary
for Ireland, and that it was denied to
him. The Premier was too wise for the
mistake which that appointment would
have been. While Gladstone ~remained
unable to see anything in Ireland except
through the painted windows of the
Irish Church, the place he sought might
easily have been fatal to his future. He
did not know it then, but he must have
seen in after years that he owed grati-
tude to the shrewd wisdom of the chief
who assigned him, in the making up of
the administration of 1841, to the vice-
presidency of the Board of Trade, where
his duties came nowhere into touch with</PB>

questions concerning the Church, and
where the strongest of his faculties were
brought into full play. He became ab-
sorbed in economic studies at once, and
was insensibly drawn away from those
matters of ecclesiastical and theological
consideration which had oppressed and
hampered his mind. He now found the
class of subjects that he could handle
with the finest skill, the details that he
could master with the greatest power,
the kind of exposition in which he could
shine with most distinction in debate.
He had been led into the right path at
a critical parting of the ways. He had
entered upon his real career.
	At the same time, the Church, as a
national establishment of religion, was
being shown to him in a new light, by
workings within it which disappointed
expectations and beliefs that had been
the firmest in his mind. The Oxford
movement was proving to be a movement
Homeward, and the revival attempted
iu it had shaken instead of strengthen-
ing the English Church. The drift of
feeling and the drift of events were go-
ing plainly against that conception of the
Church which had been the dominating
idea in Mr. Gladstones mind. Twenty-
seven years later, ia A Chapter of Auto-
biography, he wrote his own account of
the change then beginning to be wrought
in his political view of the Established
Church.
	Summarized in a few words, the truth
appears to be that Mr. Gladstone was
now coming to the recognition of facts
in the light of which the Church could
not be any longer the main object in his
political views. To remove it from that
place in his thought was to take the cor-
ner-stone from his conservatism, and to
make inevitable a general crumbling of
the alien fabric of inherited and accepted
opinions. In coincidence with this re-
lease, as it may be called, occurred the
circumstance of his appointment to an
office that drew him into the imperious
current of economic discussion which
swept England in those years. It was
a discussion more certain than any other
that can be imagined to wash British
Toryism of the old sort out of a can-
did, intelligent brain. It had been do-
ing so with Peel; it was to do so with
Gladstone; and the evolution of the fu-
ture leader of English Liberalism from
the young man who in 1839 could
be called the rising hope  of stern
and unbending Tories was practically
accomplished in that fourth decade of
his life.
	Within the limits of this article the
story of Peels Ministry and its achieve-
ments cannot be told. Of the depression
and distress that England had suffered
since 1837; of the disorder that in-
creased; of the conflicting agitations that
rami politically into Chartism and com-
mercially into the overpowering work of
the Anti-Corn-Law League; of the grad-
ual surrrender of Peel to the free-trade
doctrines of Cobden, Bright, Vihliers,
and the irresistible league; of his mea-
sures, beginning with the sliding - scale
of corn duties and the significant tariff
revision of 1842, and ending in 1846
with the great act which uprooted protec~
tionism from British policy, and put the
seal of its surpassing wisdom on the su-
premacy of England iu the trade of the
world,  the tale has been often told,
and is familiar to most readers of the
present day. Gladstone kept step with
his leader, and was the ablest of lieu-
tenants in the whole advance. With
every stride forward they left more of
the heavy-footed squires of their own
country party behind, and drew more of
their support from the party they were
expected to oppose. It was treason they
committed, if we take the judgment of
the deserted Tories on what they did;
it was patriotism they exemplified, if the
history of England from that day till
now is permitted to testify.
	While Gladstone was thus finding the
way to his ultimate career, the rival
most contrasted to him, and destined to</PB>

dispute power with him most strenuous-
ly in the coining time, was doing the
same. Disraeli, who entered Parlia-
ment in 1837, had thus far made no
particular mark in the House. He had
amused and interested certain circles by
the rather heavy satire and enigmatical
doctrine of his political novels, and the
acrid wit of phrase-making in his speeches
was considerably enjoyed; but of p0-
litical weight it is manifest that he had
none. He was a free-lance in the House,
not to be counted on by any party or by
any faction of a party. He played with
some of the doctrines of radicalism at
one moment, as though they were the
joy and hope of his life, and tickled the
country squires at the next with a cod-
dling of their dearest beliefs. But when
it began to be seen that the stern and
unbending Tories were about to lose
their rising hope as well as their de-
parting chief, and that a desperate need
of leadership and debating talent was
soon to be felt in that venerable party of
the past, Disraeli sank himself comfort-
ably into the cool embrace of conserva-
tisin, as fast as Peel and Gladstone and
other men of shining ability rose out of
it.	It was so obviously the opening of
opportunity, the offered place of little
competition, the ground of advantage
for dexterous talents like his, that he
must have laughed at the humor of in-
genious Fortune when she beckoned him
to the half-deserted camp. Those were
the days when he first won the heart
of bucolic conservatism by the stinging
phrases that he flung at the organized
hypocrisy of perfidious ministers; by
the lively scorn that he heaped on the
bourgeois policy of free trade; by the
happy art with which he painted for
protectionism and the landed interest a
picturesque and historical background of
feudal origin and obligation, to distract
attention from their want of economic
support.
	In the last hours of the great battle
for free trade Peel lost the help of Glad-
stone. The latter had been advanced in
1843 from the vice-presidency to the
presidency of the Board of Trade, which
gave him a cabinet seat. In 1845, on
Peels proposal to increase the govern-
ment grant of money to the Roman Cath-
olic College of iMlaynooth in Ireland, and
to establish three non-sectarian colleges
in that country, Gladstone felt impelled
to resign, in order, as he afterward ex-
plained, to place himself in a position of
freedom to consider his course without
being liable to any unjust suspicion on
the ground of personal interest. But,
being free, he determined to give sup-
port to the bill, and did so by voice and
vote. Soon afterward the crisis of the
corn-law question was reached in Peels
cabinet; two of its members resigned,
and Mr. Gladstone, as Secretary for the
Colonies, came into the vacancy left by
Lord Stanley, the Lord Derby of later
years. Acceptance of this office involved
the resignation of his parliamentary seat.
Naturally, the Duke of Newcastle de-
clined to support his redection from
Newark, and Mr. Gladstone, unwilling
to make a contest for the seat, retired.
In the great debate of the session of 1846
his voice was not heard. Peel carried
his bill in May; but the Protectionists
had their revenge next month, when the
Liberals joined them in defeating a co-
ercion bill for Ireland, compelling the
Ministry to resign.
	The new government, formed by Lord
John Russell, with Lord Grey and Lord
Palmerston for his strongest associates,
had no party majority of their own to
depend on in the House; but the fallen
minister and his followers gave them a
generous support. They held the reins
for nearly six years, in the face of Irish
difficulties terribly increased by the fain-
me, and of a commercial crisis in Eng-
land that followed closely after. A gen-
eral election held in the fall of 1847
confirmed their tenure, and Mr. Glad-
stone was returned to Parliament by elec-
tion of the University of Oxford.</PB>

	The next few years were not eventful
ones in his life, though an eventful time
in European history. It was the period
of many revolutions, of the Schleswig-
Holstein war, and of the coup d6tat in
France. Spending the winter of 1850
with his family at Naples, Mr. Glad-
stone made a searching investigation of
the monstrous oppressions of the gov-
eminent of King Ferdinand, and an ex-
posure of them in letters to the Times,
which stirred all Europe, creating a
public feeling that even King Bomba
could not disregard. Later in that year
~he death of Sir Robert Peel occurred,
and the members of his personal follow-
ing in Parliament, known then and for
some time after as Peelites, were left
in an uncertain position. They were on
a middle ground in politics, between de-
fined Conservatives and Liberals, binding
themselves to neither. They were now
less likely to act en masse than when
their chief remained to lead them, but
they formed a factor to be reckoned with
still. They prevented a change of Min-
istry in 1851 by their refusal to join
hands with the Protectionist-Conserva-
tive party; and when, next year, the
Russell Ministry fell, it was Stanley
(now become Earl of Derby) and Dis-
raeli who undertook the government, the
Peelites remaining with the opposition.
The experiment of Conservative admin-
istration lasted only from February till
December. Disraeli, who had realized
his ambition and become the leader of
his party in the House, undertook the
Exchequer, and brought in a budget of
extraordinary cleverness in its trick-play-
ing with protection and free trade. It
was shattered by Gladstone, in a speech
that revealed fully for the first time his
never equaled power in the handling of
the subjects of public finance. The too
ingenious budget was thrown out by a
majority of nineteen, and the Derby-
Disraeli Ministry gave place to one head-
ed by the Earl of Aberdeen, in which
Peelites were in coalition with Whigs.
The new Ministry represented the first
stage in the organic construction of the
Liberal party of future politics. Mr.
Gladstone now stepped into Mr. Dis-
raelis place as Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, and the rivalry of the two
men became pronounced. True rivals
in finance, or in any of the higher spheres
of statesmanship, they could never be,
for one was scientific where the other
was ingenious, and warmly earnest where
the other was coolly shrewd; but in the
great arena of parliamentary debate they
were to head the strife of parties for
many years to come.
	The budget brought forward by Glad-
stone in April, 1853, is one of the recog-
nized masterpieces of national finance,
and the speech in which he unfolded it
was the first of many that are supreme
examples of political oratory in their
kind. That no other financier in his-
tory, so sound in his mastery of princi-
ples and so strong in his knowledge of
facts, has ever been able to make them
a subject of delightful eloquence, in the
degree to which they were made so by
Mr. Gladstone, seems beyond dispute.
	If the government of Lord Aberdeen
was financially strong, it was otherwise
weak. It allowed England to be drawn
into an alliance with the parvenu Emperor
of the French, and into a war with Rus-
sia that had no justifiable cause and no
useful result. It exasperated the nation
by its mismanagement of the war, and by
the consequent sufferings to which the
army in the Crimea was exposed. In
February, 1855, it was voted out of of-
fice, and a reorganization of Ministry
under Lord Palmerston occurred, after
Derby and Russell had each attempted
the task without success. Mr. Gladstone
and other Peelites withdrew, disagree-
ing with Palmerstons consent to a com-
mittee for investigating the condition
of the army before Sebastopol. There
was evidently some bitterness in the dis-
agreement; for Greville, in his diary,
July 29, 1855, says, Gladstone &#38; Co.</PB>

may now be considered as being in de-
cided opposition, and remarks, The
breach between them and the Whigs is
very wide, and the Derbyites hate them
with intensity, while they are too weak
to form a party of their own. Their
opposition, however, does not seem to
have gone far in animosity, and Glad-
stones attention must have been much
diverted from political affairs ; for it
was in this period that he wrote his
Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age.
Palmerston and his colleagues controlled
the government for three years. They
brought the Crimean war to a close, and
carried British rule in India through
the appalling crisis of the Sepoy revolt.
Their Ministry was succeeded in the
early part of 1858 by a new undertak-
ing of Conservative administration, with
Derby and Disraeli at its head. Mr.
Gladstone was still further removed from
parliamentary occupations for a time
by a mission of importance which he ac-
cepted, as Lord High Commissioner to
the Jonian Islands, with results that led
subsequently to the withdrawal of the
British protectorate, and the annexation
of the islands to the kingdom of Greece.
During one session skillful management
enabled Disraeli to avoid vital issues with
the majority against him in the House.
But when, in the next session, he at-
tempted a piece of strategy, bringing in
a new Ref ormn Bill for the confusion of
the Liberals, it was a characteristic per-
forumance, and it characteristically failed.
Like his budget of 1852 it was found to
be a too ingenious piece of work, and it
was condemned by the House. Lord
Palmerston took the premiership again,
with the reconciled Peelites among his
coadjutors, bringing a great array of
talent into the Ministry. Mr. Gladstone
was once more Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, and presently heightened his
fame as a minister of finance by his co-
operation with Cobden in negotiating the
treaty of commercial reciprocity with
France, and by his eradication of the
last remnants of protective duty from the
British tariff, accomplished in the budget
of 1860. This budget carried with it,
among its intended results, a great low-
ering of the price of paper, thus bring-
ing in the era of cheap newspapers and
books, which was most obnoxious to con-
servatism and gave rise to a fierce strug-
gle with the House of Lords.
	Of events that belong in this period,
the most important were those connected
with the civil war in the United States.
The attitude of Mr. Gladstone toward
the issues in that conflict was a matter of
the deepest interest to Americans then,
and has been hardly less so since. That
the British government as a whole, and
its members generally, should be coldly
neutral in form, and plainly unfriendly
to the United States in fact, could oc-
casion not much surprise. They repre-
sented socially a class or caste in which
that prevalent feeling toward tIme re-
public was very little disguised. But
Americans had been acquiring an idea of
Mr. Gladstone which led them to expect
something different from him,  some-
thing more in the spirit of Bright, of Cob-
den, and of Goldwin Smith,  and they
felt a sore disappointment and resentment
when he declared, in a speech made at
Neweastle-upon-Tyne, in October, 1862,
that Jefferson Davis had made an
army, had made a navy, and, more than
that, had made a nation. It was half
true, and it could easily seem wholly true
at the time; but it was not what a friend
of the American Union would say. It
was virtually a recognition of the South-
ern Confederacy, and it had enormous
significance and weight, coming from a
man in Mr. Gladstones official place and
with the personal influence that he pos-
sessed even then. Some years afterward,
Mr. Gladstone took pains to disclaim un-
friendly intentions in what he said, con-
fessed the mistake of the opinion he had
uttered, and attempted an explanation
which saddens one a little in reading,
because it limps so lamely. I must</PB>

confess that I was wrong, he said;
that I took too much upon myself in
expressing such an opinion. Yet the
motive was not bad. My sympathies
were then  where they had long before
been, where they are now  with the
whole American people. I, probably,
like many Europeans, did not understand
the nature and the working of the Amer-
ican Union. I had imbibed conscien-
tiously, if erroneously, an opinion that
twenty or twenty-four millions of the
North would be happier and would be
stronger  of course assuming that they
would hold together  without the South
than with it, and also that the negroes
would be much nearer to emancipation
under a Southern government than un-
der the old system of the Union, which
had not at that date been abandoned,
and which always appeared to me to
place the whole power of the North at
the command of the slaveholding inter-
ests of the South. As far as regards
the special or separate interest of Eng-
land in the matter, I, differing from
many others, had always contended that
it was best for our interest that the
Union should be kept entire. Now,
really, this is not a convincing plea.
The Newcastle utterance was too em-
phatically favorable to Mr. Daviss na-
tion to be quite in agreement with the
feelings here described. Yet, after all,
the offense of Mr. Gladstone ought not
to be an unforgivable one. In the au-
tumn of 1862, after McClellans Penin-
sular campaign, after the second Bull
Run, after Lees invasion of Maryland, it
was hard for the firmest foreign friends
of the Union to have faith in its restora-
tion, and confidence in the effectiveness
of President Lincolns Emancipation
Proclamation, then just put forth. The
influence needed to keep alive foreign
faith in the Union cause was a deep and
dire hatred of slavery, but hatred of sla-
very was mild in Mr. Gladstone, if not
wanting entirely. He was removed by
less than thirty years from the time
when his family drew no small part of
its wealth from slave labor, and it is nat-
ural to suppose that he was less likely
than other Englishmen of kindred char-
acter to be prejudiced against the Con~
federacy by its corner - stone. But
that he was ever inspired by a mean
sentiment of hostility to Americans and
their country cannot be reasonably be-
lieved. The signs of disposition in his
whole life are against that interpreta-
tion of his words. He spoke from an
unsound judgment, most unwisely; and
that is a sin for which he has needed
forgiveness more than once. If he had
been entirely a wise man, he would not
have been a great orator, he would not
have wielded the extraordinary power
of his enthusiasms, he would not have
been Gladstone. Because he was Glad-
stone, Americans can forget his New
castle words with no great difficulty.
	Parliament was dissolved by expira~
tion of its term in 1865, and at the fol-
lowing general election Mr. Gladstone
lost his Oxford seat. His opinions had
become too liberal for the university,
especially since misgivings with regard
to the Irish Church had begun to find
expression in his speeches, and it cast
him out. But Lancashire gave him a
seat, and he was thenceforth more entire-
ly untrammeled as a representative than
he had ever been before. The last thread
of connection with the conservatism of
his early life had been cut. He took his
stand definitely, erelong, by the side of
John Bright and the more advanced of
the Liberal leaders, as one of the trib-
unes of the common people. Palmer-
ston died in October, 1865, and Russell
came to the head of the government.
The introduction of a bill to answer
the long-resisted demand for a further
reform and extension of the elective
franchise was decided upon, and Mr.
Gladstone brought it forward iii the
House. It proved to be too conserva-
tive to interest the Radicals greatly, but
too radical for the more conservative</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00019" SEQ="0019" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="13">	&#38; ladstone.	13
Liberals, and the overthrow of the gov-
ernment was brought about by it. The
death-blow was given by a few professed
Liberals, led by Mr. Lowe, who got the
name of Adullamites from one of the
witty speeches of Mr. Bright.
	Lord Derby and Mr. Disraeli now
formed another Ministry, which endured
for a little more than two years. It
promptly took up the agitated question
of reform, and, by making large conces-
sions to the Liberals, passed a bill that
went much farther in the democratic
direction than the measure lately de-
feated, and which caused deep Tory dis-
gust. The first appeal made to the new
constituencies thus created proved fatal
~o the responsible authors of the bill.
This occurred in 1868, on a question in-
7olving the fate of the Church establish-
merit in Ireland. Mr. Gladstone had be-
come convinced that justice to Ireland
and peace in that country were impossi-
ble without the disestablishment of the
church which nine tenths of the Irish
people abhorred. He introduced reso-
lutions, accordingly, and carried them
aga the government. A dissolution
of Parliament was the consequence; but
it was postponed until November, when
elections were held under the new law.
They resulted in a large Liberal majori-
ty, distinctly given in support of the
policy of Irish Church disestablishment
proposed by Mr. Gladstone.
	That gentleman was now, conspicuous-
ly and beyond question, the head of the
party that had triumphed in the elec-
tions. It was inevitable that he should
take direction of the government, and
the way was naturally opened by the
recent retirement of Lord John Russell
from public life. In the cabinet which
he formed, on the Queens invitation, sev-
eral men of subsequent note were first
brought to the political front,  Lord
Hartington, Mr. Goschen, Mr. Lowe,
Mr. Forster, and Lord Dufferin, of the
number,  while Mr. Bright made his
entry into cabinet office as president of
the Board of Trade. Mr. Gladstone, in
his fifty-ninth year, was now at the sum-
mit of his intellectual powers, but not
yet at the zenith of his renown. From
the height of his supreme office, he exer-
cised after this time, over England, an
influence that grew to be more dominat-
ing than any known in English history
before, unless the very different influ-
ence of the Pitts may possibly be com-
pared with it.
	From 1868 to 1874 this first Prime
Ministry of Gladstone was filled with
great tasks, heroically undertaken and
performed. First, of course, was the
disestablishment of the Irish Church, in
which the national mandate was obeyed.
At this time he published the Chapter
of Autobiography, already cited, to an-
swer the critics who denounced his
change of attitude toward the Protes-
tant establishment in Ireland since the
long - past days when it had seemed a
sacred thing in his eyes. Disestablish-
ment delivered Ireland from one op-
pression; another, more productive of
misery, though not more exasperating,
remained. The Irish land system, con-
trived and perfected, without conscience,
in the interest of a half-alien landlord
class, living generally elsewhere, and
caring nothing for the country or the
people, was iniquitous almost beyond be-
lief. Tenants had no defined tenure and
no rights under it. Landlords held un-
limited power to rob them of improve-
ments, exact extortionate rents, evict
them at will. It was an old wrong, 
older than the English colonial slavery
that had been dead for a generation, and
which had been scarcely more cruel, 
but it had cried to deaf ears until now.
And now the cry from Ireland, of all
her grievances, had grown louder than
it was even in the days of Daniel OCon-
nell. A resounding, threatening echo
to it was coming back from the millions
of emigrated Irish in America. Instead
of being weakened by the prodigious
movement of her population to the New</PB>

World, Ireland had gained from it a new
strength for resistance to her unending
oppression. The Irish in Anierica had
prospered. Great numbers of them had
just gone through a soldierly training
in the American civil war. They had
money and men and captains to offer to
any movement on behalf of Ireland that
could be set on foot. From this stimu-
lation came the Fenian conspiracy of
186569, which at least compelled the
giving of more serious thought in Eng-
land to Irish grievances than had been
given to them before. Mr. Gladstone
and others of like mind had now arrived
at the determination that those griev-
ances should be removed, that the Irish
people should be pacified by justice, and
that the chronic disease of hatred in one
part of the United Kingdom toward the
other part, poisonous and imperiling to
the whole body politic, should be radi-
cally cured. He addressed himself to
the difficult problem of the reform of
the Irish land laws with characteristic
thoroughness, personally mastering the
subject in its technical details and in its
legal and historical ramifications so com-
pletely that his knowledge, when he dealt
with it, was overwhelming to his oppo-
nents and amazing to his friends. His
Irish land bill was introduced in Feb-
ruary, 1870, in a speech of which the
biographer of the late Mr. W. E. For-
ster has said: A crowded House had
sat entranced whilst Mr. Gladstone had
given that wonderful account of the pro-
visions of his Irish land bill, which is
regarded by many competent critics as
the most remarkable of his oratorical
achievements. He seemed to be always
able to arouse new admiration by each
effort that he made; and the more stub-
born the subject, the more fascinating
his eloquence became. Contest over the
bill consumed some months, but it was
passed in the August following. That it
only half succeeded in its aims is hardly
strange. The power of the landlords to
oppress their tenants was too great to be
baffled on the first attempt. They found
loopholes in the act, and contrived means
to evade its intentions in many exas-
perating ways. But the great fact that
English statesmen and the English peo-
ple had begun to show in earnest a will
to do justice to Ireland, and that land-
lords and clergy were no longer to be
undisputed in its affairs, had a potent
effect. Deep discontent remained, but
the violent spirit in it was sapped. Fe-
manism died out, and no really revolu-
tionary undertaking has assumed form
since. The movement for home rule
grew up in place of the struggle for na-
tional independence; and though Ire-
land became afterward a more trouble-
some factor in British politics than ever
before, this was because it bad been fair-
ly brought into the national politics in-
stead of being thrust outside.
	One thing more Mr. Gladstone at-
tempted to do for Ireland, by the cre-
ation of a national university, broad
enough to cover colleges of all creeds;
but the attempt failed. For education
in England, his government took the
first great and difficult step toward the
institution of a national system of ele-
mentary schools. The scheme of its edu-
cation bill, framed and carried through
by Mr. Forster, perpetuated the Church
schools, and received more Conservativg
than Liberal support, being bitterly op-
posed by a strong radical party which
had been striving for a national system
of strictly secular schools; but it was the~
beginning of duty in a matter that had
suffered shameful neglect. Introduction
of the ballot, abolition of the sale and
purchase of army commissions, and set-
tlement of the Alabama claims by the
Treaty of Washington with the United
States were among the other notable
achievements of the Gladstone govern-
ment. It seems to have tired the nation
at last with an excess of good work, and
early in 1874 the Premier felt called
upon, without immediate provocation
from Parliament, to make an appeal to</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00021" SEQ="0021" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="15">	Gladstone.	15

the country, to test public opinion on his
policy, including measures to come. The
elections were adverse, and he resigned.
Mr. Disraeli was called to the premier-
ship, and formed a strong Ministry, with
a strong majority in Parliament to give
it support.
	Release from office brought with it to
Mr. Gladstone a longing for still further
release from the labors and responsibil-
ities of his leadership in the Liberal
party. With all the intensity of his life
in Parliament, it had never been the
whole of life to him. He had kept large
reserves of other interests, to which he
always turned with delight in every hour
of escape from official cares. The tastes
of the student were never extinguished
in him by the busy habits of the man of
affairs. Amid now, at sixty-five, after
the accomplishment of so many of his
parliamentary aims, a great desire to
bring more of the sweetness of rest and
letters and domestic privacy into the
remaining years of his life came upon
him. It is not hard to see that this de-
sire was most natural to him, at that
point in his life, though it might not
last; and yet, when he announced his
wish to withdraw, at no distant time,
from all the responsibilities of leader-
ship, every possible motive of meanness
was looked for by his political enemies
to explain the act. In his owii party,
hardly less than consternation and hope-
lessness was caused by the thought of
losing him from the place of command;
but he persisted in claiming his release.
I see no public advantage, he said,
in my continuing to act as the leader
of the Liberal party, and at the age
of sixty-five, after forty-two years of a
laborious public life, I think myself en-
titled to retire on the present opportuni-
ty. This retirement is dictated to me
by my personal views as to the best
method of spending the closing years of
my life.... I should, perhaps, add that
I am at present, and mean for a short
time to be, engaged on a special matter
that occupies me closely. The special
matter referred to proved to be the
pamphlet on The Vatican Decrees which
he published sooii after. It represents
the kind of occupation to which he hoped
to give the remainder of his life.
	Soomi after the opening of the session
in 1875 Mr. Gladstone stepped down to
a followers place in the Liberal ranks,
and the Marquis of Hartington took, re-
luctantly, time leaders post. Lord Hart-
ington (now Duke of Devonshire) is an
able man; but he had little of Glad-
stones strength in debate, and nothing
of his enthusiasm. There was no moral
momentum in his nature to carry him
and his party forward to higher ground
and further ends. Half the vigor of
English Liberalism was soon found to
have disappeared, and Disraelis task of
government was made easy to lminm by a
languid opposition. In domestic mat-
ters the new Premier pursued a course
to be generally admired, particularly in
the passing of important measures of
sanitary reform; but he looked to for-
eign affairs for the distinction of his
Ministry. It was in this period of his
administration that the terms Jingo
and Jingoism came into use, and the
barbaric war spirit that they signify was
deliberately instigated and used by Dis-
raeli at the time. He had appealed to
it in the elections which brought him
into power. As stated by his Tory bio-
grapher, Mr. Kebbel, he had spoken to
the British workmen of England; of
her glory and her duty; of the imperial
inheritance which their ancestors had
won, and which they must transmit to
their posterity; of the proud position
which she occupied among the nations
of the world, and of the divine mission
which it was her privilege to fulfill in the
spread of civilization and religion. In
an age of economy and materialism,
exclaims Mr. Kebbel, of cheap break-
fast - tables and bread - and - butter pro-
sperity, these accents fell upon the public
ear, long unaccustomed to such sounds,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00022" SEQ="0022" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="16">	16	Gladstone.
with thrilling power. So England
cheered and shouted, and sang music-
hall songs, for the time, over a splendid
imperial policy, of protection, to the
rotten despotism of the Turk, of antago-
nism to Russia, of advance to a scien-
tific frontier for India, of ownership
in the Suez Canal, of extended South
African possessions. In the midst of
the glory of it, Mr. Disraeli crowned his
career in a fitting way by accepting an
earidom from the Queen, and sinking
his plebeian name in the title of Lord
Beaconsfield.
	Meantime, Mr. Gladstone had heen
drawn back irresistibly into the practi-
cal leadership of the Liberal party hy
excitements incident to Turkish affairs,
caused especially by the atrocities in
Bulgaria. He could not keep out of
the fray, nor enter the fray without be-
ing in the front of it. His voice rang
out against longer adherence to a shame-
ful protectorate over the Turk, main-
tained to keep the carcass of his dead
empire in the way of a Russian advance
to the Mediterranean. Jingoism fell be-
fore the assaults of common sense and
Christian feeling. In vain were there
banners and trumpetings when Lord
Beaconsfield came back from the settle-
ment of the Treaty of Berlin, boasting
of peace with honor. The country at
large saw emptiness in the outcome of
his imperial policy, and gave its pre-
ference to the homely bread-and-butter
prosperity that seemed to be slipping
away. Elections held in 1880, on the
dissolution of Parliament, were over-
whelmingly in favor of the Liberals.
Mr. Gladstones Midlothian speeches had
been the inspiration of the campaign,
and had given its programme to the
party. It was possible for no other man
to command the political situation, and
no other could take the responsibility of
government. He could not escape from
it if he would.
	The brief retirement of Mr. Glad-
stone to a less burdened life was then
followed by the most troubled and try-
ing period of his career. It is doubtful
if any statesman was ever more painful-
ly harassed by more varied misfortunes
and difficulties, more innocently as to the
causing of most among them, than was
Gladstone in the five years of his second
administration. From the spirited pol-
icy of his predecessor he received a
fine legacy of troubles: a British army
trapped in Afghanistan; a Boer war,
provoked by wrongs which a just British
government must redress; a situation in
Egypt leading to the Arabi revolt, to its
necessary suppression by British troops,
to consequent responsibilities on the Nile,
demanding the withdrawal of Egyptian
garrisons from the Soudan, to Gordons
mission to Khartoum, to his beleaguer-
ment by the Mahdists, and to the res-
cuing expedition which came too late.
The anxieties and the storms of party
malice which these events produced were
enough to bow the shoulders of a younger
man than Mr. Gladstone, but they may
have seemed light to him compared with
the tempest from Ireland that broke upon
his government.
	The Land Act of 1870 had proved
to be abortive legislation. At the trial
before the Parnell commission in 1888
Sir Charles Russell produced abundant
evidence of its failure to give tenants
the protection designed. It had proba-
bly, on the whole, made matters in Ire-
land worse by excitement and disap-
pointment of hopes, and by provoking
what seemed to be a conspiracy in the
meaner class of landlords to drive the
Irish peasantry to despair. Evictions in
1880 were double the yearly average of
the preceding quarter-century. Statis-
tics submitted to the Parnell commis-
sion show an average in Connaught,
between 1853 and 1878, of 960 evic-
tions per year, increased in 1880 to
1995; in Munster, 1076, increased to
2345. In December, 1880, General
Gordon, who is a witness to be trusted
by all the world, visited the southwest of</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00023" SEQ="0023" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="17">	Gladstone.	iT
Ireland, in the hope, as he said, of
discovering how some settlement could
be made of the Irish question, which,
like a fretting cancer, eats away our
vitals as a nation. On his return he
wrote as follows to the Times: I have
come to the conclusion that, first, a gulf
of antipathy exists between the land-
lords and tenants of the northwest and
west and the southwest of Ireland. It
is a gulf which is not caused alone by
the question of rents; there is a com-
plete lack of sympathy between the
classes. . . . Second, no half - measure
acts which left the landlords with any
say to the tenantry of those portions of
Ireland will be of any use. They would
be rendered, as past land acts in Ireland
have been, quite abortive, for the land-
lords will insert clauses to do away with
their force. He concluded by saying
that the state of our fellow countrymen
in the parts I have named is worse than
that of any people in the world, let alone
Europe, and that yet they are patient
beyond belief, loyal, but at the same
time broken - spirited and desperate.
Action in Ireland against this terrible
state of things was being doubly organ-
ized, with two aims, soon to be combined
in one. The Land League of Michael
Davitt set itself in array against land-
lordism as a curse to be wholly rooted
out, while the party for Home Rule, now
consolidated under a new and masterful
leader, Mr. Parnell, made the conces-
sion of a separate legislature to Ireland
its ultimate demand. The league and
the party were allied and powerfully
equipped with means for making them-
selves felt.
	This was the Irish situation that con-
fronted Mr. Gladstone when he resumed
the task of government. He formed a
Ministry that seemed promising of great
sympathy and generosity in treatment of
the hard problems involved. Mr. For-
ster, Quaker-bred, and especially known
to the Irish people r.s their well-proved
friend, was given the direction of mea

sures for Ireland in the important Chief
Secretarys place. Mr. Bright came into
the cabinet; likewise Mr. Chamberlain,
representing extreme Birmingham radi-
calism, and close in relations with the
Irish party; while Sir Charles Dilke, of
kindred politics, held a lower adminis-
trative place. Ireland seemed to be well
befriended in the government, yet no
government before was ever involved in
an antagonism so bitter with its subjects
in the Celtic isle. The very cordialities
that were in the situation at first proved
mischievous in the end. The Irish ex-
pected too much from the government,
and too soon. The government, on its
side, expected too much trust in its
friendly spirit and too much patient
waiting. Mr. Forster, especially, would
seem to have looked for a faith in him-
self that was not manifested to his sat-
isfaction. So feelings that were sym-
pathetic at first soon cooled, and an
estrangement began that quickly grew
to hostility of the fiercest kind. The
government, unwilling to take up at
once the troublesome project of a new
land bill, passed a bill through the House
making temporary provision of redress
for the persecuted tenants. It was killed
by an overwhelming majority in the
House of Lords. This let loose the im-
pending storm. Ireland had been wak-
ened from despair to hope, and now hope
gave way to wrath, and wrath bred vio-
lence, and violence provoked the chastis-
ing arm of oppressive power. The scenes
of murder and riot that ensued, the dy-
namite explosions, the organized boy-
cotting, the systematized suspension of
rent payments, and all the varied contri-
vances of disorder that added ruin to
ruin in Ireland during the next few years
are remembered well. So, too, are the
scenes that followed in the British Par-
liament. The sixty-two representatives
of the Home Rule party, led as a solid
phalanx by Mr. Parnell, and determined
that no other business should be done
while Irish questions suffered neglect,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00024" SEQ="0024" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="18">	18	Gladstone.
practically paralyzed the House for
weeks by their tactics of obstruction.
Thea the Speaker, taking power arbi-
trarily into his hands, broke the rules of
the House, silenced the obstructionists,
and enabled the Ministry to pass a co-
ercion bill which gave them despotic
powers. Armed with these powers, Mr.
Forster applied them with unmerciful
severity. An obstinate Yorkshire na-
ture underlying his Quaker culture was
roused, and he acted in the spirit of a
Tory of some past generation. He filled
the prisons with suspects, including
Mr. Parnell and other Irish leaders, for
a time, and persisted in stubborn blind-
ness to the fact that terror can never
make peace.
	Of course, Mr. Gladstone, as the head
of the government, must be held to ac-
count for the sad blundering of this un-
happy time. It is said that he never
believed in the repressive policy of Mr.
Forster; and that is probably true. But
he countenanced it too long  allowed
it to go too far  for his own fair fame.
One feels, too, in reviewing the story,
that if he had realized the threat of the
situation at an early day, and had brought
his whole energy and influence to bear
on its difficulties in the beginning, there
might have been a very different course
of events. It is quite possible that he
did not willingly believe in the com-
pleteness of the failure of his own Land
Act of 1870, and met the demand for
its. revision too indifferently because too
skeptically. This may not be so, but it
seems to be a reasonable conjecture;
there is some suggestion of it in the
awakened vigor with which Mr. Glad-
stone pressed a new land bill through
both houses of Parliament between April
and August of 1881, immediately after
Mr. Forsters coercion bill, and while
the bludgeon that the latter fashioned
was being most roughly used. Natural-
ly, under the circumstances, the new
act, which created a tribunal to adjudi-
cate rents, was an inadequate piece of
work. It was repudiated by the Irish
Nationalist members, who refused to vote
on the second reading of it, while it
drew fresh denunciations from the land-
lords and their friends. Mr. Lecky,
holding a brief for the latter, devotes a
considerable section of his work on De-
mocracy to an argument, which we ven-
ture to call fallacious, against this act,
as being in violation of contract between
the British government and the pur-
chasers of property in Ireland under the
Incumbered Estates Act of 1849. As
a matter of fact, the principle of the
Land Bill of 1881 has been practically
maintained by Conservatives as well as
Liberals in legislation since, and provi-
sions to improve its working have been
added by both.
	The policy of Mr. Forster was pur-
sued unrelentingly until April, 1882.
Then some kind of overture from Mr.
Parnell, in Kilmainham prison, was wel-
comed by the government, and a truce
was arranged which brought active hos-
tilities between the contending parties to
an end. Mr. Forster, refusing assent to
it, resigned, and Lord Frederick Caven-
dish was appointed to his place. The
assassination of the new Secretary, quick-
ly following, in Dublin, caused no renew-
al of the state of war, but rather, by
the horror of it, sobered all parties in
the political world. Parliament was able
once more to give attention to neglected
affairs. The session of 1883 produced
the important law by which corrupt prac-
tices in English elections have been ef-
fectually suppressed. In the next years
session a bill for further enlargement
of the elective franchise was passed by
the Commons, only to be rejected by the
Lords, with a consequent excitement the
most threatening to the Upper House
that had ever appeared. Public demon-
strations of feeling had their warning ef-
fect, and the franchise bill,  the third
Reform Bill of English history,  passed
again in November, was accepted by the
peers, with a supplementary act which</PB>

distributes more fairly the parliamentary
seats.
	In the winter of 1885, failure to res-
cue General Gordon from Khartoum,
added to other causes, turned public
feeling very strongly against the gov-
ernment, and in June it resigned, after
a vote carried against it in the House.
The Conservatives formed a Ministry un-
der Lord Salisbury (Lord Beaconsfield
being no more), and were in power dur-
ing the following seven months. Elec-
tions for a new Parliament  the first
under the extended franchise  were
held in November, and resulted in a sin-
gular situation. The Conservatives, now
helped by the Irish vote in England,
made gains in the towns, while the Lib-
erals swept the counties. At the same
time, in Ireland, the Home Rulers elect-
ed eighty-five of the one hundred and
three in the total representation of the
island, and held the balance of power.
The Liberal vote in the House of Com-
mons was almost equaled by the combined
vote of Conservative and Irish members.
It was plain policy for the latter to re-
turn to their former alliance with the
Liberals, and they did so. The Salisbury
Ministry went out of office in the follow-
ing January.
	And now came the part of Mr. Glad-
stones public life which brought both
his statesmanship and his character most
seriously and most bitterly into dispute.
Called again, for the third time, to be
Prime Minister of England, he accepted
the great office virtually at the hands of
the Irish party, without whose support
it could not be held, and with it he ac-
cepted their programme of home rule
for Ireland. It is believed by his ene-
mies that greed of power was the pre-
vailing motive to this course, whatever
reasons in its favor he might have per-
suaded himself to see; and it is possible
that the purity of the convictions on
which Mr. Gladstone acted at this junc-
ture may always be called in question.
But if we weigh all the circumstances
without prejudice, we find no just rea-
son for a suspicion of his absolute sin-
cerity. The most reasonable assump-
tions are entirely in his favor. It is not
reasonable to suspect that in his seventy.
seventh year, after harvesting all the
honors that public life could yield to
him, after escaping from a Ministry that
had nearly broken him with its many
troubles,  it is not reasonable, in the
light of all that we know of his charac-
ter and his studious tastes, to suspect
that he was drawn back to the strife
and labor of parliamentary government
by a merely personal ambition so strong
as to warp the convictions of his mind.
It is reasonable to suppose that he felt
a great ambition to end the unendura-
ble conflict between the members of the
United Kingdom; and no ambition could
be more honorable than that, whatever
thought of self might mix in it. There
are facts, too, which show that Mr.
Gladstone had been seeking light on the
question of Irish home rule for some
years. Mr. Justin McCarthy has given
some of them in his recent Story of
Gladstones Life. Back in 1882, Mr.
McCarthy tells us, when the Home Rule
members were a minority of the Irish re-
presentation in Parliament, the Premier
questioned him one day as to the ground
on which they could claim to speak and
act for the Irish people. How am I
to know? he asked. The reply was:
Give us a popular franchise in Ireland,
and we shall soon let you know whe-
ther we represent the Irish people or
whether we do not. Three years later
Gladstone gave the popular franchise to
Ireland as well as to Great Britain, anJ
the elections then held raised the Home
Rule representation to more than four
fifths of the whole. That the mind of
Mr. Gladstone had been meantime in ~
waiting state on the subject, and that
this proof of Irish sentiment was deci
sive to him, does not seem to be fairly
open to doubt.
	But the wisdom of Mr. Gladstones</PB>

course is more questionable than the sin-
cerity of it. The subject on that side is
bo large for this article, yet a few words
must be said. In his first plan, submit-
ted to Parliament on the 8th of April,
1886, he proposed to give Ireland a dis-
tinct legislature, with substantial mdc-
pendence in the control of its domestic
affairs, but to silence its voice in the
larger affairs of the United Kingdom
by taking its representation in the Im-
perial Parliament entirely away. The
Liberal party was broken by the start-
ling proposition. Eighty-five of its mem-
bers seceded and joined the Conserva-
tives to defeat the bill. Mr. Gladstone
appealed by a dissolution, and was beat-
en in the country overwhelmingly. The
seceding Liberals, taking the name of
Unionists, formed a coalition with the
Conservatives in a Ministry which held
the government, under Lord Salisbury,
for six years, until the P4rhiament ex-
pired. Then Mr. Gladstone, still full
of vigor, and firm in his resolution to
give home rule to Ireland, renewed his
appeal to the people. The elections of
1892 went against him in England, but
favorably in Scotland and Wales, and
strongly favorable in Ireland, of course.
Without the Irish members he would
be heavily outvoted in the House; with
them he had a majority of forty-two.
On this dubious verdict he undertook
his fourth Ministry, and brought for-
ward his second home rule bill. It was
radically different from the first in plan,
giving Ireland eighty members in the
House of Commons at London (with no
vote there on matters affecting Great
Britain alone), and a domestic legisla-
ture of two houses at Dublin. The Com-
mons passed the bill, and the Lords, as
expected, threw it out. Mr. Gladstone
saw the uselessness of a dissolution, or
of agitation against the peers. He went
stoutly through other business of the
session to the end, and even to April of
the following year. Then he resigned.
He had finished his political career.
	As proved by the result  doubly
proved by all that has appeared since 
England was very far from willingness
to give Ireland the demanded home rule.
Beyond (loubt, the unwillingness was
greater than popular votes or parliamen-
tary votes disclosed. The amazing in-
fluence of Mr. Gladstone, his unequaled
persuasiveness, his overpowering pres-
tige, had almost carried his party with
him against its will. iNo other man could
have made a show of approach to suc-
cess in what he undertook. As a tour
de force in popular leading it has never,
perhaps, been surpassed. But that kind
of triumph thinly gilds the actual fail-
ure. Had Mr. Gladstone been a states-
man more calculating of consequences,
either political or personal, more saga-
cious, either in public views or in party
views, more prudent, either selfishly or
patriotically, it can hardly be believed
that he would have framed his measures
as lie did, or attempted them at the time.
Nor, from an American standpoint, does
England seem blamable for the rejection
of them. We are experienced in the
working of home rule with national uni-
ty; we know federalism in theory and
in practice; but there is nothing in our
experience or our political philosophy
to give us an understanding of the the-
ory or a belief in the practicability of
either of the constitutional projects of
Mr. Gladstone for the future govern-
ment of Ireland. Whether Ireland,
under the first of them, would be a part
or not a part of the United Kingdom 
a dependency or a nation  is puzzling
to our comprehension. Whether Eng-
land, Wales, and Scotland, denied home-
ruling legislation by the second scheme,
while Ireland rejoiced in it, would hold
an equality of rights and a peerage of
rank in the United Kingdom, is no less a
problem. Of either plan, the incongrui-
ty, the inconsistency with any principle,
the departure froni all experience, seem
most extraordinary.
	In these home rule measures Mr.</PB>

Gladstone had set his hand for the first
time to an important undertaking of
constructive statesmanship; and the ver-
dict mj~st be that he was not equal to it.
His life-work has been in reforming
statesmanship. In that he has had no
peer. He has been, we may say, the
greatest of those peaceful revolutionists
who lift and carry nations forward, out
of old conditions into new; who recon-
cile their institutions with advancing
time, and make them participant in the
progress of the world. But this repa-
rative work, most useful, perhaps, that
true statesmanship can do, wins com-
monly less of the admiration of mankind
than the framing of political systems
and the building of states. Bismarck
and Cavour, among Gladstones contem-
poraries, are more than likely to rank
above him, in present and in future opin-
ion, as belonging to an order of states-
men that is superior in its kind. The
justice of that opinion is far from sure.
It turns mostly upon a question of weight
in moral qualities that are widely op-
posed. But the fact of it is to be recog-
nized; and so, too, is the fact that when
Gladstone attempted a serious work of
constructive statesmanship he failed.
	A grievous ending for so great and so
noble a career! It ought to have been
ended for him in the serene contentment
of some crowning success. In no pro-
cession of noisy triumph, but by some
flower - strewn and beautiful way he
should have gone to his retirement with
a happily satisfied heart. He had done
so much for England,  for Britain, for
Ireland! He had labored so long, so
hopefully, so valiantly, so hard! He
had struck, without favor or fear, at so
many wrongs! He had remembered so
faithfully the whole people, and borne
so calmly the selfish resentments of a
selfish class! He had warmed the very
heart of the world so often with his gen-
erous enthusiasms! He had been for
half a century so inspiring a figure in
the eyes of all mankind, so chivalrous
in standing for Right! One feels that
there might fitly have been a trooping of
all the people of British race to say Hail
and Farewell to him when he went out
of public life.
	Gladstones place in English history
will be high, and it will be quite apart
from any other. He will have no near
companionship in his fame. It will be,
we think, an eminence assigned to moral
qualities more than to intellectual pow-
ers. The very sincerity that his enemies
have denied to him will be counted per-
haps the loftiest of his claims. It will
be seen that few men of brilliant gifts
and great ambitions have sought with
his earnestness for the Right in what
they did, or have stood with his courage
by what they found it to be. When
he braved the scorn and anger of the
Church which has always been more to
him than to most of its priests, and
challenged by the same act his own past,
in order to (10 justice to the people of
another creed, and when he made a
righteous peace with the Boers in the
face of a storm of English wrath, lie
rose to a greatness in character that
will be measured in future time with
clearer eyes than now.
	The persuasive witchery of his elo-
quence will be poorly understood by
generations to come. It is not found in
the word, the phrase, the argument, or
the thought. It came for the most part
from the spirit that warmed the breath
of the man, sounded in his voice, looked
out of his eyes. It was personal to him~
largely drawn from the moral qualities
that seemed to be his greater distinction.
No man of his day has had such power
of persuasion as he. It may not be too
bold to say that no man of any time has
surpassed him in that power. Yet he
was never logically strong. His argu-
mentative writings, the most cai~efully
and deliberately composed, show defects
of reasoning that are marked. From
controversy with an antagonist like Pro-
fessor Huxley he was sure to come with</PB>

wounds. Yet his masterful influence
over minds of every class is a certain
fact. It was once said by somebody
that Gladstone could persuade any-
body to anything,  himself included;
and no doubt the epigram carries a sig-
nificant truth. Fashion a man finely
and largely, and make him to be tensely
strung in every part of his whole nature,
but inject a little, barely a little excess
on the moral and emotional side,  a
little more of feeling, with pressure of
conscience behind it, than logical jndg-
inent can quite control,  and we shall
lave the persuasive man who is over-
persuasive sonietimes to himself. On
the great scale, as in Gladstone, it pro-
duces a rare and splendid power for the
kind of work he had to do,  a r~re and
splendid character for the delight and
admiration of mankind. It kept him
in the strength and beauty of youth
till he died. It did more; for he was
younger in spirit, younger in the gen-
erosities and hospitalities of his mind,
when his work was finished than when
it began. He, at least, in this ques-
tioning nineteenth century, found well-
springs of faith in both God and man,
and drank of them to the end.





THE ESSENTIAL UNITY OF BRITAIN AND AMERICA.

	THE editor of The Atlantic Monthly,
a magazine which has always sought to

THE ESSENTIAL UNITY OF BRITAIN AND AMERICA.

	THE editor of The Atlantic Monthly,
a magazine which has always sought to
treat current questions in a broad and
impartial way, asks me to say a few
words on a subject which is much in
mens minds on both sides of the Atlan-
tic,  the underlying unity of the English
and American peoples, and the causes
which have produced that sympathy be-
tween them which has been so conspic-
uously displayed during the last few
months.
	The sense of unity and sympathy be-
tween these two peoples ought in rea-
son and nature always to have existed.
It has, in point of fact, existed to a much
greater extent than has been generally
realized. No American can travel in
England, no Englishman can travel in
America, without realizing it as a strong-
er force than he could have gathered
from a study of the history of the coun-
tries since their political separation.
	There is indeed much reason for think-
ing that the irritation which has some-
times been shown in each country at the
language used by the government or the
newspapers of the other has been due
largely to the undercurrent of affection
which each felt for the other, and which
made unfriendly or affronting expres-
sions more resented than similar lan-
guage would have been from a nation
less closely bound by the ties of blood
and literature and historical traditioii.
However, despite this occasional irrita-
tion, the sense of the essential unity of
the two branches of the same stock has
been growing steadily stronger in Brit-
am during the last twenty years, and the
events of these last months have made
it more palpably evident in both coun-
tries. It is chiefly of Britain, and of

has witnessed. It was first in the eco-
nomic and social sphere that the results
of this revolution were perceived. They
have now become enormously significant
in politics also. The great nations of
Europe have stretched forth their arms
over the whole globe, and have parceled
out among themselves those of its ter-
ritories which had been previously in-
habited by savages or possessed by weak
semi-civilized powers, bringing under
their control even those regions in which
a few of the weaker powers have still
been permitted to retain a nominal inde-
pendence. Russia, which was first in the
field, has obtained the whole of northern
and large parts of western and eastern
Asia. England, besides planting self-
governing colonies in North America and
Australia and South Africa, holds India
with its huge and industrious population,
large tracts of tropical Africa, and many
important posts in other quarters. France
has taken a vast area in North Africa,
as well as parts of Central Africa and
Indo-China. Germany has acquired three
wide dominions in Africa, and has begun
to appropriate points of vantage else-
where. Meanwhile, the United States,
which in 1798 had only just begun to
spread out her population behind the Al-
leghanies, has now filled the Mississippi
Valley, developed the best parts of the
Rocky Mountain plateau, and established
populous and flourishing communities
along more than a thousand miles of
the Pacific coast; having, moreover, to
the south of her, all the way to Cape
Horn, states of only second or third rate
strength.
	These five nations have now become
world powers in a new sense of the
word, each  but especially Russia, Brit-
ain, and the United States  holding a
considerable fraction of the total area of
the world. So far as we can foresee,
it is in the hands of these five powers
that the destiny of the world as a whole
will lie, so much stronger are they than
any of their competitors.
	The great stage is now almost cleared
of minor actors, and each of the five
great nations looks round on the others,
measuring their respective strength, con-
jecturing their respective purposes, and
considering what will be the future rela-
tions of each to each. Of the four Eu-
ropean powers, no one has any special
affinity for any other. They are mnutu-
ally jealous, and two of them are even
hostile to one another. The alliance of
Russia and France is not an alliance of
natural friendship or sympathy, but is
based on the feelings which France en-
tertains toward Germany, and is, more-
over, threatened by the divergence of
interests and of traditional policy in the
Turkish East, which has been a factor in
the past, and may reappear as a factor
once more.
	England has no reason for hostility
with any other power. She possesses at
least as much territory as she can hope
successfully to defend, administer, and
develop. Despite the excited language
in which some of her writers and speak-
ers occasionally indulge, her people as a
whole desire peace and friendship with
all other states, and feel that the duty
that lies before them is rather to dis-
charge well their existing responsibili-
ties than to seek the further extension
of those responsibilities. Nevertheless,
England feels that she is regarded by
the other three powers  whether justly
or unjustly I will not now inquire 
with a jealousy which might readily pass
into unfriendliness. She perceives that
these powers think their interests opposed
to hers, although, in truth, peace, confi-
dence, and unshackled commerce are the
highest interest of all countries.
	In this state of facts, England has
been forced to look round and consider
with which of the four other world
powers she has most natural affinity,
and with which of them there is the
least likelihood of any clash of interests.
That one is unquestionably the United
States. We in England have always</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00030" SEQ="0030" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="24">24	The Essential Unity of Britain and America.

believed that the special mission of the
United States was to build up a vast
free, industrious, enlightened, and pro-
sperous community in her magnificent
domain between the two oceans, and to
set to other peoples an example of or-
derly self-government, and the elevation
of the masses of the people to the high-
est point yet attained of material well-
being and intellectual development.
This is a task sufficient to employ the
energy of the United States for gener-
ations to come; and some of us have
thought that it will ultimately be accom-
panied by the extension of her influence
over the Spanish states of Central and
South America, reclaiming those regions
from misgovernment or barbarism by
an infiltration of the surplus population
of North America. We have never be-
lieved that Canada would raise a dispute
between the United.States and Britain,
because to seize Canada against the will
of the Canadian people would be utterly
opposed to the first principle of Ameri-
can policy, while to retain a self-govern-
ing colony by force against the will of
its people would be no less inconsistent
with British policy. We have therefore
held that the United States would con-
tinue to think that she had all the ter-
ritory she needed. If, however, she
should desire to acquire such a transma-
rine dominion as the Philippine Islands,
we should see no possible ground for ob-
jection by Britain to such an act. Some
of us who know the United States, and
love her next to our own country, might
think such a step fraught with future
difficulties, and might regret it in the
interest of the United States herself.
But Britain would regard it, so far as
her own political and commercial posi-
tion was concerned, with nothing but sat-
isfaction. Thus the English have seen,
and see to-day, no ground for a collision
of political interests between themselves
and the American repubiic~ and when
they study the chessboard of the world
they feel the contrast J~etween her posi
tion toward them and that of the powers
of Continental Europe.
	That narrowing of the world, how-
ever, whereof I have spoken, and the
sudden prominence upon its stage of a
few great powers and races, has had an-
other effect. It has intensified the self-
consciousness and the patriotism of each
of the races, rousing in each a stronger
sentiment of the unity of the race and
of the splendor of the part it has to
play. Each recalls with a keener pride
its achievements in the past; each is
more eager to sustain its greatness in
the future. Now, although there are
five great world powers, there are only
four great world races; for one of the
races has embodied itself in two powers,
and has built up the North American
republic and the oceanic empire of Brit-
ain. There has indeed been a large in-
fusion of other elements into the popula-
tion of the United States, but those ele-
ments are mostly drawn from the same
sources, Teutonic and Celtic, which form
the population of the British Isles, and
all have been, or are being, moulded into
the same normal American type. That
type differs less from the normal British
type than the Englishman of Hamnp-
shire differs from the Scotchman of Fife
or the Irishman of Galway; and the
differences which separate the average
Englishman and the average American
are as nothing in comparison with those
which separate either of them from
members of any of the other great races~
The influences of climate and institu-
tions which tend to differentiate them
are less potent than the influences of lit-
erature and thought which tend to as-
similation. Here in England, at any
rate, we never think of natives of the
United States as different from our-
selves, and when we speak of foreign-
ers we do not include Americans. Ac-
cordingly, whenever we think of what is
called  the term may not be a correct
one, but it is the best we have  the
Anglo-Saxon race, to which we belong,</PB>

we think of it as a whole, though it
dwells on opposite sides of the Atlantic.
We think of it as one race, one in char-
acter, in temper, in habits, in beliefs, in
ideals. That intensified race conscious-
ness which the rivalry of the other great
races has produced, that feeling of pride
in the occupation and development of the
earths surface which has grown with the
keener competition of recent years, have
deepened the sense of solidarity in the
scattered members of the race, and drawn
Englishmen nearer and nearer to the
great branch in the United States, now
larger than their own, as well as the
smaller branches in Canada and Austra-
lasia. Thus it is not with jealousy, but
with admiration and sympathy, that the
extraordinary progress of the United
States in wealth, power, and population
has been regarded by the great mass of
our people. They have thought of the
two countries as partners and fellow
workers in securing the ascendency of
the language, the free institutions, the
ideas, which they themselves cherish, and
with whose power and progress they be-
lieve the future welfare of humanity to
be involved.
	To any one who remembers the days
of the war of secession the contrast be-
tween the sentiment of Britain then and
the sentiment now is very striking. It is
true that even in 1863  and this is a
fact not realized in America as it deserves
to be  the masses of the people hoped
for the victory of the North, because
they felt that the North stood for human
rib hts and freedom. Those who advo-
cated the Southern cause never ventured
to hold an open public meeting, while
hundreds of such meetings were held to
send good wishes to those who fought
against slavery. But it must be admit-
ted that the bulk of the wealthier classes
of England, and the newspapers writ-
ten for those classes, did in those days
say many offensive things regarding the
United States, and sometimes conveyed
the impression  erroneous though that
impression was  that England as a
whole had ranged herself on the side
which every one now admits to have
been adverse to the progress of the world
and to the welfare of the South itself.
Why did the wealthier English class err
so grievously? Partly from ignorance,
for in those days the United States were
little understood in Europe; partly from
its own political proclivities, which were
not generally for freedom. But since
1863 Britain has passed through great
political changes. The parliamentary
suffrage has been so extended as now
to include the immense majority of the
working classes, both in town and in
country. Members are far more obser-
vant of the wishes of their constituents,
far more anxious to consult and regard
them, than they were in the old days.
The political influence of great landown-
ers has almost disappeared. Many laws
have been passed for the benefit of the
laboring man which no one dreamed of
in 1863. Britain has in fact become
virtually a democracy, though the affec-
tion and reverence felt for the present
sovereign have made the Crown niore
popular than ever. Britain is indeed in
some points more democratic than the
United States, for her legislature is not
restrained by any such constitutional
provisions as limit the powers of Con-
gress. Thus there has come about a
notable change in the tone of British
public opinion. In 1863 the masses of
the English people were with Mr. Lin-
coln, but their sentiment told very lit-
tle on the wealthy and the newspapers
which the wealthy read. Now the masses
have become politically predominant, and
public opinion has adapted itself to the
new conditions. The old fear and jeal-
ousy of democratic institutions have van-
ished, because these institutions have
come, and have obviously come to stay.
So far from being dreaded as a fountain
of democratic propaganda, America is
looked on as a champion of popular gov-
ernment against the great military mon</PB>

archies of Continental Europe, and as
the only great country which, like Brit-
ain, has recognized that the freedom of
the individual citizen as against the offi-
cial is the basis of all truly free govern-
ment. Accordingly, one chief cause of
that change in the ruling sentiment of
England toward America, which in 1898
has rejoiced those of us who remember
1863, is the change in the political con-
ditions of England herself.
	There remains one other force which
has drawn the two peoples together, and
it is perhaps the most hopeful of all, be-
cause it is independent of material in-
terests and of politics. It is the better
knowledge which they are coming to have
of each other. The habit of travel has
prodigiously increased within the last
forty years. Americans come over in
thousands, not only for business, but for
pleasure, and find themselves more at
home in England than they did before.
Englishmen go in far larger numbers to
the United States, for instruction and
pleasure as well as for business, and
return with more accurate ideas about
the United States than they had before.
Each man diffuses these ideas in his
own circle, and thus the whole natiou
has come to know its Western kinsfolk
in a perfectly new way, and in a way in
which it does not and cannot know any
nation of the European continent. In
former days each people drew its im-
pressions of the other from the action
of the government and the language of
the newspapers; and both the action of
the government and the language of the
newspapers tended to misrepresent each
to the other. Governments are brought
into contact by differences; and they are
obliged to deal with matters of differ-
ence in a cold, dry way. Each tries to
drive a hard bargain; each gives its
views in dispatches which are in sub-
stance, sometimes even in style, much like
the letters written by attorneys on be-
half of their contending clients. Each
is in danger of importing into its diplo
macy the manner and methods of party
politics; and the methods of party poli-
tics do not tend to amenity or good feel-
111g. Newspapers, on the other hand,
which might have been thought a better
index of popular sentiment, are prone
to dwell on points of difference more
than on points of agreement. It is per-
haps easier, it is certainly more tempt-
ing, to carp and cavil and satirize than
it is to praise; and the journalist is apt
to think that his talent and his vigor are
better displayed in sharp criticism than
in kindly appreciation. Besides, it is,
unluckily, the bitter things that are said
in one country about another that are
most frequently copied into the news-
papers of the latter. Here in Europe
half the ill feeling that exists between
the nations is due to the goadings of the
press, though our own (if an Englishman
may be permitted to say so) is in this
respect less blameworthy than the jour-
nalism of France or Germany or Russia.
But every one who knows the educated
class in any country will agree that the
tone of its feeling toward other coun-
tries is more generous, more friendly,
more large-minded, than could be ga-
thered either from the action of its gov-
eminent or from the columns of its news-
papers. It is therefore an immense gain
that Englishmen and Americans are now
learning to know one another through
direct personal contact, and that the spir-
it of that cordial welcome which a man
from either country finds when he travels
in the other is coming to be recognized
as the real and genuine spirit which ani-
mates both nations; and after a recent
visit to Canada, I will venture to say that
this is now the prevailing spirit among
Canadians also.
	This truer insight has enabled us in
England to realize the substantial iden-
tity of thought and feeling between the
two peoples. Let me take as an exam-
ple the way in which the most terrible
event of recent times impressed them
both. The massacres of the. Eastern</PB>

Christians which took place in 1895 and
1896 excited little commiseration, little
indignation, in Continental Europe. The
press in Germany and France and Aus-
tria, guided by the wishes or hints or
commands of the governments of those
states, did its best to conceal the facts
from the public. A few noble and ear-
nest men, mostly Roman Catholic priests
or Protestant pastors, in France, in Ger-
many, and in Switzerland, appealed to
their fellow countrymen to move the gov-
ernments to interfere and to send help
to the sufferers. But their voices found
only a faint response. Far otherwise
in Britain and in the United States.
The governments of both those coun-
tries did indeed attempt, or accomplish,
much less than was hoped and wished.
But the peoples were stirred by a hor-
ror and an anger which pervaded every
class. Untrammeled by any considera-
tions of political expediency, their hearts
spoke out in the cause of justice, hu-
manity, and freedom; for they believed
that it is justice, humanity, and freedom
that ought to guide the policy of nations.
Here, as in so many other instances, it
was shown how unlike their neighbors in
Continental Europe, and how like their
kinsfolk in America, the British are.
It is in this community of ideas and feel-
ings, this similarity of instinctive judg-
ments, that the unity of the peoples best
appears. The sense of identity has deep-
er and better foundations than the pride
of Anglo-Saxon ancestry and the spirit
of defiance to other races.
	The circumstances of the friction occa-
sioned by the Venezuela boundary ques-
tion toward the end of 1895 illustrate
the way in which the sentiment of friend-
liness had ripened in Britain. The Pre-
sidents message and the action of Con-
gress were received in this country with
amazement. Few persons had the least
idea that any serious disagreement be-
tween the two governments would or
could arise over a matter which had at-
tracted no attention here. With the
shock of surprise there was a shock of
grief that Congress should apparently
treat lightly a contingency so lamentable
as a collision between the two nations.
But there was no outbreak of hostile
feeling toward the United States. The
general feeling was that there must be
a great misconception somewhere, and
that, so far as national honor permit-
ted, every step ought to be taken to re-
move the misconception, and set mat-
ters right between nations made to be
friends. Very shortly afterward, there
occurred, on the part of a great Con-
tinental state, what our people deemed
a provocation. It was resented with a
promptitude and a warmth in excess of its
real importance, but which showed how
different was the sentiment which the
words of a Continental power, thereto-
fore friendly, excited from that which
prevailed where our own kinsfolk were
concerned. And (unless my recollection
is at fault) the possibility of some joint ac-
tion of European powers directed against
Britain immediately caused a revulsion
of opinion in the United States in favor
of Britain, like that which softens a mans
heart toward a relative with whom he
has had a coolness, so soon as lie finds
that the relative is threatened from some
other quarter.
	The alliances of nations are usually
based upon interest alone, and last no
longer than the cause which has pro-
duced them. A coincidence, or at least
an absence of any conflict, of interest is
the almost indispensable condition of
cordial relations. But when other ties
than those of common material benefit
exist, their existence may give to those
relations a greatly increased strength
and permanence; just as, if one may
compare great things with small, a part-
nership in business succeeds better and
lasts longer when its members have a
personal regard for and a personal trust
in one another. Now the United States
and Britain have nowhere in the world
any conflicting interests. They have in</PB>

some directions identical interests, as for
instance in the maintenance of open
markets for their goods. They are in
some respects complementary to each
other; for while the United States is the
great food - raising and cotton - growing
country of the world, Britain is the
great consumer of sea-borne food and of
raw cotton; and as the one is rapidly be-
coming the chief among the producers
of the world both in the agricultural and
in the mineral department, so the other
is by her mercantile marine the chief dis-
tributer. Each has the strongest inter-
est in the welfare of the other; and we
have repeatedly seen how powerfully the
commercial prosperity or depression of
the one tells on the trade of the other.
Thus there exists, as regards political
interest, a basis for the establishment of
the most close and cordial relations be-
tween the two countries,  a basis inde-
pendent of the chances and changes of
the moment, because it is due to perma-
nent conditions. But above and beyond
this coincidence of interests there is the
community of blood, the similarity of in-
stitutions, and that capacity for under-
standing and appreciating one another
which is given by a common tongue and
by habits of thought and feeling essential-
ly the same. Nature and history have
made each profoundly concerned in the
well-being of the other. No true Amer-
ican could see without the deepest grief
the humiliation and suffering of the an-
cestral home of his race. No true Eng-
lishman but would mourn any grave dis-
aster that could befall the people which
it is one of the chief glories of England
to have reared and planted. Seventeen
years ago, in addressing an American
audience, I ventured to express the be-
lief that if ever England was hard
pressed by a combination of hostile Eu-
ropean powers America would not stand
by idle and unconcerned, and the re-
ception given to those words confirmed
my belief. The sympathy of race does
not often affect the relations of states,
but when it does it is a force of tremen-
dous potency; for it affects not so much
governments as the people themselves,
who, both in America and in England,
are the ultimate depositaries of power,
the ultimate controllers of policy.
	War between two nations is a deplor-
able event, whatever the causes arid the
circumstances. But as evil sometimes
comes out of good, so events which in
themselves are unfortunate may become
the parents of good. Thus the outbreak
of hostilities between the United States
and Spain gave occasion for the display of
a feeling in England, not against Spain,
but of interest in the United States,
which was riot only general, but conspic-
uously spontaneous. It was the sudden
and indisputable evidence of a sentiment
we believed to exist, but which had never
before been made so manifest. It was
promptly and heartily reciprocated in
the United States. And now many voices
have been asking what durable expres-
sion can be given to this feeling shared
by the two peoples, and to what account,
permanently helpful to both, it can be
turned. As Mr. Olney has pointed out,
in the thoughtful and weighty article
which he contributed to the May num-
ber of The Atlantic Monthly (an article
whose friendly tone has been cordially
appreciated in England), there are some
obvious difficulties in the way of a for-
mal alliance. Those difficulties are not
insurmountable, and if such an alliance
were ultimately to be formed, instead of
threatening other states it would be a
guarantee of peace to the world; for
each nation would feel itself bound to
justify its policy to the public opinion of
the other. Meantime, there are things
which may be done at once to cement
and perpetuate the good relations which
happily prevail. One is the conclusion
of a general arbitration treaty, providing
for the amicable settlement of all differ-
ences which may hereafter arise between
the nations. Another is the agreement
to render services to each other: such,

for instance, as giving to a citizen of
either nation a right to invoke the good
offices of the diplomatic or consular re-
presentatives of the other in a place
where his own government has no repre-
sentative; or such as the recognition of
a common citizenship, securing to the
citizens of each, in the country of the
other, certain rights not enjoyed by oth-
er foreigners. But the greatest thing of
all is that the two peoples should real-
ize, as we may hope they are now com-
ing to do, that whether or no they have a
formal alliance, they may have a league
of the heart; that the sympathy of each
is a tower of strength to the other; that
the best and surest foundation of the fu-
ture policy of each is to be found in re-
lations of frank and cordial friendship
with the other.

of it; whatever defections may occur, it
is unmanly for Americans to be faint-
hearted. When all is said that can be
said, democracy exhibits no disadvan-
tages which cannot at once be paralleled
or surpassed in the experience of aristo-
cracies and monarchies. In an Anglo-
Saxon community, inheriting as it does
the traditions of two thousand years of
self - government, the people cau and
ought to take care of themselves; and
it is culpable faint-heartedness to believe
that the elements other than Anglo-Saxon
which have flowed in upon us have so
far canceled or emasculated Anglo-Saxon
virility that we need to be taken in hand
by a master.
	Unquestionably, a state of depend-
ence during the first century and a half
of America was a salutary, indeed an
indispensable thing. During the early
days a powerful foe might at any time
easily have wiped out the English colo-
nies; the tenure hung upon a very light
thread. As time advanced, and France,
during the reigns of Louis XIV. and
Louis XV., became ambitious in Amer-
ica, the peril from the foreign power was
imminent. However well the provinces
may sometimes have fought the French,
they were utterly unable of their own
strength to keep the foreigner at bay.
Even the capture of Louisburg, the most
conspicuous military feat of the provin-
cials, could never have been achieved
without the support of the British fleet.
In the hard campaigns that followed, the
provincials played a very secondary part;
often enough, the French, with their In-
dian allies, were on the threshold of suc-
cess. The line of posts stretching from
New Orleans to Quebec was in the way
to be strongly confirmed, and the disunit-
ed and discouraged populations scattered
along the seaboard seemed on the point
of subjection. When Braddock failed,
when Montcalrn won at Ticonderoga,
when Pontiac threatened Detroit, all was
precarious for English America. But
at last British soldiers under General
Forbes captured Fort Duquesne; British
soldiers under Colonel Bouquet broke the
Indian spirit at Bushy Run; British sol-
diers, again, under Wolfe won at Quebec,
 and after that everything was secure~
We scarcely realize to-day how precari-
ous the Anglo-Saxon hold upon America
was up to the capture of Quebec. Says
an intelligent writer: The conjunction
of the genius of Pitt and the genius of
Wolfe was almost miraculous, and that
conjunction alone it was that ruined the
cause of France. 1 It was only by a
hairs breadth that America was saved to
the Anglo-Saxons. The colonies alone, at
this time, poor and without cohesion, were
quite powerless to cope with the danger.
But for their dependence upon the arm
of the mother country they would have
been lost.
	The necessity for this dependence
came to an end through the conquest of
Pitt and Wolfe; but the habit had been
formed, and was slow in yielding. When,
a little later, under the initiative of Sam-
uel Adams, independence became a pop-
ular cry, it was only after long hesita-
tion, and in spite of the resistance of a
mass of the best people of tile country,
who were never able to see that inde-
pendence had become expedient. But
the time had come for America to enter
upon the second phase in her evolution.
The Anglo - Saxon schism came to
pass. Shall we say with Mr. Egerton,
and with many another good English-
man whose heart yearns toward the bre-
thren who became estranged, that it was
one of the most calamitous events in
the worlds history? While reciprocat-
ing the brotherly yearning, Americans
should think that no mistake was made;
it is well that the schism came. A peo-
ple sprang into being tile breath of whose
nostrils became, instead of provincialism,
the noblest national spirit.
	To use a figure no homelier, perhaps,
than that of the raft, which Emerson

takes so approvingly from Fisher Ames,
a political construction for a vast mul-
titude should be after the model of the
bob-sled of the lumberman of the
Northwest. If the vehicle were in one
frame, the load pressing from above and
the inequalities of the road beneath
would rack it to pieces at once; let there
be runners, however, before and behind,
each pair distinct and independent, yet
linked by appliances always flexible but
never parting, all immediately goes well.
Among the stumps and gullies of time
rough track, the contrivance, readily
yielding, yet never disconnected, easily
bears on its weight of timber; the short-
est corners are turned, the ugliest drifts
surmounted. That Anglo - Saxondom
was sundered is not a subject for regret.
In one frame, so to speak, it could not do
its work. That its burden might be well
and safely borne the division into two
was salutary, indeed inevitable. What.
is to be regretted is that the severance
involved bloodshed, and produced a ha-
tred which rankles yet. The split should
not be utter. While the two frames are
separate an indestructible link should
connect them, allowing to each free play
while making the two after all one.
	But without stopping to consider a
proposition to us so obvious as the bene-
fit to America herself of becoming in-
dependent, let us inquire for a moment
as to the effect of the American revolt
elsewhere than at home. Charles James
Fox is said to have exclaimed once,
The resistance of the Americans to the
oppression of the mother country has
undoubtedly preserved the liberties of
mankind! If such a declaration ap-
pears too sweeping, the value of the
American revolt as regards the British
empire, at any rate, can scarcely be ex-
aggerated. How has it come to pass
that the magnificent freedom to-day al-
lowed to the dependencies of England
exists? Englishmen have ascribed it
directly to the circumstance that the
mother country learned wisdom from her
fiery experience with America. Her eyes
were opened to what was and what was
not possible, and it is directly as a con-
sequence of the American struggle that
she has finally established it as a prin-
ciple that colonies are to be left to them-
selves. America by conquering secured
not only her own freedom, but probably
that of her fellow dependencies,  those
then existing and those afterward to be
established.
	Perhaps still more than this can be
said: did not the resistance of America
save England herself? Buckle, in his
History of Civilization, speaking of the
danger to England, one hundred years
ago, through the encroachments upon her
liberty of royal and aristocratic power,
says: The danger was so imminent as
to make the ablest defenders of popular
liberty believe that everything was at
stake, and that if the Americans were
vanquished the next step would be to at-
tack the liberties of England, and en-
deavor to extend to the mother country
the same arbitrary government which
by that time would have been established
in the colonies. . . . The danger was
far more serious than men are now in-
clined to believe. During many years
the authority of the Crown continued to
increase, until it reached a height of
which no example had been seen in Eng-
land for several generations. - . . There
is no doubt, I think, that the American
war was a great crisis in the history of
England, and that if the colonists had
been defeated our liberties for a time
would have been in considerable jeopardy.
From that risk we were saved by the
Americans, who with heroic spirit resist-
ed the royal armies. ~

	But is there not something higher for
nations than independence? We are
members one of another, the apostolic
admonition, deserves heed from states
as well as individuals. The wise and
benevolent look forward to Tennysons

Parliament of man, the federation of
the world; and as a first step toward
that happy consummation, what can be
better than that among nations like should
connect itself with like? There is no
other kinship among peoples so marked
as that between the two great branches
of the English-speaking race.
	The notion of Anglo-Saxon brother-
hood ought to have some interest for
Americans. Says Sir Louis Mallet, ren-
dering an idea of Cobden: Codpera-
tion, and not competition, international
interdependence, and not national inde-
pendence, are the highest end and object
of civilization. The suggestion of Sir
Edwin Arnold, made to President Har-
rison, was that there should be an inter-
national council to arbitrate all matters
in dispute, from whose decisions there
should be no appeal, and this within a
year or two has seemed not far from re-
alization. Such a scheme would be a
loose kind of federation; and as far as a
formal bond is concerned, without doubt
it would be all that is expedient. As
to a union, only one purely moral is pos-
sible or desirable. For some such clasp.
ing of hands the world is certainly ripe.
Through steam and electricity, time and
space are annihilated. The seas no long-
er divide, but unite. Should the will for
such fraternity be felt, there is no power
of nature or man which could interfere
to prevent. Had we but the will! We
nurse too carefully old prejudices; we re-
member too long ancient injuries. We
train our children as we were trained
ourselves, to execrate all things British,
and to think only of Englands tyranny.
We ought to know that in the Revolution
possibly half of England were really on
our side, regarding our cause as their
own, and that the descendants of the
great masses who felt with us, prayed for
us, and rejoiced in our success now hold
England in their own hands.

	This view is so unfamiliar to Ameri-
cans that it well deserves illustration.
	It is not right to regard George III.
as a fair representative of the England
of his time, nor to think that in the
great war of the American Revolution,
of which, on the British side, he w~ s
the central figure, Americans were really
fighting England. Says the Westminster
Review: Of course Americans regard
independence as their great achievement.
In this they are quite right. When,
however, they proceed to regard inde-
pendence as a victory gained over Eng-
land, their enemy, they are surely egre-
giously in error. . . . At the time the
United States were fighting for inde-
pendence, England was fighting for her
liberties: the common enemy was the
Hanoverian George III. and his Ger-
manized court. . . . When the news was
brought to London that the United States
had appealed to arms, William Pitt, an
Englishman if there ever was one, rose
in his seat in Parliament, and with up-
lifted voice thanked God that the Amer-
ican colonists retained enough of Eng-
lish blood to fight for their rights. Nine
Englishmen out of every ten outside of
court influence similarly rejoiced. In-
dependence Day is as much a red-letter
day for every genuine Englishman as
for every genuine American. And so it
should be. Washington but trod in the
footsteps of Hampden. His task was
easier than that of Hampden, and the
solution he wrought, which an interval
of three thousand miles of ocean practi-
cally dictated, was more thorough. 2
	Vast misapprehension as to the true
character of the American Revolution no
doubt prevails. The English radical
whose words have been quoted puts the
case none too strongly. A high Ameri-
can authority declares that the Ameri-
can Revolution was not a quarrel be-
tween two peoples, but a strife between

two parties in one people, conservatives
and liberals. These parties existed in
both countries; the battle between them
was waged not only on the fields of
America, but in the British Parliament
also,  some of the fiercest engagements
in the latter arena. The strife took
place on both sides of the water, with
nearly equal step, and was essentially
the same on both sides; so that if, at
the close of the French war, all the peo-
ple of Great Britain had been transport-
ed to America, and all the people of
America to Great Britain, and put in
control of British affairs, the American
Revolution and the contemporary Brit-
ish Revolution might have gone on just
the same, and with the same final re-
suit.
	As to the embarrassments which the
king and his ministers underwent from
a powerful opposition, in their attempts
to coerce America, the best historian of
the eighteenth century makes out a strong
case. At first the immense influence of
Pitt, soon to be Earl of Chatham, then
the most powerful of snbjects, was on the
side of America. He justified with all
his eloquence the resistance to the Stamp
Act, seconded by Lord Camden, who also
had great influence. At the time of the
tea duty there was in Parliament a strong
section supporting the Americans, and
outside of Parliament a still more de-
mocratic party who kept the country in
alarm through fierce political agitation,
 all which, as was truly said by Lord
North, lured on America and blocked the
efforts of the ministry.
	In another sphere, the tried and
skillful soldiers, Amherst, Conway, and
Barr6, did not conceal their sympathy.
In the House of Commons Fox eulogized
Montgomery, slain at Quebec; while the
Duke of Richmond said in the House of
Lords, after Bunker Hill, that the Amer-

icans were not in rebellion, bnt resisting
acts of the most unexampled cruelty and
oppression. The gleeful exclamation of
Horace Walpole, somewhat later, over
the surrender of Burgoyne, and the de-
claration of his belief that the Americans
were better Englishmen than the English
themselves, is very significant. Thank
God, said he, old England is safe. I

the House of Commons the American
army was spoken of as our army. Wil-
liam Pitt, in 1781, called the attempt to
reduce America most accursed, wicked,
barbarous, cruel, unnatural, diabolical.
In the ruling class, a minority contain-
ing personages of the highest rank and
the ablest men in the nation had identi-
fied itself completely with the insurgents.
They resisted with passion, for they came
to feel  a feeling which writers like
Buckle declare thoroughly justified 
that the defeat of the Americans would
probably be followed by a subversion of
the constitution of England. Meantime,
among the people, the war was to the
last degree unpopular. London was
sometimes at the mercy of mobs; the
army could be maintained only by press-
gangs, by emptying into the regiments
the prisons, and by buying Hessians.
	If the king and his ministers were
embarrassed by an opposition, the Amer-
ican patriots were no less embarrassed.
An energetic minority, it has been said,
brought to pass the Revolution, which,
proceeding especially from New England,
was carried through in spite of a majority
in the colonies,  a majority in great
part quite apathetic, but to some extent
actively resisting.3 The emigration of
Tories, when the day was at last won,
was relatively as great as that of the Hu-
guenots from France after the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes. The total num

her is estimated to have been at least one
hundred thousand. In this multitude
were comprised only such, with their fam-
ilies, as had been active for the king.
The indifferent, who had lent no helping
hand to the patriots, must have been a
multitude much larger; these remained
behind, inertly submitting to the new or-
der of things as they had swayed inertly
this way or that, following the power and
direction of the blast of war.
	The war of the American Revolution,
then, was a strife, not of countries, but
of parties ; a strife carried on both in
England and in America,  bloodless in
the motherland, bloody in the depend-
ency; but nevertheless a strife carried
on in each arena for the preservation
of the same priceless treasure,  Anglo-
Saxon freedom,  and fought through
with similar spirit. On one side of
the Atlantic victory came speedily. In
America there were no traditions and
institutions, rooted for centuries, to be
upturned; and besides, there came most
timely help from France. Victory in
America drew necessarily with it vic-
tory in England. It has long been de-
layed, but it has been steadily coming,
until at the present moment, as regards
popular freedom, the two countries stand
nearly together,  England, perhaps,
though preserving monarchical forms and
much social feudalism, really in advance.
Popular freedom was possibly saved to
England by the success of the American
struggle; on the other hand, America has
derived that popular freedom nowhere
hut from the motherland, through the
struggles of her Alfred; of her Lang-
ton and the barons of 1215; of her Earl
Simon; of her knights of the shire, her
Ironsides, her supporters of the Bill of
Rights. What a noble community is this,
 common striving so heroic for a com-
mon cause of such supreme moment!

between lands so linked; how powerful

the motive to join hand with hand, and
heart with heart!
	England is not only herself, at the pre-
sent hour, practically a democratic repub-
lic, but is the parent of vast republics in
the quarters of the earth most distant
from her. In America, Australia, and
Africa, enormous tracts of territory, best
adapted by climate and soil to the habita-
tion of Europeans, are in the possession,
and have become the seats, of vigorous
and growing Anglo-Saxon peoples. The
extent to which these have become en-
dowed with the ancient freedom so thor-
oughly recovered by the motherland can
be made plain in a few words. The old
colonial empire, the thirteen colonies,
which, after revolting, became the United
States, had been ruled after the prece-
dents of Spain. The dependencies were
regarded as a source from which the
motherland might be enriched, and their
interests were neglected and sacrificed in
the pursuit by the motherland of this self-
ish end. Till alienated by the behavior
of England, the colonists had far more
kindly feelings toward her than she had
toward them. To them she was the old
home; to her they were simply custom-
ers. 2 Exasperation in the colonies was
the inevitable fruit of so base a policy,
and in the end England, like Spain, lost
the new lands whose rights she had
abused. The bitter experience, as we
have seen, perhaps saved her own free-
dom; she derived from it also the wis-
dom which enabled her, when presently
the vast new colonial empire fell within
her grasp, so to proceed that the depend-
encies, instead of chafing under their
bond, cherish it with warm affection, look-
ing upon independence as a calamity ra-
ther than a blessing.
	The work of our fathers, then, was to
sever the English-speaking world,  a
work one hundred years ago most noble
and necessary to be done, for only so, in
that day, could freedom be saved. At

the present time, however, may it not
be the case that the work to be done is
not of severance, but of union?
	John Bright wrote, in 1887, to the com-
mittee for the celebration of the centen-
nial of the American Constitution: As
you advance in the second century of
your natural life, may we not ask that our
two nations may become one people?
	Sir Henry Parkes, perhaps the fore-
most statesman of Australia, addressing
the legislature of New South Wales, No-
vember 25, 1887, said still more definite-
ly: I firmly believe it is within the
range of human probability that the great
groups of free communities connected
with England will, in separate federa-
tions, be united to the mother country;
	and I also believe that in all rea-
sonable probability, by some less distinct
bond, even the United States of America
will be connected with this great Eng-
lish-speaking congeries of free govern-
ments. I believe the circumstances of
the world will develop some such new
complex nationality as this, in which each
of the parts will be free and independent
while united in one grand whole, which
~vill civilize the globe.
	Sir George Grey, at different times
governor of West Australia, of New Zea-
land, and of South Africa, one of the
most illustrious of the men who have de-
veloped for England her great posses-
sions in the South Pacific, contemplates
an eventuni though perhaps far-off league
between members of the English-speak-
ing race, in which the United States will
not only be included, but, displacing Eng-
land, will become the leader.
	The declarations of Joseph Chamber-
lain, of a spirit similar to those of the
statesmen just quoted, are at the present
hour agitating Europe.
	Gladstone once wrote : 
If love unite, wide space divides in vain,
And bands may clasp across the flowing
main.

That clasp of bands Gladsj;one could not
live to bring to pass; but though he is
gone, we are not therefore without re-
source.
	Among Americans Edward Atkinson
has declared: The two great branches
of the English-speaking people, political-
ly separated by the misconceptions of a
small faction which governed England
during the latter part of the last century,
are becoming more and more reunited
through their interdependence. Their
wants and their supplies are the comple-
inents of each other. . .. The time is not
far distant when the control of commerce,
passing more completely than ever to
the English-speaking people of the world,
will bring them into closer union, each
branch maintaining its own form and
system of government, but all working
together for the benefit of all who share
in the abundance of their products.
	The idea of some reconstitution of the
family bond has found expression more
often from citizens of the British Empire
than from Americans, though men are
not wanting in America in whose minds
has arisen the conception of doing away
with the Anglo-Saxon schism as a thing
possible and to be wished for. The pre-
vailing mood among us, however, has
been that of self-sufficiency. Absorbed
with problems and interests that seem
nearer, we have let the broad thought go.
	But if the reader has followed with any
sympathy and attention the view held in
this paper, he will be prepared to see that
if we form a link anywhere, our proper
affiliation is with England and her chil-
dren scattered east and ~vest. There are
indeed to-day, as there were in the time
of the American Revolution, two Eng-
lands and two Americas. Of one ~Eng-
land Lord Dundreary is the type; as of
one America the appropriate type is the
tuft - hunting daughter of the I)lutocrat,
who will sell soul and body to get Lord
Dundreary for a husband. There is, be-
sides, the stalwart, manful England, for
which stand Gladstone, John Bright, nnd
James Bryce; as there are in America

THE DECADENCE OF SPAIN.

	WHEN Charles V. was obliged to re-
nounce the dream of a nuiversal mon-
archy, and to abandon the Holy Roman
Empire to his brother Ferdinand, he
was still able to make over to his son
Philip II. territories which rendered

Spain was the dread of the nations, and
its destruction was the cherished object
of statesmen for a century. It was not
by their efforts, however, that the result
was accomplished. Olivares, it is true,
was overmatclied by Richelieu, but Spain
had a vantage - ground enabling her to
hold her own against external assault.
The causes of her decadence were inter-
nal; they were numerous, but may be
roughly defined as springing from pride,
conservatism, and clericalism.
	There is a pride which spurs nations
on to great achievements, which reckons
nothing done while aught remains to do,
and which wisely adapts means to ends.
Such was not the pride of Spain: it was
proud of what it had done, and imagined
that its superiority to the rest of the
world left it nothing more to do; it could
learn nothing and forget nothing; it had
varied the centuries of the Reconquest
with endless civil broils, while it left
the arts of peace to subject Moors and
Jews, until honest labor was regarded
with disdain, and trade and commerce
were treated in a barbarous fashion that
choked all the springs of national pro-
sperity. Derived from this blind and
impenetrable pride was the spirit of
conservatism which rejected all innova-
tion in a world of incessant change, a
world which had been sent by the Re-
formation spinning on a new track, a
world in which modern industrialism was
rapidly superseding the obsolescent mil-
itarism of Spain. The phrase current
throughout Europe in the last century
was not without foundation, that Africa
be0an at the Pyrenees. Last, but by no
means least, was the clericalism which
developed in Spain the ferocious spirit
of intolerance; which in 1492 drove out
the unhappy Jews, and in 1610 the Mo-
riscos, thus striking at the root of the
commercial prosperity and industry of
the land; and which surrendered the
nation to the Inquisition, paralyzing all
intellectual movement, crippling trade,
and keeping the people so completely in
leading-strings that the three generations
since the Napoleonic upheaval have not
sufficed for their training in the arts of
self-government.
	Yet the Spaniard has qualities which,
if not thus counterbalanced, ought to
have assured him a maintenance of the
commanding position which he held in
the sixteenth century. His intellect is
strong and quick, his imagination is vivid,
and, before the censorship of the Inqui-
sition had curbed its expression, his lit-
erature was the most promising in Eu-
rope. When fully aroused his perse-
verance is indefatigable. His courage
is undoubted,  not a merely evanescent
valor, flaming up on occasion at the pro-
mise of success, but a persistent, obsti-
nate, dogged quality, to be dreaded as
much in defeat as in victory, and sus-
tained by the pride of race which leads
him to think all other races his infe-
riors. The unyielding steadfastness of
the Spanish tercios on the disastrous
field of Rocroy was paralleled in the de-
fense of Saragossa. The exploits of the
Conquistadores in the New World dis-
play a tenacity of daring amid unknown
dangers which has rarely been equaled,
and perhaps never surpassed. The prac-
tical efficiency of this determined valor is
heightened, moreover, by a remarkable
callous indifference as to the means to be
employed in accomplishing a given pur-
pose. Spanish legislation is full of the
sternest laws, enacted in utter disregard
of their contingent and ulterior conse-
quences provided the immediate object
in view can he effected. Alvas reign of
blood in the Netherlands is typical of
this fierce and cold-blooded determina-
tion to achieve a result at whatever cost
of life and suffering, and the reconcen-
trado policy of Weyler is only a modern
exhibition of this inherited character-
istic.
	Effective as this disregard of conse-
quences may often have proved, it was
one of the elements which contributed
to the decadence of Spain; for when di-</PB>

rected, as it often was, without foresight
or judgment, it wrought havoc with in-
terests of greater moment than those it
served. The expulsions of the Jews and
of the Moriscos are conspicuous instances
of this, and, in a minor degree, the indus-
tries and commerce of the nation were
perpetually wrecked by regulations, ab-
surdly exaggerated, to serve some pur-
pose that chanced at the moment to be
uppermost in the minds of the rulers.
When, to remedy the scarcity of the
precious metals, repeated edicts, from
1623 to 1642, prohibited all manufac-
tures of gold and silver, even to embroid-
eries and gilding or plating, a flourish-
ing branch of trade was destroyed for a
time; and another was prostrated in
1683, when, to procure copper for the
debased coinage of the mints, all of that
metal in the hands of coppersmiths was
practically sequestrated, and they were
forbidden even to repair old utensils. In-
ternal industry and external commerce
were thus at the mercy of an infinity
of fluctuating regulations which embar-
rassed transactions, and deprived manu-
facturers and merchants of all sense of
security and all ability to forecast the
future. During the period when the
commerce of the world was developing
into vast proportions, that commerce, with
its resultant wealth and the power of
offense and defense derived from wealth,
fell into the hands of Spains especial
enemies, England and Holland. The
Spaniard, who despised industry and
commerce, thrust from him the inherit-
ance of Venice and Florence, which the
discovery of the New World and the
Cape route to India had offered to him:
and while his rivals waxed mightily, he
grew poorer and poorer, in spite of the
wealth of the Indies poured into his lap.
	Labor, in fact, to Spanish pride, was
the badge of inferiority, to be escaped in
every possible way. It is the general
complaint of the publicists of the seven-
teenth century that every one sought to
gain a livelihood in the public service or
in the Church, and no one to earn it by
honest work. The immense number of
useless consumers thus supported was
constantly alleged as one of the leading
causes of the general poverty, from which
the most crushing and injudicious taxa-
tion could raise only insufficient revenues.
Public offices were multiplied recklessly,
and the steady increase in the ranks of
the clergy, regular and secular, was a
constant subject of remonstrance. In
1626, Navarrete tells us that there were
thirty-two universities and more than
four thousand grammar schools crowded
with sons of artisans and peasants striv-
ing to fit themselves for public office or
holy orders; most of them failed in this
through inaptitude, and drifted into the
swarms of tramps and beggars who were
a standing curse to the community, while
the fields lay untilled for lack of labor,
and the industrial arts were slowly perish.
ing, so that Spain was forced to import
the finished products which she could so
easily have made for herself. This na-
tional aversion to labor, moreover, mani-
fested itself in an indolence which, ex-
cept in Catalonia, rendered the pretense
of working almost illusory. Dormer tells
us of his compatriots that they did not
work as in other lands; a few hours a
day, and this intermittently, were ex-
pected to provide for them as much as
the incessant activity of the foreigner.
To these drawbacks on productive in-
dustry is to be added the multitude of
feast - days, which Navarrete estimates
at about one third of the working-days,
rising to one half at the critical season
of the harvests,  feast-days which, ac-
cording to Archbishop Carranza, were
spent in a debauchery rendering them
especially welcome to the devil. Under
such conditions it was impossible for
Spain to withstand the competition of
the foreigner. How rapidly its industry
declined is shown by the fact that in
1644 the shipments by the fleet to the
West Indies from four cities of Castile
 Toledo, Segovia, Ampudia, and Pas</PB>

trana  amounted to $3,864,750, while
in 1684 the total value of all Spanish
goods carried by the fleet was only $800,-
000.	It is true that in 1691 Carlos II.
proposed legislation to check the over-
grown numbers of the clergy and the
immoderate absorption of lands by the
Church, but his feeble projects were aban-
doned.
	Thus the nation possessed little recu-
perative power to make good the per-
petual losses of its almost continuous
foreign wars. Already, in the apogee
of its greatness under Charles V., symp-
toms of exhaustion were not lacking.
His election to the empire, in 1520, was
an unmitigated misfortune for Spain.
Involved thenceforth in the entangle-
ments of his continental policy, the land
was drained of its blood and treasure for
quarrels in which it had no concern, and
of which it bore the brunt without shar-
ing the advantages. So heavy was the
load of indebtedness incurred that, on his
accession, Philip II. seriously counseled
with his ministers as to the advisability
of repudiation. Under the latter mon-
arch downward progress was accelerat-
ed. Imagining himself to be specially
called of Heaven to uphold the threat-
ened Catholic faith, he regarded no
sacrifices as too great when heresy was
to be repressed. For this he provoked
the Low Countries to revolt, leading
to a war of forty years, with uncounted
expenditure of men and money. For
this he incurred the crowning disaster
of the Armada, and for this he stimu-
lated and supported the wars of the
League in France. Despite the un-
rivaled resources of the monarchy his
finances were reduced to hopeless con-
fusion; he was a constant borrower on
usurious terms, and already in 1565 the
Venetian envoy reported his annual in-
terest payments at 5,050,000 ducats,
which at eight per cent represented an
indebtedness of 63,000,000 ducats,  a
sum, at that period, almost incredible.
When the reins slipped from his grasp,
in 1598, his successor was the feeble and
bigoted Philip III., and the seventeenth
century witnessed the fortunes of Spain
in the hands of a succession of court
favorites,  Lerma, Olivares, Haro, Ni-
thard, Oropesa, and their tribe,  most-
ly worthless and grossly incompetent.
Financial distress grew more and more
acute, aggravated by senseless tampering
with the currency, which drove to other
lands the precious metals of the New
World, until the whole active circulation
of the country consisted of a token cop-
per coinage, the value of which the gov-
ernment endeavored to regulate by a
succession of edicts of the niost contra-
dictory character, producing inextricable
perplexity and uncertainty, fatally crip-
pling what productive industry had sur-
vived the temper of the people and the
unwisdom of legislation.
	Clericalism contributed its full share
to this downward progress. The inten-
sity of the Spanish character, which can
do nothing by halves, lent an enormous
power for evil to the exaggerated reli-
gious ardor of the people. In the earlier
Middle Ages no other European nation
had been so tolerant as Spain in its deal-
ings with the Jew and the infidel, but, un-
der the careful stimulation of the Church,
this tolerant spirit had passed away with
the fourteenth century, and in its place
there had gradually arisen a fierce and
implacable hatred of all faiths outside of
Catholicism. This fanaticism gave to the
priesthood preponderating power, which
it utilized for its own behoof, in disre-
gard of the public welfare, and all doubt-
ful questions were apt to be decided in
favor of the faith. The royal confessor
was e~v officio a member of the Council
of State, and under a weak monarch his
influence was almost unbounded. Fray
Gaspar de Toledo, the confessor of Philip
III., boasted that when he ordered his
royal penitent to do or to leave undone
anything, under penalty of mortal sin,
he was obeyed; and the fate of a king-
dom thus virtually subjected to the ca</PB>

prices of a narrow - minded friar can
readily be divined. The royal confessor-
ship was frequently a stepping-stone to
the supreme office of inquisitor-general,
which controlled the conscience of the
nation; and as under such a r6gime the
delimitation between spiritual and tem-
poral affairs was most uncertain, the
wrangling between the religious and sec-
ular departments of the state was inces-
sant, to the serious detriment of united
and sagacious action. When, in the
minority of Carlos II., the regent mother,
Maria Anna of Austria, made her Ger-
man Jesuit confessor Nithard inquisitor-
general, it required a popular uprising
to get rid of him and relegate him to
Rome, for he was speedily becoming the
real ruler of Spain.
	This unreasoning religious ardor cul-
minated in the Inquisition, established
for the purpose of securing the supreme
good of unblemished purity and uniform-
ity of belief. Nothing was allowed to
stand in the way of this, and no sacrifice
was deemed too great for its accomplish-
ment. All officials, from the king down-
ward, were sworn to its support, and
the sinister influence which it exercised
was proportioned to the enormous power
which it wielded. The tragic spectacles
of the autos-de-f6 were abhorrent, but
they were of little more importance than
the closely related bull-fights in deter-
mining the fate of the nation, save in so
far as they stimulated the ruthless char-
acteristics of the people. The real sig-
nificance of the Inquisition lay in the
isolation to which it condemned the land,
and its benumbing influence on the intel-
lectual development of the people. It
created a fresh source of pride, which
led the Spaniard to plume himself on the
unsullied purity of his faith, and to de-
spise all other nations as given over, more
or less, to the errors of heresy. It ob-
structed his commercial relations by im-
posing absurd and costly regulations at
the ports to prevent the slightest chance
of the introduction of heretical opinions.
It organized a strict censorship to guard
against the intrusion of foreign ideas or
the evolution of innovations at home. It
paralyzed the national intelligence, and
resolutely undertook to keep the national
mind in the grooves of the sixteenth cen-
tury. While the rest of the civilized
world was bounding forward in a career
of progress, while science and the useful
arts were daily adding to the conquests
of man over the forces of nature, and
rival nations were growing in wealth and
power, the Inquisition condemned Spain
to stagnation; invention and discovery
were unknown at home, and their ad-
mission from abroad was regarded with
jealousy. Recuperative power was thus
wholly lacking to offset the destructive
effects of misgovernment, the national
conservatism was intensified, and a habit
of mind was engendered which has kept
Spain to this day a virtual survival of
the Renaissance.
	All these causes of retrogression were
rendered more effective by the autocratic
absolutism of the form of government,
which deprived the people of all initia-
tive, and subjected everything to the will
of the monarch. The old Castilian lib-
erties were lost in the uprising of the
Comunidades in 1520, and those of Va-
lencia about the same time in the kin-
dred tumults of the Germania, while
those which survived in Aragon and
Catalonia were swept away in 1707,
when the War of Succession gave Philip
V. the excuse for treating them as con-
quered provinces. Nowhere in Europe,
west of Russia, had the maxim of the
imperial jurisprudence, Quod placuit
principi legis habet vigorem, more ab-
solute sway. The legislative and execu-
tive functions were combined in the sov-
ereign; there were no national political
life, no training in citizenship, no forces
to counterbalance the follies or prejudices
of the king and his favorites. Under a
series of exceptionally able rulers, this
form of government might have main-
tained Spanish prosperity and power,</PB>

while repressing enlightenment, but it
was the peculiar curse of Spain that
the last three Hapsburg princes, whose
reigns filled the whole of the sixteenth
century, were weak, and their choice of
favorites, ghostly and secular, was un-
wise. Especially the latest one, Carlos
II., brought Spain to the nadir of de-
cadence. At his death, in 1700, the
Spanish population is estimated to have
shrunk within a century from ten to five
millions. The prolonged War of Suc-
cession which followed partook so much
of the nature of civil strife as to be pecu-
liarly exhausting to the scanty resources
left by the misgovernment of the preced-
ing two centuries, but with the accession
of the Bourbons there was a promise of
improvement. Philip V. was weak, but
he was not as bigoted and obscurantist as
his predecessors, and his sons, Ferdinand
VI. and Carlos III., were men of more
liberal ideals. Especially was Carlos an
enlightened monarch,~who curbed to some
extent the Inquisition, relaxed somewhat
the rigid censorship of the press, and
earnestly strove to promote the indus-
trial development of his kingdom. Un-
der his rule prosperity began to revive,
and there seemed a prospect that Spain
might assert her place among progressive
nations.
	The outbreak of the French Revolution,
l~wever, was the death-blow of liberal-
ism. Dynastic considerations outweighed
all others, and the rulers of Spain were
especially sensitive to the dangers appre-
hended from the introduction of theories
as to the rights of man and universal
equality. Carlos III. had died in 1788,
and his son, Carlos IV., was weak, bigot-
ed, reactionary, and wholly under the
influence of his favorite, Godoy, the so-
called Prince of Peace. His son and
successor, Ferdinand VII., was trained
in the same school. After the Napole-
onic invasion and the Peninsular War,
his restoration, in 1814, was the signal
for the sternest repressive and reaction-
ary measures; tbe monarch claimed ab
solute power, the Constitution of 1812
was set aside, censorship was revived in
the most despotic fashion, the Inquisi-
tion was re&#38; ~stablished, and nothing was
left undone to bring back the conditions
of the sixteenth century. These con-
ditions were upset by the revolution of
1820, but restored by the intervention of
the Holy Alliance in 1823, when the Due
dAngoul~me, at the head of a French
army, executed the mandate of the Con-
gress of Verona. The history of Spain
since then, with its succession of civil wars,
revolutions, and experiments in govern-
ment, holds out little promise of settled
and orderly progress. The national char-
acteristic of indomitable pride which dis-
dains to learn from tho experience of
other nations, the tendency to resort to
violent and exaggerated methods, the
dense political ignorance of the masses,
so sedulously deprived through long gen-
erations of all means of political enlighten-
ment and all training in political action,
combine to render the nation incapable
of conducting wisely the liberal institu-
tions which are foreign importations, and
not the outgrowth of native aspirations
and experience. In many respects the
Spaniard is still living in the sixteenth
century, unable to assimilate the ideas of
the nineteenth, or to realize that bis coun-
try is no longer the mistress of the sea
and the dominating power of the land.
	There is still another cause which has
contributed largely to Spanish decadence.
All governments are more or less cor-
rupt,  absolute honesty would appear
to be impossible in the conduct of pub-
lic affairs,  but the corruption and ve-
nality of Spanish administration have
been peculiarly all-pervading and con-
tinuous. From the time of the youthful
Charles V. and his worthless horde of
Flemish favorites, this has been a corrod-
ing cancer, sapping the vitality of Span-
ish resources. It was in vain that the
most onerous and disabling imposts were
laid on wealth and industry; the results
were always insufficient, and the national</PB>

finances were always in disorder, crip-
pling all efforts at aggression or defense.
Already in 1551 the cortes of Castile
gave a deplorable account of the corrup-
tion in every branch of official life, the
destruction of industry, and the misery of
the people under their crushing burdens.
In 1656, when Philip IV., under a com-
plication of misfortunes, was struggling
to avert bankruptcy, Cardinal Moscoso,
the Archbishop of Toledo, bluntly told
him that not more than ten per cent of
the revenues collected reached the royal
treasury. While income was thus fatal-
ly diminished, expenditure was similarly
augmented through collusion, fraud, and
bribery. It raises a curious psychological
question, how pride and punctilious sen-
sitiveness as to honor can coexist with
eager rapacity f6r iniquitous gains, how
undoubted patriotism can accommod~te
itself to a system which deprives the fa-
therland of the resources necessary to its
existence; but human nature is often only
consistent in inconsistency. To what
extent this prevails at the present day
must of course be only a matter of con-
jecture, but recent events would seem to
indicate that supplies and munitions paid
for are not on hand when urgently need-
ed, and that troops in the field bear but
a slender proportion to those on the pay-
roll. When, the other day, Don Carlos
alluded to generously voted millions
diverted from the fulfillment of their
patriotic purpose to the pockets of fraud-
ulent contractors and dishonest state
employees, and disorder, peculation, and
mendacity in every department of the
public service, he merely described con-
ditions which in Spain have been chronic
for centuries.

	If the above is a truthful outline of
the causes of Spanish decadence, it can
arouse no wonder that Spanish colonial
policy has been a failure. All the de-
fects of character and administration
which produced such disastrous results
at home had naturally fuller scope for
development in the colonies. The dis-
coveries of Columbus did not open up a
new continent to be settled by industri-
ous immigrants coming to found states
and develop their resources in peaceful
industry. The marvelous exploits of
the Conquistadores were performed in
the craziest thirst for gold, and those
who succeeded them came in the hope
of speedy enrichment and return, to ac-
complish which they exploited to the
utmost the unhappy natives, and when
these were no longer available replaced
them with African slaves. The mother
country similarly looked upon her new
possessions simply as a source of revenue,
to be drained to the utmost, either for
herself or for the benefit of those whom
she sent out to govern them. Colonists
who finally settled and cast their lot in
the INew World ~vere consequently ex-
posed to every limitation and discrimi-
nation that perverse ingenuity could sug-
gest, and were sacrificed to the advan-
tage, real or imaginary, of Spain. The
short-sighted financial and commercial
policy at home would in itself have suf-
ficed to condemn the colonies to stag-
nation and misery, but in addition they
were subjected to special restrictions
and burdens. It was not until 1788
that trade with them was permitted
through any port but Cadiz, whose mer-
chants made use of their monopoly to
exact a profit of from one hundred to
two hundred per cent. Export and
import duties were multiplied, till the
producer was deprived of all incentive
to exertion, and the populations were
taxed to their utmost capacity, the taxes
being exacted with merciless severity.
	As if this were not enough, the all-
pervading influence of clericalism ren-
dered good government well-nigh im-
possible. Under its influence the colo-
nial organizations consisted of sundry
independent jurisdictions, incompatible
with the preservation of order in any
community, and especially unfitted for
the administration of a colony, sepa</PB>

rated by a thousand leagues from the
supreme authority which alone could
compose their differences. There was
the royal representative, the viceroy or
governor, responsible for the defense of
the province and the maintenance of
order. There was the church establish-
ment with its bishop or archbishop, in
no way subordinate to the civil power.
There were the various regular orders,
 Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustin-
ians, Jesuits, etc.,  bitterly jealous of
one another and prompt to quarrel, ex-
empt from episcopal jurisdiction, and
subject only to their respective superiors
or to the Pope, except when suspicion of
heresy might render individual members
answerable to the Inquisition. Finally,
there was the Inquisition itself, which
owned obedience only to the Supreme
Council of the Holy Office in Madrid,
and held itself superior to all other ju-
risdictions; for under its delegated papal
power it could at will paralyze the au-
thority of any one, from the highest to
the lowest, by its excommunication,
while no priest or prelate could excom-
municate its ministers. It was impossi-
ble that so irrational a scheme of social
order should work smoothly. Causes
of dissension, trivial or serious, between
these rival and jealous jurisdictions were
rarely lacking, and the internal history
of the colonies consists in great part of
their quarrels, which disturbed the peace
of the communities and hindered pro-
sperity and growth.
	In The Atlantic Monthly for August,
1891, I described at some length a com-
plicated quarrel between the Franciscans
and the Bishop of Cartagena de las In-
dias, in which both the Inquisition and
the royal governor intervened, keeping
the community in an uproar from 1683
to 1688. This was followed, in 1693,
by an outbreak between the governor,
Ceballos, and the Inquisition. In the
public meat-market a butcher refused to
give precedence to a negro slave of the
inquisitor, who thereupon had the indis
creet butcher arrested and confined in
chains in the eareeles seeretas of the
Inquisition. This in itself was a most
serious punishment, for such imprison-
ment left an ineffaceable stigma on the
sufferer and on his descendants for two
generations. The governor pleaded in
vain with the inquisitor, and then en-
deavored secretly to obtain testimony
to send to Madrid, but without success,
for no one dared to give evidence. The
fact of his attempt leaked out, however,
and the secretary of the Inquisition led
a mob to the palace, and forced the gov-
ernor, under threat of excommunication,
to sign a declaration that he abandoned
the case to the Inquisition, that all re-
ference to it should be expunged from
the records of .the municipality and all
papers relating to it should be delivered
to the inquisitor. He submitted, and his
only recourse was to write a piteous let-
ter to the Council of the Indies. Such
appeal to the home authorities was of
uncertain outcome, for the inquisitors
were by no means ready to submit to
an adverse decision. In a complicated
quarrel between the cruzada, the epis-
copal court, the Inquisition, and the
viceroy of Peru, in 1729, the inquisi-
tors of Lima formally and repeatedly
refused obedience to a royal order sent
through the viceroy, alleging that they
were subject only to the Supreme Coun-
cil of the Holy Office. In 1751 they
took the same ground in a case in which
the king decided against them, and they
held out until 1760, when a more per-
emptory command was received, accom-
panied by a dispatch from the council
which they could not disregard.
	Thus, to a greater or less degree, all
Spanish colonies were fields in which
clericalism rioted at will. Paraguay,
where the Jesuits succeeded in building
up an independent theocracy, offers the
most perfect illustration of the result,
and a somewhat less conspicuous instance
is found in the Philippines. There the
missions of the Augustinian Recollects</PB>

acquired such power that the annals of
that colony seem rather to be the re-
cords of the Augustinian province of
San Nicoliis than those of a royal de-
pendency. This Augustinian supremacy
was unsuccessfully disputed by the Do-
minicans, in the early years of the eigh-
teenth century, but the Jesuits proved
to be more dangerous rivals, who did
not scruple, in 1736, to induce their na-
tive subjects to make war on those of
the Augustinians. The banishment in
1767 of the Society of Jesus from the
Spanish dominions left the field to the
Augustinians, who have since held it,
apparently without making effort to se-
cure the good will of their flocks. They
had their own internal troubles, however,
for in 1712 the hostility between the
Aragonese and Castilians led to a schism
which had to be referred to Spain
for settlement, when the Castilians, who
were the losing party, refused to submit
until the acting governor, Torralba, em-
ployed the persuasive influence of artil-
lery. The character of their relations
with the secular authority can be estiinat-
ed from an occurrence in 1643, when
the governor, Sebastian Hurtado de
Corcuera, in preparing to resist an ex-
pected attack by the Dutch, undertook
to fortify Manila. An Augustinian con-
vent and church occupied a site re-
quired for a demilune. Corcuera offered
the friars another church and 4000
pesos; but they refused to niove, and
obstinately remained in the convent un-
til the progress of the works rendered
it uninhabitable, when it was torn down
and the materials were used in the
lines. They raised a great clamor, which
probably was the cause of the removal
of Corcuera in 1644, when they pro-
secuted their grievance in court, and
obtained a decree reinstating them and
casting him in damages to the amount
of 25,000 pesos. They tore down the
fortifications, rebuilt the church, and
threw Corcuera into prison, where he
languished under cruel treatment for five
years. He had been an excellent ad-
ministrator, and on his liberation Philip
IV. appointed him governor of the Ca-
naries.
	In such a community the position of
governor had few attractions for an hon-
est man. In 1719, a new one, Busta-
mente Bustihlo, found on his arrival
that all the royal officials had been busi-
ly embezzling and pilfering, leaving the
treasury nearly empty. After ascertain-
ing the facts he set to work energetically
to recover the funds and to punish the
guilty, who thereupon, as seems to have
been customary in such cases, sought
asylum in the churches, One of them
had carried with him certain official re-
cords necessary for the verification of
the accounts, and these Bustillo requested
the archbishop to make him surrender.
The archbishop replied with a learned
argument, drawn up for him by a Jesuit,
proving that the governors request was
illegal. Bustillo lost his temper at this,
and arrested the archbishop, who forth-
with cast an interdict over the city.
Then the monks and friars turned .out
in organized bands, marching through
the streets with crucifixes, and shouting,
Viva la f6! Viva ha Iglesia! They
speedily collected a mob which they led
to the palace; the doors were broken in,
the governor and his son murdered, and
when the archbishop was released he as-
sumed the governorship, under the ad-
vice of an assembly consisting exclusive-
ly of ecclesiastical dignitaries.
	In these perpetually recurring troubles
between the secular and the clerical au-
thorities the Inquisition was not behind-
hand, although there was no organized tri-
bunal in Manila. The Philippines were
an appendage to the viceroyalty of New
Spain or Mexico, and the Holy Office of
Mexico merely delegated a commissioner
at Manila to execute its orders and make
reports to it. Subordinate as was this
position, those who held it deemed them-
selves superior to the royal authorities.
About 1650 the padre commissioner re</PB>

ceived an order to arrest and send to
Acapulco a person who was governor
of one of the islands and commandant
of a fortified town. The commissioner
was also an officer of the government,
and knew the risk he ran of offending
the governor of the colony in not ad-
vising him of what was impending; but
the obligation of secrecy in inquisitorial
matters was superior to all other con-
siderations. He quietly summoned his
alcaide mayor and a sufficient number
of familiars, sailed for the island, sur-
prised the governor in his bed, carried
him off, and imprisoned him in a con-
vent until there should be an opportu-
nity of shipping him to Mexico. The
governor of the colony was Don Diego
Faxardo, a violent and irascible soldier,
whose term of service was a perpetual
embroilment with the unruly jurisdic-
tions under his charge, and who knew
the danger of leaving a fortified post
without a commander when there was
almost constant war, either with the
Dutch or with the natives. A rude explo-
sion of wrath was to be expected at this
contemptuous disregard of the respect
due to his office and of the safety of the
land, yet Don Diego so thoroughly re-
cognized the supremacy of the Inquisi-
tion that when apprised of the affair lie
only chided the padre gently for not hav-
ing given him a chance of winning the
graces and indulgences promised for so
pious a work, seeing that he would have
regarded as the utmost good fortune the
opportunity of serving as an alguazil in
making the arrest.
	Twenty years later, the Augustinian
Fray Joseph de Paternina Samaniego,
then commissioner of the Inquisition,
was even bolder. He was ordered from
Mexico to take secret testimony against
the governor of the colony, Don Diego
de Salcedo, and forward it to Mexico
for examination by the tribunal there.
This was all that a commissioner was
empowered to do, and he was especially
instructed to go no further; but the Au-
gustinians had had quarrels with the gov-
ernor, and the whole affair was probably
a plot for his removal. Fray Paternina
therefore proceeded to act on the testi-
moimy, although the judge, Don Fran-
cisco de Montemayor, warned him of his
lack of authority, and that such a per-
sonage as the governor could not be ar-
rested without a special c~dula from the
king, passed upon by the Council of the
Inquisition. He drew up a warrant of
arrest, went at midnight to the palace
with some friars and familiars, seized
Salcedo in his bed, handcuffed him, and
carried him off to the Augustinian con-
vent, where the bells were rung in honor
of the event. He then gave notice to
the royal court that the governorship was
vacant, and might be filled, which was
done by the appointment of his ally, Don
Juan Manuel de ha Pe?ia. He further
issued an edict forbidding any one, under
pain of excommunication, to speak about
the arrest or about his other proceedings;
and to inspire fear he brought charges
against various persons, under pretext
that they were inimical to the Holy Office.
Salcedos property was sequestrated, to
the profit of those concerned in the affair,
and he was shipped by the first vessel
to Acapulco, but he died on the voyage.
When the news of this outrage reached
Madrid by way of Flanders, the Conneil
of the Indies complained bitterly, and
asked that steps he taken to prevent a
repetition of acts so dangerous to the
safety of the colonies. The, Council of
the Inquisition calmly replied that no
new instructions were needed, for there
were ample provisions for filling a sud-
den vacancy; as for Fray Paternina, if
he bad gone too far he would be duly
corrected. The Council of the Indies
insisted, and was supported by the queen
regent. Meanwhile, the Council of the
Inquisition had examined the testimony
taken against Salcedo, pronounced it friv-
olous, declared his arrest void, and or-
dered his property to be restored to his
heirs, while Fray Paternina was to be</PB>

sent to Spain for trial. On the journey
he died at Acapulco, and the matter was
dropped.
	Successful colonization under such a
system was a manifest impossibility, and
it is no wonder that the Spanish depend-
encies languished, in spite of their infi-
nite potentialities of wealth and pro-
sperity. The narrow and selfish policy
of the mother country deprived the colo-
nists of all incentives to exertion; the
officials sent from Spain enriched them-
selves, the tax-gatherers seized all su-
perfluous earnings; there were no accu-
mulation of capital and no advancement.
In 1736, the viceroy of the vast kingdom
of Peru, Don Jos6 Armendaris, Marquis
of Castel - Fuerte, in the report which,
according to custom, he drew up for the
instruction of his successor, described the
condition of the colony as deplorable.
The Spanish population was mostly con-
centrated in Lima; the nobles and the
wealthy oppressed the poor; the cor-
regidores and priests oppressed the In-
dians; the priests paid little attention
to their religious duties, for they were
not compelled to residence by their bish-
ops, and were abandoned to sloth and
licentiousness; the judges were venal;
and the population was diminishing.
The religious orders, he said, ought to be
checked, an(l not encouraged, for in Lima
there were thirty-four convents, each of
them, on an average, equal to four in
Spain, which was the most ecclesiastical
of all lands. This monastic hypertrophy
he attributed to the fact that the men
had no other career open to them, and
the women consequently could not find
husbands. This gloomy utterance was
re~choed, twenty years later, by a subse-
quent viceroy, Don Jos6 Antonio Manto
de Velasco.
	Still more desponding is a report
made in 1772 by Francisco Antonio
Moreno y Escandon as to the condition
of the New Kingdom of Granada,
embracing the northern coast from Pa-
nama to Venezuela, a region abounding
in natural wealth. The local officials
everywhere, he says, were indifferent
and careless as to their duty; the people
were steeped in poverty; trade was al-
most extinct; capital was lacking, and
there were no opportunities for its in-
vestment; the only source of support
was the cultivation of small patches of
ground. Every one sought to subsist on
the government by procuring some little
office. The mining of the precious metals
was the sole source of trade, of procuring
necessities from abroad, and of meeting
the expenses of the government; but al-
though the mines were as rich as ever,
their product had greatly decreased.
Commerce with Spain employed only one
or two ships, with registered cargoes, a
year from Cadiz to Cartagena, whence
the goods were distributed through the
interior, but so burdened with duties and
expenses that no profit could be made
on them. If freedom of export could be
had for the rich productions of the couw
try,  cocoa, tobacco, precious woods,
etc.,  the colony would flourish; but
there were no manufactures, and no
money could be kept in the land. The
missions had made no progress for a
hundred years in christianizing the In-
dians, for the missionaries undertook the
duty only for the purpose of securing a
life of ease and sloth.
	Such was the result of three hundred
years of colonization under Spanish
methods; and we can scarce wonder that,
after such a training, the nations which
emancipated themselves have found self-
government so difficult. Under the
warning given by their loss, some im-
provement has been made in the insular
possessions which were unable to throw
off the yoke, but not enough to prevent
chronic disaffection and constantly re-
curring efforts at revolt. Spain has
made of her colonies the buried talent,
and the fulfillment of the parable must
come to pass.

WAR AND MONEY: SOME LESSONS OF 1862.

	THE soundness of an institution is put
to a test by the strain of a critical mo-
ment. Even in times of peace our mon-
etary system has created grave alarm;
what then must be in store for us in the
emergencies of war?
	In all the energetic and hopeful move-
ment of recent years for the reform of
our monetary evils, we have been hold-
ing up to view the necessity for legisla-
tive action in anticipation of a possible
day of reckoning; and that day of reck-
oning has unexpectedly come upon us in
the war with Spain. It now makes lit-
tle difference whether the war be long
or short, so far as concerns the existing
fact of an actual currency crisis ; the
crisis is upon us, and our system will
soon be put on trial. The preliminary
appropriation of $50,000,000 out of the
Treasury balance for war expenditures
was itself a step toward monetary com-
plications, and as a hint of congressional
methods is big with possibilities.
	It is a matter of common knowledge
that we have long been living in feverish
uncertainty under a monetary system in
which the standard for prices and for
all complicated business transactions has
been subject to doubt. No sooner had we
made the paper promises of the govern-
ment (which had been our standard from
1862 to 1879) as good as gold (January

or in the disturbances produced by fiscal
needs. Among the greatest disasters of
war should be counted the shaking of the
weak foundations on which our standard
rests, and the toppling over of the edi-
fice of our national credit.
	That the continuance of the gold
standard depends upon the ability of the

sary to emphasize. The business world
has beeii again and again alarmed by

cannot be laid: the 01(1 easy-going and

tween the fiscal and the monetary func-
tions of the Treasury, which in 1861</PB>

wrecked the credit of the United States,
and led to the financial d~b69cle of 1864
when Mr. Chase resigned his portfolio
in despair. Out of this confusion of
mind may easily result a policy which
may entail upon us evil consequences for
decades to come. It will be the purpose
to hide dubious schemes under the guise
of patriotism. By representing as un-
patriotic everything which does not tally
with selfish and partisan designs, an at-
tempt is made to deny a hearing to the
teachings of experience, of reason, of
sound monetary judgment, and hence of
all that most concerns the honor of our
country,  of all that is, in the true
sense, most patriotic. If this spirit is to
control our new fiscal legislation, there
is grave trouble ahead of us.
	It is perfectly clear, however, that the
present war can be conducted without se-
lions commercial distress other than that
entailed by a diversion of industry and
by increased taxation. The incidents of
the day, if availed of, must be regarded
as extremely favorable. The generally
prosperous condition of all our indus-
tries, the quickening results of the last
great harvcst, which was accompanied
by a strong European demand and high
prices for our cereals, the unparalleled
balance of $470,000,000 of exports over
imports in nine months, the consequent
credits due us from abroad, and the ex-
ceptional flow of gold rising beyond $60,-
000,000 to our side as soon as our credits
are drawn upon,  these are fortunate
conditions, for which, in this juncture,
we ought to be profoundly grateful; all
the more grateful because they furnish
a basis upon which our fiscal affairs may
be conducted with signal success, if we
but avoid the fatal confusion between
fiscal and monetary operations from
which we have suffered so grievously in
the past; if we but hold to the elemen-
tary principle that the Treasury requires
in time of war a control of wealth and
capital,  of goods, and not merely of
the medium of exchange which performs
the subsidiary work of transferring these
goods. It is not difficult to understand
that, in times either of peace or of war,
the one important matter is the pro-
duction and possession of the articles
needed by the country. Money serves
only a subsidiary purpose as a medium
by which these articles (expressed in
terms of money) are exchanged; and a
small amount of money goes on doing
the vast work of exchange in an unceas-
ing round. In days of peace, when pro-
duction is normal, every one knows how
desirable it is to have no disturbances in
trade arising from defects in the mone-
tary machinery. In days of war, pro-
duction is even more essential than in a
period of peace; the main economic dif-
ference (apart from the withdrawal of
laborers) at the time being the partial
readjustment of productive effort to arti-
cles for the army and navy. Hence how
much more necessary it is, in the ab-
normal conditions of war, to be free from
additional disturbances caused to indus-
try by tampering with the standard, and
thus breaking up the efficiency of the
system by which exchanges are carried
on! Changes in the standard would do
more than merely affect the convenience
of industry; by modifying the measure
in which prices are expressed, they would
bring in endless confusion, increase the
national debt, lower the purchasing pow-
er of wages, and weaken the vital re-
sources of the land.
	In view of all our residuary legacies
from the issue of inconvertible paper
during the civil war, it should be super-
fluous to suggest that a war emergency
does not necessarily require a resort to
paper money or a departure from the
existing standard. Unfortunately, in the
minds of men, high and low, there ex-
ists an insistent belief that somehow or
other paper money is an essential con-
comitant of war. Perhaps it arises from
the remembrance that such has been the
fact in most cases of war known to their
experience; which may be only another</PB>

way of admitting that inefficient finan-
cial management has been the rule. At
any rate, the idea which should hold pos-
session of the national consciousness, in
this affair with Spain, is that abundant
means for war expenses can be provided
without giving up our standard, but above
all tbat these funds can be most easily
and cheaply obtained by merely avoiding
any action which can in the slightest de-
gree be construed as disturbing the ex-
isting standard. The suggestion of in-
creased paper issues, a menace to the
existing gold reserves by appropriating
Treasury balances, any proposition to use
more silver, in fact any increase of our
demand obligations, would create doubt
as to the standard, and for that reason
should be regarded as unpatriotic in the
truest sense.
	Instead of carrying us through the
civil war, the government paper money
was the one conspicuous enemy of pub-
lic credit, of the soldier, and of the la-
borer at home. If we came through the
crisis, it was solely because we withstood
not only the heavy blows of war itself,
but also the injuries arising from an in-
iquitous monetary system. In the sum-
mer of 1861, after the bankers of New
York, Boston, and Philadelphia, with
many doubts, had patriotically assumed
the task of selling bonds for the United
States to the amount of $150,000,000,
they found the community unwilling to
buy them in the existing condition of
government credit at the rate of interest
exacted. Being under agreement to pay
the Treasury for these obligations in gold,
when they found their means locked up
in unsalable securities they were finally
obliged to suspend specie payments (on
December 30, 1861). With the best of
intentions, but in dense ignorance of in-
vestment requirements, Congress, by a
strange fatuity, forbade the sale of bonds
below par. Given a fixed rate of inter-
est, the selling price of a bond is high or
low according to the high or low credit
of the issuer. Our credit in 1861 being
	VOL. LXXXIT.  NO. 489.	4
far from good, Congress made it impos-
sible to sell bonds at a price which in-
vestors would pay for the fixed return,
thus voluntarily cutting itself off from
usual and legitiniate methods of bor-
rowing, and making little or no resort
to emergency taxation. The Treasury
found itself in an impasse; whereupon
it was claimed that the issue of incon-
vertible paper money was a necessity.
Curiously blind to the fact that the price
of bonds is a market judgment as to
the credit of the issuer, we refused to
accept the consequences of a low credit,
and a measure was proposed pret~minent-
ly adapted to destroy any little credit
that remained. Without trying to bor-
row in the way which the strongest mod-
ern nations find legitimate, desperately
in need of funds, the Treasury came to
the last resort of a bankrupt government,
and issued inconvertible paper money.
To put out paper promises to pay on
demand, when all the world knew there
was not a dollar of coin in reserve to
redeem the paper, was a pitifully open
way of advertising the hopeless condition
of the Treasury. No lover of our coun-
try can look back on that spectacle with-
out chagrin and wounded national pride.
If the enemies of the United States had
cunningly planned to corner the Trea-
sury, they could not have gained their
purpose more effectually than was ac-
complished by the blunders of ardent
friends. A great and prosperous coun-
try, and yet unable to borrow! For the
words of Charles Sumner were admit-
tedly true then, as they are to-day: 
Our country is rich and powerful,
with a numerous population, busy, hon-
est, and determined, and with unparal-
leled resources of all kinds, agricultural,
mineral, industrial, commercial; it is yet
undrained by the war in which we are
engaged; nor has the enemy succeeded
in depriving us of any of the means of
livelihood. It is hard  very hard 
to think that such a country, so power-
ful, so rich, and so beloved, should be</PB>

compelled to adopt a policy of even
questionable propriety.
	The disasters of the civil war will
not have been in vain if they bite into
our consciousness the lines of distinction
between measures fit for fiscal needs 
the provision of funds by taxation and
borrowing  and those which have a
wholly separate function in maintaining
unshaken a standard for prices and con-
tracts. The former should be kept en-
tirely apart from the latter. Instead of
trying to supply emergency needs in a
way to complicate the monetary system,
or to introduce a fluctuating paper for a
gold standard, common prudence should
have dictated a scrupulous avoidance of
all measures of borrowing which in any
way touched the standard. The action
of our leaders in 1862 seems still stran-
ger, when we find that these alternatives
had been clearly laid before them by a
deputation from New York, Boston, and
Philadelphia, headed by Mr. George S.
Coe and Mr. James Gallatin. In a con-
ference with Secretary Chase explicit di-
rections were given how the government
might borrow unlimited sums without
a resort to inconvertible paper, as fol-
lows 
(1.) A tax bill to raise, in the dif-
ferent modes of taxatjon, $125,000,000
over and above duties on imports.
	(2.) No issue of demand Treasury
notes except those authorized at the ex-
tra session in July last.
	(3.) An issue of $100,000,000 Trea-
sury notes at two years, in sums of five
doijars and upwards, to be receivable for
public dues to the government, except du-
ties on imports.
	(4.) A suspension of the Sub-Treasury
Act, so as to allow the banks to become
depositories of the government of all
loans, and so that the Treasury will
check on the banks from time to time
as the government may want money.
	(5.) An issue of six per cent twenty-
year bonds, to be negotiated by the Sec-
retary of the Treasary,~and without any
limitation as to the price he may obtain
for them in the market.
	(6.) The Secretary of the Treasury
should be empowered to make tempora-
ry loans to the extent of any portion of
the funded stock authorized by Congress,
with power to hypothecate such stock;
and, if such loans are not paid at matu-
rity, to sell the stock hypothecated for
the best price that can be obtained.
	Not all these details, of course, are
applicable to our existing situation, hut
the pith of this advice lies in the ap-
plication of ordinary business methods
to the operations of the Treasury, and
in the avoidance of dangerous demand
obligations for whose redemption no
reserves have been provided. In spite
of these suggestions, Congress in 1862
issued irredeemable paper money which
subsequently depreciated to thirty-five
cents on the dollar; and as this money
was received at par for bonds, the obli-
gations of the nation were in reality
sold at less than par in gold. That is,
Congress did not in fact escape the
necessity of selling our bonds for what
they would bring, but, by attempting to
evade fundamental principles, it accom-
plished nothing for its purpose, while
bringing wreck and ruin to the credit
of the Treasury. Everything which the
advocates of paper money said would
not happen did happen, and in a way
most dispiriting to all courageous sup-
porters of the Union.
	The danger of the hour arises from
a defective because uncertain monetary
system, due to the presence of the paper
money which once did such damage,
and to the evident force which the sil-
ver party still displays at Washington.
The fear is that, in the bustle of war,
attention will be directed to other things
than monetary reform; and when fiscal
legislation comes into the hands of en-
emies to our existing standard, the need
of borrowing will be made an excuse for
changes in fiscal measures which may
prevent a proper regulation of the cur-</PB>

rency. The cunning schemer will pro-
vide the policy, while crass minds will
be drawn in as tools; both must unite
to work the damage. But the point is
not bard to make clear, so that intriguers
should find it difficult to deceive.
	If our government borrows by cre-
ating a demand debt in a form to be
used as currency, it mixes the borrow-
ing, or fiscal, measure with the regula-
tion of our monetary system, exactly
when the latter should most be kept
inviolate. The inherent danger of this
is not far to seek. By building up a vast
superstructure of demand paper and a
silver currency of a value far less than
its face, all depending upon a slender
gold reserve for the redemption which
gives it parity, an instant connection is
established between every event which
may affect the income or credit of the
Treasury and the machinery of prices
and contracts with which trade is carried
on.	The one important aim of Treasury
management should be to keep these
two matters entirely distinct. There is
no reason whatever why fiscal measures
for borrowing should in the slightest
way be complicated with the machinery
which the community has evolved as a
standard and for the exchange of goods.
It is the duty of the state to keep its
hands off this machinery, to recognize
the facts of civilized commercial experi-
ence, and to go on its way borrowing
and taxing, without thought of interfer-
ing with that which is at the very base
of business life. If, as now, it is not
easy to maintain our standard in gold,
it would be a wanton attack on indus-
trial enterprise to make more complicat-
ed a situation already difficult.
	By making a demand debt of the
government serve as money, an intoler-
able situation is created whenever an
emergency like the present conflict with
Spain arises. This money, the value of
which is dependent on the fiscal condi-
tion of the Treasury, is the agent by
which the world of business is exchan
ging goods, and upon whose value all
prices and contracts depend. Conse-
quently, every passing event of war or
politics, every victory or defeat of our
army or navy, every party success or
failure, through its effect on the credit
of the Treasury, passes directly  like
electricity on a live wire  to the value
of the paper and all fiduciary currency,
and then moves swiftly on, after produ-
cing fluctuations in the standard, to all
the transactions of trade and industry.
It should never be that ups and downs
of Treasury finance should have any con-
nection whatever with the standard and
the conduct of business. The moment
our government does anything to create
uncertainty in the existing standard, that
moment this uncertainty changes normal
business into a matter of guesswork and
speculation. This is but a r6sum6 of
our experience in the civil war.
	The present situation is in some re-
spects more favorable, and in some less
favorable, than that of 1861. We are
fortunate in having at the head of the
Treasury an experienced financier, while
in 1861 we blundered because there
was no leader with an intelligent know-
ledge of what should be done. The
abundant harvest of last year and our
unparalleled exports, as has been said,
are causes for congratulation. But, on
the other hand, the precedents of wrong-
doing are present with us in the form
of the United States notes and the mass
of silver currency, and the monetary
system is in unstable equilibrium. As
every one knows, our national bank-
notes are redeemable in lawful money;
hence their value depends upon the kind
of money in which they are redeemed.
Our legal tender notes (United States
notes and Treasury notes of 1890) de-
pend for their value on the sufficiency
of the gold reserve in the Treasury.
Moreover, the receipt of silver currency
on equal terms with gold in payments
to the Treasury, and the outgoing pay-
ment by the Treasury of all demand</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00058" SEQ="0058" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="52">52	War and iJifoney: Some Lessons of 18G2.

upon it in gold, maintain the parity of
$455,000,000 of silver with gold. If
the reserves behind the paper are in any
way exhausted, then the Treasury can-
not pay gold on demand, and the silver
will no longer be kept at a value greater
than its own. Clearly, our existing stan-
dard pivots on the gold reserve of the
Treasury.
It may not he amiss to quote here the
deliberate judgment of the monetary
commission at a time when there was
little thought of war with Spain 
The existence of a large outstanding
debt payable on demand is also a source
of weakness to the government in its in-
ternational relations. Modern warfare
is so expensive that it is almost as much
a matter of money as of men. A nation
suddenly confronted by the alternative
of war or dishonor would be greatly
handicapped by a large demand debt
which it must provide for at once. Great
additional force is given to this con-
sideration by the fact that it would be
scarcely possible for this nation to en-
gage in war in its present situation 
counting as part of the situation the im-
perfect development of clear conceptions
on the subject of money in the minds
of the people  without a suspension of
specie payments and a resort to further
issues of government notes. There is no
occasion to criticise those patriotic men
who believed that the issue of green-
backs was necessary to save the Union.
But the world has advanced in financial
knowledge and skill since then. There
is no doubt that if our government were
relieved of its existing demand obliga-
tions, and our currency system put in
working order upon a gold basis, it would
be entirely possible for us to go through
a war without suspension of specie pay-
ment or any derangement of our mone-
tary system. If war should come, the
value to the country of the ability to thus
avoid the indirect losses following from
depreciated currency, inflated prices, and
financial demoralization would be so
great that the burden of paying off now
our demand obligations would be as no-
thing in comparison.
	The peculiarity, however, of our pre-
sent situation resides in the fact that a
departure from our standard may not
necessarily result from additional issues
of paper money as in 1862, but from
an interference with the gold reserve
in the Treasury which would quickly
bring us to the silver standard. Whe-
ther the deflection from the existing or-
der is produced by resort to paper or to
silver, the primary effects would be much
the same. To be sure, the President
may still in emergencies sell bonds, under
the Resumption Act, to provide gold for
this reserve. There is thus no possible
reason why this gold reserve, under effi-
cient management, should be allowed to
ooze away and bring us to a change of
standard. There is potential difficulty,
however, in the mental attitude of Con-
gress. It has plunged us into war; it
has made the expenditure of vast sums
a necessary consequence. Then, what
will be the disposition of Congress as to
means for providing these funds?
	From this point of view, the appro-
priation of $50,000,000 and the attitude
of the Senate are big with suggestions.
The Treasury balance which had been
accumulated by the sale of bonds during
the last administration, to secure gold for
the protection of the standard, was at
once, and without debate, voted away
to a very considerable extent. It is
no answer if it be said that a dramatic
effect was intended by giving instant
purchasing power to the President, since
that result could have been equally well
accomplished by giving the Secretary
authority to sell bonds at a proper rate
of interest, and by insuring the payment
of the principal in gold instead of in du-
bious coin. Therefore, this first ac-
tion has in it a world of suggestiveness
as to the likelihood that Congress will
obtain the funds for war by means which
will leave our standard intact.</PB>

	How dangerous this appropriation was
does not seem to be generally realized.
As a matter of fact there were not funds
enough in the Treasury to warrant an
appropriation of $50,000,000. The gen-
eral Treasury balance at the time was
about $225,000,000. From this must
be deducted the following items: 
Fractional and minor coins largely
	uncurrent	$13,000,000
Receipts from sale of Union Pacific
railway, held to pay bonds Jan
 uary 1, 1899	14,000,000
Funds held for redemption of na-
 tional bank - notes to be with-
 drawn	33,000,000
Reserved in Treasury for ordinary
 working balance	40,000,000

$100,000,000

	These items, together with the $100,-
000,000 held as gold reserve for Unit-
ed States notes, leave a balance of only
$25,000,000 subject to appropriation.
That is, if $50,000,000 were taken out
of the Treasury very soon, it would
either trench upon a small working bal-
ance for daily needs, or at once cut into
the gold reserve now supporting our
whole monetary fabric. Before all of
this appropriation is called for, the Trea-
sury must necessarily be given means of
obtaining new supplies. New war ap-
propriations for the army and navy have
been made, but no new supplies have been
obtained for the Treasury. Can any one
be so blind as not to see why the silver
group in the Senate willingly voted for
such measures, which must deplete the
Treasury and imperil the gold reserve,
but yet refuse to vote for bonds by which
alone the Treasury can obtain funds
enough to prevent the dissipation of the
gold reserve?
	It should be borne in mind that the
silver men are intrenched in the Senate,
and are watching vigilantly for a chance
to bring in the silver standard. Unable

	1 (1.) An additional tax on beer of one dol-
lar per barrel.
	(2.) Stamp taxes, as in the act of 1860.
	(3.) An additional tax on tobacco.
	(4.) The issue of short-time Treasury certi
to accomplish this task against the pre-
sent House and the veto of the President,
it would he their strategy, of course, to
gain by negative what it is inipossible to
effect by positive measures. An upheaval
brought on by war would be their oppor-
tunity; and by their control of the Senate
almost any fiscal legislation is at their
mercy. Having once put ourselves in
the position where our Treasury requires
fiscal enactments, we must accept what
the Senate will allow us. It does not re-
quire much imagination to see that in this
passion for war the silver group hope to
find the opportunity they lost in 1896.
The presence of Mr. Bryan in Washing-
ton, and the introduction by Mr. Teller
of the resolution of recognition of Cuba
against the wishes of the administration,
showed clearly their purpose to outbid
the Republican party by radical action.
	The proposed scheme 1 for providing
funds to carry on the war, given to the
public, has in the main a rational foun-
dation. There is, nevertheless, a lurking
danger in the proposition to adapt the
loan to popular subscription. For that
purpose a fixed price is necessary. Fix-
ing the interest at three per cent and the
price at par by no means makes it sure
that any large part of the loan will he
taken, unless the national credit happens
to be exactly met by this adjustment. If
the market judgment varies from this
rate, then we shall repeat the experience
of the civil war. There is the more rea-
son for doubt on this point, because it
seems to be assumed that the act will
provide for the payment of principal and
interest on the bonds in coin, on the
ground that an express requirement of
gold would not be adopted by Congress.
But if it is well understood that the word
gold cannot be introduced, that indi-
cates a doubt as to the future means of

ficates, bearing interest to provide for emergen-
cy needs.
	(5.) A popular bond issue of $300,000,000 in
denominations of fifty dollars, bearing three per
cent interest and sold at par.</PB>

payment for principal and interest. This
doubt will affect the price of the bonds,
and a fixed price may be again the cause
of disaster.
	The tax on bank checks is, of course,
a tax not upon the banks, but upon those
who use checks instead of ordinary forms
of money. Its effect being to tax one
form of currency to the exclusion of
other forms, it will to that extent lower
the efficiency and convenience of our
monetary system. So far as it limits
this means of exchanging goods, it will
be a commercial disadvantage, but it will
yield considerable revenue.
	The possibility of enormous expendi-
tures before we have put our monetary
system in order is unpleasant to contem-
plate. If the need of a careful revision
of our legislation had become imperative
when we were at peace with the world,
how much more necessary  indeed, how
much more essential to our safety  is
it in the presence of war! All the rea-
sons which could be urged for monetary
ref orin six months ago have tenfold more
weight to-day. The very vitality of our
credit, of our capacity to borrow, de-
pends upon the certainty as to our stan-
dard. But Congress has not yet defined
whether its bonds are payable in gold or
in silver (should we by any emergency
be forced to part with our small gold re-
serve). The unmistakable plan of the
silver group in the Senate to antagonize
the administration in order to gain po-
litical advantage shows what we must
face.
	When the House bill for war revenue
was sent to the Senate, the finance corn-
mittee changed its whole character by a
bold proposition to issue $150,000,000
niore United States notes, and to coin


	1 The resolutions of the Senate, to which the
Republican House did not agree, contained two
plain conflicts with the Constitution, and a
startling inconsistency. First, Congress has no
power to recognize the independence of Cuba;
and second, it has no power to call on the miii-
the seigniorage. At this writing it
cannQt be known what action the Senate
will take on these proposals. That a
new issue of greenbacks should even be
mentioned is itself the strongest argu-
ment for the early retirement of those
now outstanding; because it proves, what
has long been prophesied, the danger
that their mere existence in our currency
will suggest an improper issue in a time
of emergency. As to coining the sci-
gniorage, that is a proposal to coin what
does not exist. The profits on coining
silver have been covered into the general
funds of the Treasury, and they have
been used to meet past demands. There
is little or nothing to-day in the Trea-
sury with which to meet the difference
 if called for  between the face and
the market value of our silver coins for
whose circulation at par we are respon-
sible. The silver bullion now held be-
hind the Treasury notes of 1890 is not
seigniorage. To coin the seigniorage
would increase the number of over-val-
ued silver dollars which must be kept at
par in gold, without adding one cent to
the reserves held to maintain these dol-
lars and other currency at par. In short,
the two amendments of the finance com-
mittee above mentioned aim directly at
weakening the power of the Treasury
to keep its demand obligations redeem-
able in gold. What must one think of
the patriotism of those who would try
to take advantage of the perils of war
to bring about that which they failed to
obtain by the ballot in days of peace?
The suggestions of the Senate commit-
tee, like the appropriation of the $50,-
000,000, are ominous reminders of our
errors in 1862. May we yet be saved
from them!

tion of the Cuban republic was accompanied
by a noisy announcement to that unlocated au-
thority of the intention of the United States to
regulate its affairs for it.</PB>

	MR. RYDER was going to give a ball.
There were several reasons why this was
an opportune time for such an event.
	Mr. Ryder might aptly be called the
dean of the Blue Veins. The original
Blue Veins were a little society of col-
ored persons organized in a certain North-
ern city shortly after the war. Its pur-
pose was to establish and maintain cor-
rect social standards among a people
whose social condition presented almost
unlimited room for improvement. By
accident, combined perhaps with some
natural affinity, the society consisted of
individuals who were, generally speak-
ing, more white than black. Some en-
vious outsider made the suggestion that
no one was eligible for membership who
was not white enough to show blue veins.
The suggestion was readily adopted by
those who were not of the favored few,
and since that time the society, though
possessing a longer and more pretentious
name, had been known far and wide as
the Blue Vein Society, and its mem-
bers as the Blue Veins.
	The Blue Veins did not allow that any
such requirement existed for admission
to their circle, but, on the contrary, de-
clared that character and culture were
the only things considered; and that if
most of their members were light-colored,
it was because such persons, as a rule,
had had better opportunities to qualify
themselves for membership. Opinions
differed, too, as to the usefulness of the
society. There were those who had been
known to assail it violently as a glaring
example of the very prejudice from which
the colored race had suffered most; and
later, when such critics had succeeded in
getting on the inside, they had been heard
to maintain with zeal and earnestness
that the society was a life-boat, an an-
chor, a bulwark and a shield, ~- a pillar
of cloud by day and of fire by night, to
guide their people through the social wil-
derness. Another alleged prerequisite
for Blue Vein membership was that of
free birth; and while there was really
no such requirement, it is doubtless true
that very few of the members would have
been unable to meet it if there had been.
If there were one or two of the older
members who had come up from the
South and from slavery, their history pre-

to rob their servile origin of its grosser
aspects.

eligibility, it is true that the Blue Veins
had their notions on these subjects, and
that not all of them were equally liberal
in regard to the things they collectively
disclaimed. Mr. Ryder was one of the
most conservative. Though he had not
been among the founders of the society,
but had come in some years later, his
genius for social leadership was such that
he had speedily become its recognized
adviser and head, the custodian of its
standards, and the preserver of its tra-
ditions. He shaped its social policy,
was active in providing for its entertain-

it sometimes did, he fanned the embers

THE WIFE OF HIS YOUTH.

I.

	MR. RYDER was going to give a ball.
There were several reasons why this was
an opportune time for such an event.
	Mr. Ryder might aptly be called the
dean of the Blue Veins. The original
Blue Veins were a little society of col-
ored persons organized in a certain North-
ern city shortly after the war. Its pur-
pose was to establish and maintain cor-
rect social standards among a people
whose social condition presented almost

those who were not of the favored few,
and since that time the society, though
possessing a longer and more pretentious

the Blue Vein Society, and its mem-
bers as the Blue Veins.
	The Blue Veins did not allow that any
such requirement existed for admission
to their circle, but, on the contrary, de-
clared that character and culture were
the only things considered; and that if
most of their members were light-colored,
it was because such persons, as a rule,
had had better opportunities to qualify
themselves for membership. Opinions
differed, too, as to the usefulness of the
society. There were those who had been

derness. Another alleged prerequisite
for Blue Vein membership was that of

no such requirement, it is doubtless true
that very few of the members would have
been unable to meet it if there had been.
If there were one or two of the older
members who had come up from the

sented enough romantic circumstances
to rob their servile origin of its grosser
aspects.
	While there were no such tests of

had their notions on these subjects, and
that not all of them were equally liberal

was such as to confer distinction upon
them. His features were of a refined

a young man, and obtaining employment
in the office of a railroad company as
messenger had in time worked himself</PB>

up to the position of stationery clerk,
having charge of the distribution of the
office supplies for the whole company.
Although the lack of early training had
hindered the orderly development of a
naturally fine mind, it had not prevent-
ed him from doing a great deal of read-
ing or from forming decidedly literary
tastes. Poetry was his passion. He could
repeat whole pages of the great Eng-
lish poets; and if his pronunciation was
sometimes faulty, his eye, his voice, his
gestures, would respond to the changing
sentiment with a precision that revealed
a poetic soul and disarmed criticism. He
was economical, and had saved money;
he owned and occupied a very comfort-
able house on a respectable street. His
residence was handsomely furnished, con-
taining among other things a good libra-
ry, especially rich in poetry, a piano, and
some choice engravings. He generally
shared his house with some young couple,
who looked after his wants and were
company for him; for Mr. Ryder was a
single man. In the early days of his
connection with the Blue Veins he had
been regarded as quite a catch, and ladies
and their mothers had maneuvred with
much ingenuity to capture him. Not,
however, until Mrs. Molly Dixon visited
Groveland had any woman ever made
him wish to change his condition to that
of a married man.
	Mrs. Dixon had come to Groveland
from Washington in the spring, and be-
fore the summer was over she had won
Mr. Ryders heart. She possessed many
attractive qualities. She was much
younger than he; in fact, he was old
enough to have been her father, though
no one knew exactly how old he was.
She was whiter than he, and better edu-
cated. She had moved in the best col-
ored society of the country, at Washing-
ton, and had taught in the schools of
that city. Such a superior person had
been eagerly welcomed to the Blue Vein
Society, and had taken a leading part
in its activities. Mr. Ryder had at first
been attracted by her charms of person,
for she was very good looking and not over
twenty-five; then by her refined man-
ners and by the vivacity of her wit. Her
husband had been a government clerk,
and at his death had left a considerable
life insurance. She was visiting friends
in Groveland, and, finding the town and
the people to her liking, had prolonged
her stay indefinitely. She had not
seemed displeased at Mr. Ryders atten-
tions, but on the contrary had given him
every proper encouragement; indeed, a
younger and less cautious man would
long since have spoken. But he had
made up his mind, and had only to de-
termine the time when he would ask
her to be his wife. He decided to give
a ball in her honor, and at some time
during the evening of the ball to offer
her his heart and hand. He had no spe-
cial fears about the outcome, but, with
a little touch of romance, he wanted the
surroundings to be in harmony with his
own feelings when he should have re-
ceived the answer he expected.
	Mr. Ryder resolved that this ball
should mark an epoch in the social
history of Groveland. He knew, of
course,  no one could know better, 
the entertainments that had taken place
in past years, and what must be done to
surpass them. His ball must be worthy
of the lady in whose honor it was to be
given, and must, by the quality of its
guests, set an example for the future.
He had observed of late a growing lib-
erality, almost a laxity, in social matters,
even among members of his own set,
and had several times been forced to
meet in a social way persons whose com-
plexions and callings in life were hardly
up to the standard which he considered
proper for the society to maintain. He
had a theory of his own.
	I have no race prejudice, he would
say, but we people of mixed blood are
ground between the upper and the neth-
er millstone. Our fate lies between ab-
sorption by the white race and extinction</PB>

in the black. The one does nt want us
yet, but may take us in time. The other
would welcome us, but it would be for us
a backward step. With malice towards
none, with charity for all, we must do
the best we can for ourselves and those
who are to follow us. Self-preservation
is the first law of nature.
	his ball would serve by its exclusive-
ness to counteract leveling tendencies,
and his marriage with Mrs. Dixon would
help to further the upward process of
absorption he had been wishing and wait-
ing for.

II.

	The ball was to take place on Friday
night. The house had been put in or-
der, the carpets covered with canvas,
the halls and stairs decorated with palms
and potted plants; and in the afternoon
Mr. Ryder sat on his front porch, which
the shade of a vine running up over a
wire netting made a cool and pleasant
lounging-place. He expected to respond
to the toast The Ladies, at the sup-
per, and from a volume of Tennyson 
his favorite poet  was fortifying him-
self with apt quotations. The volume
was open at A Dream of Fair Women.
His eyes fell on these lines, and he read
theni aloud to judge better of their ef-
fect 
At length II saw a lady within call,
	Stiller than chiselld marble, standing there;
A daughter of the gods, divinely tall,
	And most divinely fair.

He marked the verse, and turning the
page read the stanza beginning, 
0 sweet pale Margaret,
0 rare pale Margaret.

He weighed the passage a moment, and
decided that it would not do. Mrs.
Dixon was the palest lady he expected
at the ball, and she was of a rather rud-
dy complexion, and of lively disposition
and buxom build. So he ran over the
leaves until his eye rested on the de-
scription of Queen Guinevere:
She seemd a part of joyous Spring:
A	gown of grass-green silk she wore,
Buckled with golden clasps before;
A	light-green tuft of plumes she bore
Closed in a golden ring.

She lookd so lovely, as she swayd
The rein with dainty finger-tips,
A man had given all other bliss,
And all his worldly worth for this,
To waste his whole heart in one kiss
Upon her perfect lips.


	As Mr. Ryder murmured these words
audibly, with an appreciative thrill, he
heard the latch of his gate click, and a
light footfall sounding on the steps. He
turned his head, and saw a woman stand-
ing before the door.
	She was a little woman, not five feet
tall, and proportioned to her height.
Although she stood erect, and looked
around her with very bright and rest-
less eyes, she seemed quite old; for her
face was crossed and recrossed with a
hundred wrinkles, and around the edges
of her bonnet could be seen protruding
here and there a tuft of short gray wool.
She wore a blue calico gown of ancient
cut, a little red shawl fastened around
her shoulders with an old-fashioned brass
brooch, and a large bonnet profusely or-
namented with faded red and yellow ar-
tificial flowers. And she was very black,
 so black that her toothless gums, re-
vealed when she opened her mouth to
speak, were not red, but blue. She
looked like a bit of the old plantation
life, summoned up from the past by the
wave of a magicians wand, as the poets
fancy had called into being the gracious
shapes of which Mr. Ryder had just been
reading.
	He rose from his chair and came over
to where she stood.
	Good-afternoon, madam, he said.
	Good-evenin, suh, she answered,
ducking suddenly with a quaint curtsy.
Her voice was shrill and piping, but
softened somewhat by age. Is dis
yere whar Mistuh Ryduh lib, suh ? she
asked, looking around her doubtfully,</PB>

and glancing into the open windows,
through which some of the preparations
for the evening were visible.
	Yes, he replied, with an air of kind-
iy patronage, unconsciously flattered by
her manner, I am Mr. Ryder. Did
you want to see me?
	Yas, sub, ef I aint sturbin of you
too much.
	Not at all. Have a seat over here
behind the vine, where it is cool. What
can I do for you?
	Scuse me, sub, she continued, when
she had sat down on the edge of a chair,
scuse me, sub, I s lookin for my
husban. I heerd you wuz a big man
an had libbed heab a long time, an I
lowed you would nt mm ef I d come
roun an ax you ef you d eber heerd of
a merlatter man by de name er Sam
Taylor quinn roun in de chuches er-
mongs de people fer his wife Liza
Jane?
	Mr. Ryder seemed to think for a mo-
ment.
	There used to be many such cases
right after the war, he said, but it
has been so long that I have forgotten
them. There are very few now. But
tell me your story, and it may refresh
my memory.
	She sat back farther in her chair so
as to be more comfortable, and folded
her withered hands in her lap.
	My name s Liza, she began, Liza
Jane. Wen I wuz young I uster blong
ter Marse Bob Smif, down in ole Mis-
soura. I wuz bawn down dere. Wen
I wuz a gal I wuz married ter a man
named Jim. But Jim died, an after
dat I married a merlatter man named
Sam Taylor. Sam wuz free-bawn, but
his mammy and daddy died, an de wite
folks prenticed him ter my marster fer
ter work fer im tel he wuz growed up.
Sam worked in de fiel, an I wuz de cook.
One day May Ann, ole misss maid,
come rushin out ter de kitchen, an
says she, Liza Jane, ole marse gwine

	Go way fm yere, says I; my

	Don make no diffence. I heerd
ole marse tell ole miss he wuz gwine

fer he needed money, an he knowed
whar he could git a tousan dollars fer
Sam an no questions axed.
	Wen Sam come home fm de fiel,
dat night, I tole him bout ole marse

His time wuz mos up, an he swo dat
wen he wuz twenty-one he would come

I know he d a done it, fer lie thought
a heap er me, Sam did. But wen he

I went back ter de ole home; but Sam

	I s ben lookin fer im eber sence,
she added simply, as though twenty-five
years were but a couple of weeks, an
I knows he s ben lookin fer me. Fer

an I know he s ben huntin fer me all

softly, er he 11 fin me, an den we 11
bofe be as happy in freedom as we wuz

stole over her withered countenance as
she paused a moment, and her bright
eyes softened into a far-away look.</PB>

	This was the substance of the old wo-
mans story. She had wandered a little
here and there. Mr. Ryder was look-
ing at her curiously when she finished.
	How have you lived all these
years? he asked.
	Cookin, suL I s a good cook.
Does you know anybody wat needs a
good cook, suh? I s stoppin wid a cub
lud famly roun de corner yonder tel I

	Do you really expect to find your
husband? He may be dead long ago.
	She shook her head emphatically.
Oh no, he am dead. De signs an
de tokens tells me. I dremp three
nights runnin ony dis las week dat I
foun him.
	He may have married another wo-
man. Your slave marriage would not
have prevented him, for you never lived
with him after the war, and without that
your marriage does nt count.
	Would n make no diffence wid
Sam. He would n marry no yuther
ooman tel he foun out bout me. I

	Perhaps he s outgrown you, and
climbed up in the world where he would

	No, indeed, suh, she replied, Sam

ter nobody ese, fer he wuz one er de
triflines hans on de plantation. I

better sence he run erway, but i am
spectin much.
	You may have passed him on the
street a hundred times during the twen~
ty-five years, and not have known him;
time works great changes.
	She smiled incredulously. I d know
im mongs a hunded men. Fer dey
wuz n no yuther merlatter man like my
man Sam, an I could n be mistook.
I s toted his picture roun wid me twen-
ty-five years.
	May I see it? asked Mr. Ryder.
It might help me to remember whether
I have seen the original.
	As she drew a small parcel from her
bosoms he saw that it was fastened to a
string that went around her neck. Re-
moving several wrappers, she brought to
light an old-fashioned daguerreotype in a
black case. He looked long and intent-
ly at the portrait. It was faded with
time, hut the features were still distinct,
and it was easy to see what manner of
man it had represented.
	He closed the case, and with a slow
movement handed it back to her.
	I dont know of any man in town
who goes by that name, he said, nor
have I heard of any one making such
inquiries. But if you will leave me your
address, I will give the matter some at-
tention, and if I find out anything I will
let you know.
	She gave him the number of a house
in the neighborhood, and went away, af-
ter thanking him warmly.
	He wrote down the address on the fly-
leaf of the volume of Tennyson, and,
when she had gone, rose to his feet and
stood looking after her curiously. As
she walked down the street with mincing
step, he saw several persons whom she
passed turn and look back at her with a
smile of kindly amusement. When she
had turned the corner, he went upstairs
to his bedroom, and stood for a long
time before the mirror of his dressing-
case, gazing thoughtfully at the reflec-
tion of his own face.


III,

	At eight oclock the ballroom was a
blaze of light and the guests had begun
to assemble; for there was a literary
programme and some routine business</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00066" SEQ="0066" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="60">	430	The Ws~fe of his Youth.

of the society to be gone through with
before the dancing. A black servant in
evening dress waited at the door and di-
rected the guests to the dressing-rooms.
	The occasion was long memorable
among the colored people of the city;
not alone for the dress and display, but
for the high average of intelligence and
culture that distinguished the gathering
as a whole. There were a number of
school-teachers, several young doctors,
three or four lawyers, some profession-
al singers, an editor, a lieutenant in the
United States army spending his fur-
lough in the city, and others in vari-
ous polite callings; these were colored,
though most of them would not have at-
tracted even a casual glance because of
any marked difference from white peo-
ple. Most of the ladies were in evening
costume, and dress coats and dancing-
pumps were the rule among the men.
A band of string music, stationed in an
alcove behind a row of palms, played
popular airs while the guests were ga-
thering.
	The dancing began at half past nine.
At eleven oclock supper was served.
Mr. Ryder had left the ballroom some
little time before the intermission, but
reappeared at the supper-table. The
spread was worthy of the occasion, and
the guests did full justice to it. When
the coffee had been served, the toast-
master, Mr. Solomon Sadler, rapped for
order. He made a brief introductory
speech, complimenting host and guests,
and then presented in their order the
toasts of the evening. They were re-
sponded to with a very fair display of
after-dinner wit.
	The last toast, said the toast-mas-
ter, when he reached the end of the list,
	is one which must appeal to us all.
There is no one of us of the sterner sex
who is not at some time dependent upon
woman,  in infancy for protection, in
manhood for companionship, in old age
for care and comforting. Our good host
has been trying to live alone, but the
fair faces I see around me to-night prove
that he too is largely dependent upon
the gentler sex for most that makes life
worth living,  the society and love of
friends,  and rumor is at fault if he
does not soon yield entire subjection to
one of them. Mr. Ryder will now re-
spond to the toast,  The Ladies.
	There was a pensive look in Mr. Ry-
ders eyes as he took the floor and adjust-
ed his eyeglasses. He began by speak-
ing of woman as the gift of Heaven to
man, and after some general observa-
tions on the relations of the sexes lie
said: But perhaps the quality which
most distinguishes woman is her fidelity
and devotion to those she loves. His-
tory is full of examples, but has recorded
none more striking than one which only
to-day came under my notice.
He then related, simply but effective-
ly, the story told by his visitor of the
afternoon. He told it in the same soft
dialect, which came readily to his lips,
while the company listened attentively
and sympathetically. For the story had
awakened a responsive thrill in many
hearts~ There were some present who
had seen, and others who had heard
their fathers and grandfathers tell, the
wrongs and sufferings of this past gen-
eration, and all of them still felt, in
their darker moments, the shadow hang
ing over them. Mr. Ryder went on : 
Such devotion and such confidence
are rare even among women. There are
many who would have searched a year,
some who would have waited five years,
a few who might have hoped ten years;
but for twenty-five years this woman
has retained her affection for and her
faith in a man she has not seen or heard
of in all that time.
	She came to me to-day in the hope
that I might be able to help her find this
long-lost husband. And when she was
gone I gave my fancy rein, and imagined
a case I will put to you.
	Suppose that this husband, soon af-
ter his escape, had learned that his wife</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00067" SEQ="0067" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="61">	The Wife of his Youth.	61

had been sold away, and that such inquir-
ies as he could make brought no informa-
tion of her whereabouts. Suppose that
he was young, and she much older than
he; that he was light, and she was black;
that their marriage was a slave mar-
riage, and legally binding only if they
chose to make it so after the war. Sup-
pose, too, that he made his way to the
North, as some of us have done, and
there, where he had larger opportuni-
ties, had improved them, and had in the
course of all these years grown to be as
different from the ignorant boy who ran
away from fear of slavery as the day is
from the night. Suppose, even, that he
had qualified himself, by industry, by
thrift, and by study, to win the friend-
ship and be considered worthy the soci-
ety of such people as these I see around
me to-night, gracing my board and fill-
ing my heart with gladness; for I am
old enough to rememher the day when
such a gathering would not have been
possible in this land. Suppose, too,
that, as the years went by, this mans
memory of the past grew more and
more indistinct, until at last it was rare-
ly, except in his dreams, that any image
of this bygone period rose before his
mind. And then suppose that accident
should bring to his knowledge the fact
that the wife of his youth, the wife he
had left behind him,  not one who bad
walked by his side and kept pace with
him in his upward struggle, but one
upon whom advancing years and a labo-
rious life had set their mark,  was alive
and seeking him, but that he was abso-
lutely safe from recognition or discov-
ery, unless he chose to reveal himself.
My friends, what would the man do?
I will suppose that he was one who loved
lipuor, and tried to deal justly with all
men. I will even carry the case fur-
ther, and suppose that perhaps he had
set his heart upon another, whom he
had hoped to call his own. What would
he do, or rather what ought he to do, in
such a crisis of a lifetime?
	It seemed to me that he might hesi-
tate, and I imagined that I was an old
friend, a near friend, and that he had
come to me for advice; and I argued
the case with him. I tried to discuss it
impartially. After we had looked upon
the matter from every point of view, I
said to him, in words that we all know:
This above all: to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.

Then, finally, I put the question to him,
Shall you acknowledge her?
	And now, ladies and gentlemen,
friends and companions, I ask you, what
should he have done?
	There was something in Mr. Ryders
voice that stirred the hearts of those
who sat around him. It suggested more
than mere sympathy with an imaginary
situation; it seemed rather in the nature
of a personal appeal. It was observed,
too, that his look rested more especially
upon Mrs. Dixon, with a mingled ex-
pression of renunciation and inquiry.
	She bad listened, with, parted lips and
streaming eyes. She was the first to
speak: He should have acknowledged
her.
	Yes, they all echoed, he should
have acknowledged her.
	My friends and companions, re-
sponded Mr. Ryder, I thank you, one
and all. It is the answer I expected,
for I knew your hearts.
	He turned and walked toward the
closed door of an adjoining room, while
every eye followed him in wondering
curiosity. He came back in a moment,
leading by the hand his visitor of the af-
ternoon, who stood startled and trembling
at the sudden plunge into this scene of
brilliant gayety. She was neatly dressed
in gray, and wore the white cap of an
elderly woman.
	Ladies and gentlemen, he said,
this is the woman, and I am the man,
whose story I have told you. Permit
me to introduce to you the wife of my
youth.

A SOULS PILGRIMAGE: EXTRACTS FROM AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

	AFTER a youth spent in study under
the cur6 of my native village of Vars,
and in the college at Gray, near Dijon,
I went up in my twenty-fifth year to
continue my studies in Paris.
	On arriving there  in March, 1843
 I immediately put myself under the
direction of the most celebrated and cer-
tainly the most gifted of all the Jesuits
I have ever met, lire de Ravignan, the
Lenten preacher of Notre Dame, and
the contemporary of Lacordaire, who at
that time preached the Advent course in
the same cathedral. It was my earnest
desire to prepare myself in the best pos-
sible way to fill as worthily as I could
the sacred duties of the ministry. Hav-
ing made sure of a means of living by
setting aside two or three hours each
day to teaching, I devoted the rest of
my time to personal culture. Seldom
has a young man had finer opportunities
for intellectual growth than I had at
this time. For France, the last years
of Louis Philippe were perhaps the most
brilliant of the century. In every de-
partment of learning and letters talent
was represented by illustrious men: in
poetry, Victor Hugo and Lamartine; in
Parliament, Berryer and Montalembert;
in the government, Guizot and Thiers;
at the Sorbonne, Cousin, Jules Simon,
Lenormant, Ozanam, and Cwur; at the
Coll6ge de France, Michelet and Quinet;
in the pulpit, Lacordaire and de Ravi-
gnan.
	I was anxious to learn something from
each of these remarkable men. My
Sundays were spent in listening to fa-
mous preachers. During the rest of the
week I distributed my time between the
Sorbonne, the Chamber of Deputies, and
the Chamber of Peers. Presently, to
my great delight, I found myself in rela-
tion with such men as Berryer and Mon-
talembert, Jules Simon and Ozanam, La-
cordaire and de Ravignan. The last,
as my spiritual director, proved a warm
friend as well as a wise and trustwor-
thy guide. I retain a sweet remern-
brance of many intimate conversations
with him. His was not only a holy but
a liberal spirit. I was not surprised,
later, when I heard it said that he
thought of reasserting his independence
by asking the general of the Jesuits to
release him from his vows.
	A trait which exhibited the nobility
of his feelings and the largeness of his
views appeared in one of our conversa-
tions. One day, troubled with doubts,
I opened my heart to him, and, encour-
aged by his evident sympathy, ventured
to ask the question, Is there not, my
father, some way of recognizing what is
true from what is false in religious doc-
trine, by which one may avoid the ne-
cessity of constant reference to authori-
ties, so many of which simply confuse the
mind by their conflicting statements?
	There is a way, he replied, which
in the case of such doubt I myself fol-
low, and which I recommend to you.
Every doctrine which tends to elevate
the mind and enlarge the heart is true,
and every doctrine which works the con-
trary effect is false. Follow this prin-

for it. I have done so, and am satis-
fied.

repast, he laid before them a plan by

the coming week, to visit one or two poor
families of the neighborhood, and report
to him on the following Sunday. The</PB></P>

enthusiasm of the young men for so prac-
tical a form of benevolent work soon
developed, and shortly it became advisa-
ble to form the little group into a society,
the object of which should be just such
simple works of charity. From that
modest beginning in the library of this
large - hearted man the association has
grown until to-day it numbers more than
two million members. You may be sure
that I was glad of an opportunity to be
associated with such a band of zealous
men.
	Another society to which it was my
privilege to belong was Le Cercle Ca-
tholique de la Rue de Grenelle, which
was founded at this time with the object
of banding together Catholics of liber-
al views, clerics as well as laymen. It
counted among its members such men
as Lacordaire, Ozanam, Montalembert,
de Falloux, de Montigny, and Riancey.
	It was my honor to represent this
society in Dublin at the funeral of the
celebrated Irish liberator, Daniel OCon-
nell. Never shall I forget the sight that
greeted us on our arrival in Dublin Bay.
A vast throng had gathered on the quay,
and after a solemn and awed silence
suddenly burst into a wail of lamenta-
tion such as it is given a man only once
to hear. It seemed as if the hearts of
the bereaved people were breaking with
grief. As the cort6ge moved from the
quay the multitude reverently followed
the catafalque, and kept up a constant
dirge until the remains of their hero
were deposited within the church where
the funeral service was to be held on the
morrow. Few things could have been
more imposing than that solemn service
and the great procession which attended
the body to its last resting-place. It
was evident, indeed, that Ireland had
lost one of her chief sons, and her peo-
ple mourned for him as a mother mourns
for her best beloved.
	Some weeks after our return to Paris,
P~re Lacordaire pronounced the funeral
oration of Daniel OConnell at Notre
Dame. On the evening of the same day
a dinner was given to John OConnell,
son of the great statesman, by the Baron
de Montigny at his superb h6tel (for-
merly the hOtel Montmorency) in the
Rue de Babylone. Sixty guests were
present, including many church dignita-
ries, statesmen, journalists, and other dis-
tinguished men. It was the 22d of Feb-
ruary, 1848,  a day destined to prove a
memorable one in the history of France.
Shortly before we sat down, the populace
had begun to assemble in the streets,
and the crowds seemed to be moving to-
ward the Champs Elys~es. A valet was
dispatched every quarter of an hour to
bring us news of what was happening.
As the reports grew more alarming, the
guests became more preoccupied. After
dinner the company broke up into little
groups to discuss the situation. A mes-
senger presently brought us more seri-
ous tidings, so that the Baron de Ville-
quier exclaimed, Why, it seems a veri-
table mob!  To which the prophetic
Berryer replied, Take care that it is
not a revolution! Two days later
Louis Philippe was obliged to flee from
the Tuileries, and restless France found
herself once more a nation without a
ruler.
	It was during the outbreak in June of
the same year that the heroic death of
the saintly Archbishop of Paris, Mon-
seigneur Aifre, occurred. The soul of
this devout man was deeply moved by
the spirit of strife among the people.
It cut him to the heart to see Paris on
the verge of a fratricidal war, and Gods
call seemed clear to him, as the spiritual
father of the community, not to spare
himself in any endeavor to restore or-
der and promote peace. Accordingly,
on the morning of the 27th he pro-
ceeded to the scene of the conflict and
mounted the barricades, to plead with
the populace on the one hand and the
soldiery on the other. Scarcely had lie
uttered the words My children when
a shot fired from a neighboring build-</PB>

ing pierced him, and he fell dead be-
fore the eyes of the mob. This tragic
event was enough. A horror seemed to
seize ~very one, and from that hour the
insurrection ceased. Truly the good
shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
	It may be proper to speak a word
about the power of the pulpit in Paris
at this time. Perhaps the two most
eminent preachers that France has pro-
duced are Bossuet and Lacordaire. Both
were the pride of Dijon, their native city.
The superiority of Bossuet appeared in
what lie said, that of Lacordaire in the
way in which he said it. The latters
eloquence corresponds precisely to the
word attributed to Demosthenes, and re-
peated by Massillon. When asked what
were the essential elements of oratory,
the illustrious Greek is said to have re-
plied : First, action ; second, action;
third, action.
	I recall an occasion when this princi-
ple in the preaching of Lacordaire was
illustrated. One Sunday, Abb6 Castan,
nephew of Archbishop Aifre, and I found
ourselves almost lost in the immense
crowd pouring into Notre Dame to hear
the great preacher. The subject he was
to treat was the struggle between good
and evil, the conflict between the powers
of the world and the Church of God.
He opened with a paraphrase of the first
verses of the second Psalm: Quare
fremuerunt gentes? Presently, as the
idea began to unfold itself to his mar-
velous imagination, his thought rose to
such a height that my friend whispered
to me, He cannot continue in that
strain! It was true. Human lan-
guage failed him. Yet, standing there,
his face illumined with the great thought,
his body swaying under the inspiration
of the mighty truth which his tongue
refused to utter, he continued his ges-
tures with such descriptive force that,
under the action of that mute eloquence,
the assembly seemed to shudder. It was
only a few seconds, perhaps, though it
seemed to me many minutes. Then the
preacher slowly drew back his arm and
solemnly laid his hand over his heart.
After a moment of absolute stillness,
the entire audience gave vent to its feel-
ings in one spontaneous outburst of ap-
plause.
	On the following Sunday we were
again in our places, and before the
address the Archbishop of Paris felt
compelled to request the congregation to
remember the sacred character of the
place, and to refrain from any outward
expression of approval. But such was the
eloquence of Lacordaire in pursuing the
same theme that erelong the archbishop
himself was betrayed into an unconscious
clapping of hands, which was en9ugh to
lift an irksome restraint from an audi-
ence hardly able to suppress its feelings.
	At this time the accession to our ranks
of John Henry Newman and other dis-
tinguished members of the Anglican
communion inspired the champions of
Romanism in France with the belief that
England was ripe for the papacy. Fre-
quent meetings were held among us, and
our enthusiasm and zeal for this great
end were heightened. I was free to do
as I pleased at this time, and being
deeply moved by the bright prospects
before our Church in Great Britain I de-
termined to give myself to the work of
conversion, and to devote my energies
to an enterprise which seemed destined
to contribute so largely to the glory and
power of the Holy See.
	My friends were most cordial in their
approval of this resolve, and in many
happy ways expressed an interest in the
step I was about to take. Some of the
sweetest evidences of their regard were
the books and other gifts they bestowed
upon me; among them was a very ten-
der souvenir from Charles (then Abb~)
Gounod. On the evening before my de-
parture this charming man brought me
his surplice, berretta, and other personal
belongings. These were the more pre-
cious to me since, shortly after this, Gou-
nod gave up the idea of following the</PB>

sacred ministry, in order to devote him-
self without reserve to that noble art
which has made his name immortal.

	Arriving in London, I set out imme-
diately to report myself to Cardinal
Wiseman for such service as he should
think me fitted to undertake. As I had
not yet learned to speak English plainly,
it was arranged that I should preach as
occasion offered at the French church
of this great capital, and on Sundays
celebrate the military mass at Wool-
wich for the Roman Catholic soldiers of
the garrison. It was not long before
I gained familiarity with English, and
his Eminence was able to transfer me
to the charge of the Catholic mission re-
gently established at Canterbury. Here
I preached my first English sermons.
	England until then had been looked
upon as a missionary territory by the
Latin Church, and, as was the custom in
all countries of this character, the Ro-
man authority was represented, not by
bishops, but by apostolic vicars, of whom
at this time there were four. In 1850
Pius IX. divided the country into Cath-
olic provinces, and appointed a bishop
for ea~h of them. This bold act on the
part of a foreign prelate aroused the
indignation of the English people, and
provoked widespread and violent opposi-
tion. Every evening the streets of Lon-
don were thronged with long and noisy
processions, in which the Pope was car-
ried about in effigy and subjected to all
manner of insult. I suffered more than
I can say from this blasphemous abuse,
as it seemed to me, of the head of our
holy religion, and I felt it my duty to
protest, no matter how insignificant my
protestation might be. Accordingly, I
published successively two tracts in fa-
vor of the papacy,  entitled Rome and
the Holy Scriptures, and Rome and the
Primitive Church,  with the hope that
some Protestant minds might see the
grounds of our claims and the justice of
the step taken by his Holiness Pius IX.
	VOL. LXXXII.  NO. 489.	5
	These publications attracted more no-
tice than I could have hoped for. By
the Catholic press they were heralded as
timely utterances, and were spoken of as
logical and conclusive arguments for the
papal supremacy. But above all other
opinions I appreciated that expressed in
the following letter: 

	... I received with true pleasure your
pamphlets and your good letter, my dear
abb6; I thank you with all my heart.
God has truly made you an Apostle of
England. Continue to spread the good
news. I admire the manner in which
you are able to write and speak in Eng-
lish. The remembrance of you, be sure
of it, remains faithful in the depths of
my soul. Au revoir, then, till it please
the Lord. Believe in my very tender
attachment.
DE RAVIGNAN, S. J.
PARIs, 21 February, 1851.


	The Protestant journals whose atten-
tion was excited by these pamphlets of
course judged them differently. One
among them, Bells Weekly Messenger,
published a series of articles in which
the Scriptural texts and historic ref er-
ences were the object of severe criticism.
The author of these articles, Mr. Charles
Hastings Collette, one of the glories of
Oxford, and a man deeply versed in the
writings of the Fathers as well as the
history of the first Christian ages, in a
polite letter in which he gave me entire
credit for sincerity, announced to me his
intention of pointing out that the state-
ments upon which my arguments were
founded were either fabrications or else
falsely stated. Sure of having advanced
only those points which conform to the
teaching of the most esteemed authors
of Catholic history, and acting besides un-
der the impression which prevails among
Roman Catholics, namely, that honesty
is not to be expected from Protestants
in religious controversy, I did not feel
it my duty to reply to his very civil note.</PB>

My silence did not seem to discourage
him, for in the course of a few days he
wrote me four other letters, which in
turn failed to elicit a reply.
	One morning I heard a knock at the
door of the house where I lived, and, as
the servant was absent, I answered the
call. I found myself face to face with
a gentleman of distinguished appearance,
who handed me his card, and to my as-
tonishment I read the name of my corre-
spondent and adversary, Charles Has-
tings Collette. Common courtesy obliged
me to receive him. Without ado he
announced the purpose of his visit by
repeating in a decided voice what he
had written; declaring that he had per-
fect faith in my sincerity, that the pam-
phlets were marked with the stamp of
honesty, and that had it been otherwise
he would have disdained any dealings
with me. Then he said that he was
ready to prove to me that I had been
mistaken in many of the texts quoted
and in most of the supposed facts sub-
mitted in my argument.  Without
doubt, he said, you drew your know-
ledge from the most estimable sources
known to you. But these sources are
far too modern. I ask you but one
thing, and that, as a man of honor, which
I take you to be, you cannot honestly
refuse me. It is to consult, not Protes-
tant books, but the writings of Catholics
of an earlier date than the Council of
Trent, of whose authenticity and author-
ity there can be no question. To this
effect, I pray you to make conscientious
researches in the library of the British
Museum, where such documents abound.
I shall secure you the necessary permis-
sion to consult these works, and as the
librarian is my friend I shall ask him
to help you in your investigations, and
we shall see what conclusion the study
will lead you to.
	By refusing to accede to such a re-
quest I should have given proof of a
want of love for truth; and so sure was
I of my ground and of the historical
validity of my argument that I did not
hesitate to follow the wish of this ardent
and courteous opponent. For a fort-
night I spent all of my afternoons and
part of my evenings in searching those
books which could enlighten me on so
grave a subject. By faithful study I
was able to compare the facts as I had
been taught them with the facts as the
early Church historians stated them.
The result of this investigation was as
painful to me as it was satisfactory to
Mr. Collette. On all the contested points
I found that the weight of authority was
against my position. I will cite one
decisive instance.
	Among all the treatises on dogmatic
theology in use, in my day, in the high
seminaries of the Church, the one most
esteemed was the work of Cardinal Gous-
set, perhaps the greatest Roman theolo-
gian of the century. In this work the
sixth canon of the Council of Nice (A. D.
325) is thus written: Ecelesia Romana
semper habuit primatum. From this
canon one draws the irresistible conclu-
sion that the first ecumenical council, al-
though composed almost exclusively of
bishops from the East, who would natu-
rally look with jealousy upon the grow-
ing influence of the See of Rome, found
itself obliged to witness to the truth of
her supremacy by a special canon, de-
claring that from the beginning Rome
had had the primacy. Surely no more
positive assertion could be made of the
fact which Protestant historians repudi-
ated so decidedly.
	Resting secure in my knowledge of
this canon, I was almost stunned to find
that the original form of the canon, as
enacted by the Council, was quite differ-
ent from what I had been taught. The
sixth canon simply states that Rome has
a relative primacy. The plan before the
Council was to transform the See of
Alexandria into a patriarchate, and the
purport of the canon was, that as the
bishop of Rome had the primacy over
the bishops of the suburbicarian cities,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00073" SEQ="0073" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="67">	A Souls Pilgrimage: Extracts from an Autobiography.	6T

in the same way it was fitting that the
bishop of Alexandria should occupy a
similar rank with regard to the bishops
of Lower Egypt. The part that had
been suppressed in our manuals gave the
subject an entirely different complexion.
	This discovery, and others like it, gave
me a most scvere shock. I requested
the librarian to permit me to carry away
and keep until the next day the collec-
tion of the acts of councils, where I had
found the canons in their original integ-
rity. He consented, and I lost no time
in finding Cardinal Wiseman. I asked
him if there was any doubt as to the au-
thenticity of the sixth canon of Nice as
it is given in our manuals of theology.
None that I know of, he replied. I
then showed him my volume, and said,
It is a Catholic publication; old, it is
true, but only the more to be trusted on
that account. Here are the terms in
which the sixth canon is expressed.
His Eminence appeared very much as-
tonished, and as he remarked that I suf-
fered from something more than aston-
ishinent he advised me not to attach too
much importance to the matter. An in-
terview with my spiritual director, Fa-
ther Brownbill, gave me no more satis-
faction than that with the cardinal. For
the first time in my life I found myself
assailed by doubt, and with no friend to
turn to.
	Now, to entertain doubt is regarded
as one of the greatest sins by the Roman
Church, a species of interior apostasy, to
be dealt with in the most rigorous way;
and in the teachings of the masters of
the spiritual life there is, for the tempta-
tions against faith as for those against
purity, one sole remedy,  flight. After
a long struggle I determined to fly, and
resolved to have nothing more to do
with Protestants, to avoid all matters
of controversy, and to devote myself ex-
clusively to works of zeal in Catholic
countries.
	The times were favorable for this pur-
pose. The Secular Jubilee was about
to be celebrated in France by missions
in the leading churches. I had been in-
vited to take part in several of these mis-
sions as preacher and confessor. This
now appeared to me providential; the
more so as the subjects treated in the pul-
pit on such occasions  sin, repentance,
death, judgment, aiid the like  are al-
most strangers to controversy. I accept-
ed the invitations, therefore, with a kind
of desperate gratitude, and during more
than two months passed the greater part
of my time in the pulpit and the confes-
sional.
	The day caine when, although I had
still many engagements, I found myself
completely worn out and forced to think
of rest. After that, recalling the word
of the sage, that the best writings on re-
ligion are those forbidden by the Con-
gregation of the Index, I allowed myself
to pass over this interdiction, and among
other works to read with a lively inter-
est LHistoire de la Civilisation en Eu-
rope et en France, by M. Guizot. The
manifest spirit of sincerity, the largeness
of view, the historical science, which this
work reveals impressed me so deeply,
and produced such a change in my man-
ner of appreciating things, that I felt
sure its talented author could help me
in my present dilemma. To unburden
myself to this great man might seem to
him a strange tribute to his genius, yet
so deep was my longing for counsel and
guidance just at this time that I felt such
a course was justifiable, and believed
that he would not take my confidence
amiss.
	My plea was addressed simply to
M. Guizot, Paris; and though I looked
anxiously and long for an answer, to
my deep disappointment none came.
Whether the lettey never reached its
destination, or whether M. Guizot mis-
trusted its motive, I had no means of
ascertaining. I have come to believe it
was never received.
	Judging it inopportune to take any
one else into my confidence, I resolved</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00074" SEQ="0074" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="68">68 A Souls Pilgrimage: Extracts from an Autobiography.

to think and act for myself and on my
own responsibility. The more I studied
and reflected, the more my faith in the
fundamental doctrines of Romanism
weakened, and I felt that before long
not only my opinions, but also my con-
science would impose upon me the duty
of abjuration. As such a step could not
but bring me personally the gravest con-
sequences, deeply afflict my best friends,
and, worst of all, carry desolation into
the bosom of my family, I felt bound to
make a last effort by going to Rome and
studying the system on the spot in its
immediate application.
	As I had not revealed to any of my
friends what was passing within me,
when they learned that I was going to
the capital of the Roman world they en-
tirely misinterpreted the object of the
journey and congratulated me on my re-
solution. Several prelates, the Cardinal
Archbishop of Besan~on among them,
sent me letters of recommendation of
the most flattering kind. All supposed
I was about to make what is called
a pilgrimage ad limina apostolorum.
They had a natural reason for believing
this, as I had received from the Vatican
special privileges, and more recently had
been extended the widest powers in the
matter of indulgences, such as the altare
privile~,uiatunzpersonale, of which I have
the titles still in my possession.
	It was my intention to remain six
months in the Holy City. Circumstances
compelled me to leave at the end of a
month; yet during that brief period I
saw and learned enough to satisfy me
that the capital of the Roman world was
the last place for one in my frame of mind
to visit. It may be that I was not in a
condition to judge impartially. Perhaps
the temper of my thoughts was over-crit-
ical, too susceptible to adverse impres-
sions. I had resolved, it is true, to in-
vestigate fearlessly and study frankly
all that bore upon my religious position.
Nevertheless, every private interest, home
ties, the love and respect of friends, pre
sent position and future prospects, would
naturally have induced me to see things
in their most favorable light. If the
facts were to lead me to separate from
the Church of Rome, it would be only
because the facts were too glaring and
emphatic to be glossed over.
	I pass by the vexatious to which, on
arriving at Civitk Vecchia, I was subject-
ed, at the hands of the gendarmes, the
customs officers, and the countless horde
of faquini. Suffice it to say that I
reached the Eternal City at last, poorer
in pocket, but richer in experience.
	As soon as I was settled in fairly com-
fortable lodgings I proceeded to make
myself familiar with the city. The
churches first absorbed my attention.
What shall I say of their dignity and
splendor, their wealth and magnificence?
What shall I say of the vast numbers of
monks and priests and prelates who
throng these stately buildings, and tes-
tify to the power and prestige of this
great church, and lend an air of sanctity
to its ancient seat? Certainly here the
religion of Jesus should be at its best.
Here we should find the purest morality
and the deepest spiritual life. Here
charity and good works, the distinctive
marks of the disciples of Christ, should
abound without measure. Rome should
lead the world in all that is noble and
holy and gracious in religion.
	The pain of a bitter disenchantment
was in si~ore for me. I had been in the
city but a few hours when a revolting
sense of the unreality of its religious life
took possession of me. Every day seemed
to deepen that unwelcome impression.
I found myself going from place to place
in increasing amazement am the squalor
and ignorance and vice visible and open-
ly present at each new turn. Instead
of righteousness and piety and a sweet
reverence among the people, there were
iniquity and uncleanness and degrading
superstition. Education and self-respect,
 those choice fruits of Christianity, 
where had they concealed themselves?</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00075" SEQ="0075" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="69">	A Souls Pilgrimage: Extracts from an Autobiography.	69

On the one hand the luxury of the pre-
lates, on the other the profound misery
of the people; on this side churches of
surpassing stateliness, on that homes of
the poor, unspeakable in their filthiness;
here a cleric in gorgeous attire, there
a beggar in hideous and noisome rags.
How could I escape the shameful mean-
ing of such a contrast! One would in-
deed have had to be a slave to prejudice
to overlook this disgusting travesty of
the religion of Him who came to preach
the gospel to the poor, to heal the
broken-hearted, to set at liberty those
who are bruised.
	And what do these men do, this mul-
titude of priests? I asked myself again
and again. Do they not see the wretch-
ed condition of the people? Have they
no concern for the public distress and
ignorance and immorality? I could
not discover a single sign of a real and
genuine interest in such matters, nor did
I learn of any organized effort to lift the
people from their hapless plight. The
dignitaries of the Church were occupied
with other things. Their time was taken
up with affairs of a more imposing na-
ture: resplendent ceremonies, now at
this altar, now at that; the keeping of
great festivals and the observance of
great occasions. The city seemed wholly
given up to idolatry and enamored with
the superb spectacle of an elaborate wor-
ship. Even this might mean something,
did it only inspire the people with a
deeper reverence and regard for sacred
things. But it was evident that the sol-
emn functions possessed no real solem-
nity; it was not awe of God that held
the crowd, but a stupid wonder and ad-
miration of those gorgeously robed men
who served at the altar. At St. Peters,
the Lateran, St. Paul outside the Walls,
Trinity de Monti, it was always the same,
 a wanton display of religions pomp
and ceremonial, without heart, without
devotion, without any spiritual reality.
	On Christmas I attended the midnight
office at S. Maria Maggiore. The church
was splendid with lights and ornaments;
the ceremony was the greatest possible
display. Among all the princes of the
church I liked the appearance of the
Pope alone. His face was sympathetic,
and he seemed embarrassed by the many
singular honors conferred upon him. The
assembly had the air of taking part in
some worldly gathering rather than in
a religious service. The frivolity of the
people, their free conversation, prevent-
ed one from believing that they were
conscious of being in a holy place. One
may doubt if a single soul carried away
any feeling of edification.
	The feast of the Epiphany found me
at the Sistine Chapel. What a spectacle
is that mass in the presence of the Pope!
The chamberlains grouped like dogs at
the feet of their masters, the cardinals;
the officiating clergy carelessly lolling
on the altar steps in their sacerdotal
vestments, turning their backs upon the
cross and the tabernacle during the sing-
ing; then that meaningless series of
perfunctory honors, kissing of hands,
kissing of the feet of the Pope, which
seems to be given in lieu of the homage
due to the Host upon the altar. Nothing
is present to remind one that it is the
house of God. The triple pontifical
crown everywhere  on the walls right
and left, at the entrance, and in the sanc-
tuary  tells the story truly. It is not
the cross of Christ, but the crown of the
Pontiff, that is reverenced.
	I came away from this service re-
solved to follow the direction of my own
conscience, cost what it might. An acci-
dent served to help me in this decision.
I was boarding in a family whose chief
religious devotion seenied to consist in
reciting the rosary together, in order to
obtain a favorable number at Tombola.
The members of the family knew that I
was a priest, and having observed that,
unlike other priests, I did not say the
daily mass, they indicated in many ways
that they were suspicious of my ortho-
doxy. I had reason to believe that they</PB>

would not keep this suspicion to them-
selves, and so I thought it well to seek
another lodging.
	Seeing on the door of a house on the
Plaza dEspagna the notice Rooms to
let, I entered and ascended the stairs
to examine them. As I passed through
the hail, my eye was caught by a
door-plate hearing the inscription Rev.
Charles Baird, Chaplain of the Ameri-
can Legation. This discovery seemed
to me providential. I had never con-
versed with a Protestant minister. In
obedience to a strange impulse I knocked.
Mr. Baird was within, and received me
with marked politeness. I was a stran-
ger, and yet I found myself in a few mo-
ments explaining to him my peculiar po-
sition. His evident sympathy and kind-
ness inspired me to tell him all, and I
felt more than repaid for my confidence
by his affectionate and tender manner.
After a few comforting and encouraging
words, he said: You cannot doubt my
profound sympathy in the religious crisis
to which you have been led, and I shall
be happy to meet and talk with you again,
but it must not be in this place. Every-
thing which passes in my apartment is
watched. Only a few weeks ago, a monk,
tormented as you now are by doubt, and
who had come to confer with me two
or three times, disappeared; I have not
heard from him nor of him since. I
should not be surprised if it is already
known that you are here. Do not re-
turn to these rooms. I will appoint a
place of meeting where there will not
be the same risk. I promised to do as
Mr. Baird had told me, and left him my
address.
	Some days later, as I was walking
from the Gesii to the Capitol, where
two streets cross, I was suddenly accost-
ed by two men, who threw themselves
upon me, and while one covered my
mouth to prevent an outcry, the other
rifled my pockets. I supposed my purse
had been taken; but no, it was safe in my
pocket. My portfolio, containing many
precious papers,  my passport and let-
ters of recommendation, that from the
Archbishop of Besan~on among them, 
was gone.
	I went at once to the police prefecture,
hard by, and asked to speak with the
prefect himself. I told him what had
occurred, and he expressed surprise. He
inquired if there was any money in the
portfolio. I told him there was nothing
but private papers and letters, valua-
ble to me, but useless to any one else.
Thereupon this worthy officer said, If
these men are ordinary thieves and find
that the contents are of no value to them,
they will probably bring them to us.
You had better leave with us some little
indemnity to pay them for their trouble.
	This affair now appeared to me more
serious than I had thought at first, and
without further delay I sought the office
of the French ambassador. Happily,
he knew me, being, as I was, a member
of Le Cercle Catholique. He seemed
glad to see me, but when I told him
what had just happened his countenance
became grave. Allow me to ask you a
question, he said. How do you stand
from a religious point of view?  I
thought it right to tell him frankly the
reason for my presence in Rome. That
truly grieves me, he replied. You
know I am a Catholic. Nevertheless, in
the present case I must act as an ambas-
sador of France. I know you to be a
reputable citizen. I shall give you a new
passport on this condition: you must
leave Rome in twenty-four hours. For
that time I take you under my protection,
but if you remain longer I will not be
responsible for the outcome. He then
told me the experience of the Abb6 La-
horde, who had been sent to Rome by the
Archbishop of Paris to protest against
the proclamation of the new dogma of the
Immaculate Conception. Upon his ar-
rival he was speedily taken in hand and
shut up in the Castle of St. Angelo. He
was liberated only after severe threats
on the part of the French government.</PB>

	On leaving the ambassador I went at
once to Mr. Baird. What has tiap-
pened does not surprise me, he said,
upon learning of my misadventure.
Well, now that you are in security
for twenty-four hours longer we can
see something of you. Come to-morrow
to our service at ten~ oclock. After-
ward we will breakfast together, and at
one oclock you can take the diligence
for Civita Vecchia.
	I acted according to the desire of my
new friend, in whom I was happy to
find a true Christian gentleman, and on
the morrow I attended for the first time
in my life a Protestant service, and that
in the very centre of Romanism. Dur-
ing my stay in the Holy City this was the
only occasion when I was truly edified
and comforted by a religious service.
In the simplicity and manifest sincerity
of that brief period of devotion I found
what I had failed to find in all the pomp
and ceremony of the great churches, 
an atmosphere of reverence and faith, a
worship of God in spirit and in truth.
	For a year and a half after my de-
parture from Rome I lived in London
and in Dublin, lecturing oii French liter-
ature, and engaging as opportunity pre-
sented in work of a religious character.
All this time my heart was unsatisfied,
and my movements were embarrassed
by the excessive zeal of some of my new-
found Protestant friends. I determined,
therefore, in order to find a place of
freer movement, to go to the United
States. Knowing that Boston was the
capital of mind and the centre of culture
in the great republic, I concluded to take
up my residence there for a time, at
least, in order to see American life and
thought at its best. Of this my journal
speaks more explicitly: 
November 3, 1855. Yesterday a friend
took me to the home of Mr. Longfellow,
the preeminent poet of the New World.
He received us in the room where Wash-
ington had his headquarters, and where
a Frenchman delights to find the name
of Lafayette. Mr. Longfellow invited
me to dine with him to-day, so that my
first dinner in the United States, outside
of a hotel, was at the house of one of
Americas purest glories,  a house ven-
erated as a sanctuary by his countrymen,
 and in the company of several of the
most cultivated minds of Boston; for
Mr. Longfellow, who does nothing by
halves, had also invited to this dinner the
leading professors of the university at
Cambridge. It was a delicate attention,
too, that the dinner was prepared and
served entirely ~t lafran~aise. But what
followed I valued and enjoyed far more
than the dinner. When the twelve other
guests had goiie home, he asked me to
remain in order that we might engage
in more intimate conversation. I shall
not soon forget his charming candor and
warm-hearted sympathy, which quickly
won my confidence and made it easy for
me to speak to him of my personal expe-
riences.
	November 5. Almost by chance I was
introduced to-day to the Bishop of Mas-
sachusetts, the Right Reverend Dr. Man-
ton Eastburn. I was not prepared for
this introduction, and when it was pro-
posed I regretted that my costume was
not appropriate for meeting a person of
such dignity. On seeing his lordship all
awkwardness on my part disappeared.
Not one distinctive mark characterized
this man save his fine presence and
distinguished and affable manners. The
bishop spoke to me as a minister of
Christ, and showed me much kindness.
	-	- The bishop is, with the ministers
under his jurisdiction, the primus inter
pares, a sort of elder brother. Surely,
this manner of being and acting is more
apostolic than that of the superb prelates
under Roman authority.
	November 15. The circle of my ac-
quaintance, and I may say of my friends,
is enlarging every day. They are almost
without exception noble types of human-
ity. Yesterday I was presented to one
71</PB>

especially worthy, a true gentleman and
a member of the American Congress, the
Hon. Robert C. Winthrop. To-day, the
one who now occupies the pulpit of Dr.
Channing, his worthy successor in noble
qualities of heart and soul, Rev. Dr. Ezra
Gannett, came to invite me to dine at his
house with some distinguished men whom
he desired me to know.
	November 25. To-day I can either
boast or reproach myself for having sat
in the assembly of those whom the or-
thodox call infidels. I went to hear
Theodore Parker at the Music Hall, 
Theodore Parker, who is avoided and
disavowcd even by Unitarians. Now I
must confess that in all he said there
was not an idea nor a word that wound-
ed me; on the contrary, this appeared
to be just the atmosphere for my present
state of mind. Mr. Parker, in my sense,
is a logical and truly brave preacher;
the others  I speak, of course, of the
liberals  seem to draw back from the
consequences of the principles they have
laid down. Here is a Protestant indeed,
in the full sense of the word. After the
service I was introduced to Mr. Parker,
who already knew something of my his-
tory, and welcomed me with marked po-
liteness. He invited me to call upon
him for a confidential talk at any time
that I should feel inclined to do so.

	The first year in New England was
most encouraging. My literary confer-
ences met with unexpected success. A
complete course was given in the ball of
the Y. M. C. A. in Boston, and various
series at Cambridge, Lynn, Milton, Na-
hant, and Newport. From all these
places the most gratifying letters came
to me, quite unexpectedly, from several
persons well known in the world of let-
ters; among them, Longfellow, Theodore
Parker, Dr. Hedge, Edmund Quincy,
Wendell Phillips, Lothrop Motley, Bish-
op Eastburn, Charles Brooks, Henry
Tuckerman, Robert C. Winthrop, Rufus
Choate, and Edward Everett.
	Two propositions were just then made
to me: the one, to fill the professorship
of French language and literature in
Washington University, at St. Louis;
the other, to establish a collegiate school
for young ladies at Lexington, Kentucky.
	I went to St. Louis first; but as the
aspect of things there did not appear
favorable, I soon left for Lexington,
where I was already known to the fam-
ily of Senator Duncan. I was also fur-
nished with letters to Mr. Breckinridge,
afterwards Vice - President of the Con-
federacy, the family of Henry Clay,
and several others. One of the largest
and best houses in the city was put at
my disposal, and many pupils were al-
ready enrolled, when an incident hap-
pened which brought all my projects to
a sudden end. One Sunday, in returning
fro~n church, I passed, without know-
ing it, through the slave-market. It was
an open square, where many men had
gathered and were employed in barter-
ing for a female slave. Coming from
Boston, where I had been associated
with Wendell Phillips, Lloyd Garrison,
and others of the abolitionist party, to
which my heart thoroughly belonged, I
could not help in some degree showing
the pain and indignation I felt. This
criticism stirred up bad feelings, which
some of the people did not hesitate to
express so openly that a friend heard
their threats, and lost no time in repeat-
ing them to me. Late that night I was
awakened by a soft rapping upon my
window, which opened upon the broad
piazza of the hotel, and I found there a
young mulatto who was engaged in do-
ing some printing for the school. He
brought news of a plot to tar and fea-
ther me, and in this high - handed and
desperate way to cut short my dangerous
doctrines. I did not propose to retract
what I had said, and so there was no-
thing for it but to leave the place at once.
	New York seemed to me to offer not
only the most favorable opportunities for
my literary efforts, but also a large field</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00079" SEQ="0079" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="73">	A Souls Pilgrimage: E~vtracts from an Autobiography.	73

for study of the many and various phases
of religious belief and activity. I had
but a very few friends in that city, yet
I felt that they were men whom I could
trust. This confidence was not misplaced.
From the moment of my arrival, Hen-
ry Tuckerman, Dr. Henry Bellows, and
others took a most lively interest in my
well-being. It was shortly arranged that
I should give a course of sermons on
unity, in the church of Dr. Bellows, at
the corner of 19th Street and Fourth
Avenue. These sermons niet with a
flattering reception, and drew many peo-
ple of a liberal mind among the vari-
ous Protestant denominations. As the
church could not always be at our dispo-
sal, my friends made arrangements that
I should use a hall in the Cooper Insti-
tute, and there continue the free and
open discussion of religious doctrine and
truth. I preached there during the eight
months from October, 1858, to May,
1859. The success of this enterprise
was somewhat remarkable. The hall,
though an ample one, was on several
occasions found to be too small for the
audience.
	My Sunday discourses might have
continued indefinitely, had I not received
in April of 1859 a letter from Mr. Long-
fellow, asking me to become an assistant
professor of the French language and
literature at Harvard University. As
this invitation came to me entirely un-
sought, and was accompanied by an ex-
pression of deep affection on the part of
Mr. Longfellow, I asked myself with no
little concern whether I should not ac-
cept it. The thought of putting down a
task so lately begun and so full of pro-
mise was distasteful to me, and I ac-
cepted Mr. Longfellows invitation only
with the determination that at some fu-
ture day I would resume religious wcrk.
	Many were the expressions of regret
by those who made up our little con-
gregation that the services were to be
discontinued. A generous effort was
made, started by Mr. Leavitt Hunt, to
establish the enterprise upon a perma-
nent basis; but as this came after my
letter of acceptance had been sent to Mr.
Longfellow, it could not accomplish its
purpose.
	Hardly had I begun my course of lec-
tures at the university when a proposi-
tion was made to me by Mr. Agassiz,
whose school in Cambridge will long be
remembered as the leading institution
in this country for the education of
young wonmen. Most of the instructors
were professors at the university. Mr.
Agassiz was preparing at this time to
make a journey of exploration in South
America, which would probably con-
sume many months, and he came to me
with the request that I should take his
lecture hours in the school for a course
in French literature. I at once accepted
this offer, and found myself happy in a
work so congenial to my training and
inclinations. But another proposition fol-
lowed this, which pleased me even more.
The Rev. Dr. Manning, pastor of the
Old South Church, a Congregationalist
of the liberal school, having heard of
the work I had been doing, called on
me and asked me to undertake a similar
work in Boston. He placed the Old
South Chapel at my disposal, and the
Sunday after the first of my services had
been announced in the papers I found
the chapel full. To take up religious
work again was most agreeable to me,
especially as I had not ceased to regret
my enforced separation from our little
band of enthusiasts in New York.
	My life at Cambridge renewed many
of the associations which I had found so
helpful and gratifying during my first
visit to Boston. Among others, it was
my privilege to come in contact with
that rare mind, Ralph Waldo Emerson.
I recall quite distinctly a day I spent
at his home in Concord. In the after-
noon he proposed a walk in a grove a
short distance from his home. In the
middle of this bit of woods was a some-
what spacious pond, which Mr. Emerson</PB>

looked upon as a lake. We sat down on
a little hill which commanded a view of
it.	After some moments of mute con-
templation Emerson said to me, It is
now fifteen years that every day when
the weather and my occupations permit
I come and sit for a few moments in this
place, and each time I find in this little
lake some new beauty.~~
	I made the acquaintance at this time
of two other men of eminence, James
Heeinan Clarke and Thomas Starr King.
The latter was to prove not only an
agreeable companion, bnt a warm-heart-
ed friend. In such an atmosphere,
among men of many views, I found am-
ple food for reflection and abundant op-
portunity for study in the line of both
religious and political thought.
	The death of Theodore Parker grieved
me immeasurably. I find in my journal
some expressions of my sorrow.

	May 11, 1860. He is dead. What
a loss! The nation will at last appre-
ciate him. Strange circumstance! the
very day they learn the sad news is the
one on which the Unitarians hold their
annual convention in the same hall where
each Sunday people have come in crowds
to hear him. It could not be said that
all the Unitarians who attended this
convention were in full sympathy with
Theodore Parker; notwithstanding, this
evening all prejudice seemed to have
vanished as if by enchantment. When
the news of his death became known,
each speaker in turn referred affection-
ately and reverently to the prophet who
had been taken from them, and each
time the public received his name with
the most heartfelt testimony of symnpa-
thy and regard. Indeed, all the inter-
est of the meeting turned to a manifes-
tation in favor of the reformer.

	The Unitarians seem to me to be the
most intelligent of Protestant ministers,
and in almost every instance snperior
men. Their liberalism is sincere; they
love and preach virtue for its own sake;
their discourses are less sermons than
lofty moral essays, in which the con-
science as well as the mind finds much
to stimulate and strengthen it. Of all
those who honored me with their friench
ship, there was not one for whom I did
not entertain a high and sincere regard;
but I must mention one especially, the
best nian, perhaps, whom I have had the
privilege of knowing,  the Rev. Dr.
Gannett. I remember that on oiie oc-
casion lie spoke iii words of the most
sincere admiration of M. de Cheverus,
the first Roman. bishop of Boston.
	Abandoned in a miserable cabin, not
far from Boston, was an infirm negro.
The bishop found him, andy without in-
forming any one, every evening, after
his days dnties, quietly made his way to
the cabin and devoted himself to this
afflicted creature; washing and dressing
his sores, making his bed, and providing
for his various wants. A servant, who
remarked that on the bishops return his
coat was covered with dust and feathers,
wondered where his master went, and
followed him afar off on one of his excur-
sions. Looking between the loose tim-
bers which made the wall of the cabin, he
saw the man of God engaged in his work
of mercy.
	Dr. Gannett told me this story with
admiration for such devotion on the part
of a prelate. Little did he suppose that
I myself would surprise him in the ex-
ercise of a no less humble and Christ-
like charity. I had been told that a
certain German teacher, Professor Sherb,
was lying ill in a cold and comfortless
attic in a miserable quarter of the city,
and had no one to take care of him.
At my first free moment I sought the
lodging of this poor man, but Dr. Gan-
nett was there before me. I found him
at the door with a broom in his hand,
with which he had been sweeping the
room of the invalid. I entered, and
saw the sick man sitting in front of
a newly lighted fire, carefully rolled up</PB>

in a blanket, eating grapes which had
been brought him by the good Samaritan.
The mattress had been removed from
the bed, the sheets had been hung out to
air, the meagre furnishings of the room
bad been put in order: and all this by
the hand of my excellent friend, who ap-
peared quite confused when caught in
the act.
	His embarrassment was not less when,
on another occasion, I discovered him in
one of the back streets of Boston carry-
ing a bowl of steaming broth into a mis-
erable-looking abode where no doubt
dwelt another of his charges.

	My life and work at Harvard Univer-
sity continued until the outbreak of the
rebellion. Naturally the college life
was affected by this serious trouble, and
many departments of the university
were virtually suspended. Among both
professors and students the most ardent
patriotism was manifested, and when the
call came for volunteers a large propor-
tion of our number were not slow to re-
spond. I remember a most affecting
scene which expressed the deep loyalty
of both North and South to what they
conceived to be right. When it became
evident that the country was upon the
verge of a supreme crisis and that war
was inevitable, a general meeting of the
students and professors was held before
separating to go to their several states.
Many of our men were Southerners,
and it was seen that at the call of duty
fellow student would be obliged to face
fellow student in the impending strug-
gle. This thought cast a very deep so-
lemnity over our meeting, and nothing
could have been more touching than to
see these men embrace one another with
the utmost affection on the eve of their
separation.
	The attitude of foreign countries to-
ward the North will be remembered as
doubtful. England was decidedly an-
tagonistic, while France seemed to be
uncertain. Her press was divided and
by no means positive in friendliness to~
ward the cause of the Union. It seemed
to me that I could be of service to my
adopted country by visiting Paris and
counseling with those in control of the
journals of the day, some of whom I
knew, with the object of winning their
support for the government. I commu-
nicated with the Rev. Dr. Bellows, pre-
sident of the Sanitary Commission, and
suggested the advisability of the step I
had in mind. He approved my project
most heartily, and after a conference
with the Secretary of State, Mr. Sew-
ard, commissioned me to carry out this
scheme. It was arranged that I should
start for Paris without delay, see in par-
ticular each of the prominent journal-
ists, preachers, and professors who exer-
cised any marked influence on public
opinion, and work in the best way to
win them to the cause of the Union.
	After seven years of absence I found
myself in Paris once more. My emo-
tions cannot be described, nor is it my
desire here to dwell upon the many re-
collections which came to me as I viewed
again places so familiar and formerly so
closely identified with my life. As soon
as possible I sought interviews with the
leading men of the liberal party: Jules
Simon, Eugene Pelletan, Pr~vost-Para-
dol of Le Journal des D6bats, Louis Jour-
dan of Le Si~cle, Elis~e Reclus of the
Revue des Deux Mondes, Fr6d~ric Mo-
rin, Edouard Fauvety, Yacherot, and
others,  all men of the highest standing
in the world of letters. Those who had
at first some doubt on the subject soon
became convinced that the war was not,
on the part of the North, a war for sov-
ereignty, but a war for deliverance;
that whatever might be the pretensions
of parties and the particular views of
many, slavery was the real cause of the
struggle, and its abolition must be the
ultimate result. And from that moment,
with a unity and perseverance quite re-
markable, all of these worthy men be-
came earnest defenders of the Union,</PB>

whether in public journal or in private
writing.
	I was especially anxious to meet M.
Edouard Laboulaye, for I knew him to
be more than all the others interested in
the conflict and in sympathy with this
country. As he was not then in Paris
I wrote to him at his country-seat. I
received in answer a letter asking me to
come to Bourg-la-Reine and spend a day
with him. Of course I took advantage
of this invitation, and passed seven of
the most agreeable hours of my life in
an uninterrupted conversation with M.
Laboulaye The chief and almost the
only subject of our talk was the Ameri-
can republic, her trials, her hopes, her
institutions. Great indeed was my sur-
prise to find a Frenchman who had never
crossed the Atlantic better acquainted
with the affairs of this country than many
Americans, more earnest about the main-
tenance of the Union than many of our
celebrated politicians, and appreciating
better our privileges and dangers than
many of our leaders.
	Of that conversation I shall relate only
the rather strange circumstance which
was the beginning of his acquaintance
with the great men and things of this
country. One day, as M. Laboulaye was
looking for some curiosity or lost trea-
sure on the shelves of a second - hand
bookseller of the Quai Voltaire, he by
chance opened a stray volume of ser-
mons by William Ellery Channing.
Sermons by an American preacher were
a novelty to him. The sum of five
cents secured the book, and while pur-
suing his course toward the Champs
Elys6es he began to read it. The more
he read, the more his wonder and inter-
est increased; so much so that he sat
down under a tree, and could not stop
until he had finished the volume. Hap-
py in this unlooked - for discovery, he
started to return to his house, when he
encountered his friend, Armand Bertin,
then the celebrated editor of the D&#38; 
bats. Congratulate me, said M. La-
boulaye. I have just put my hand
on a great man. Well, replied the
editor, one who meets with such good
fortune is indeed to be congratulated.
And who is your great man? Chan-
ning! Canning? exclaimed M. Ber-
tin. A fine discovery indeed! Every
one knows Cannino I dont mean
Canning, the Englishman; I mean Chan-
ning, an American preacher, and forth-
with M. Laboulayc asked the privilege
of writing for the D~bats his impressions
of Channing M. Bertin assented, and
three articles were successively published
on the Boston divine. Several articles
followed on other American celebrities,
and from that time this country and her
institutions became the favorite topic of
M. Laboulayes studies.
	All his discoveries he communicated
with true enthusiasm, first to the numer-
ous hearers of his lectures at the Coll~ge
de France, then to the public through
the journals or through his pamphlets,
which were always read with avidity; and
finally, on this same darling subject he
published two books, destined to remain
as monuments of his wonderful know-
ledge of and devotedness to this country,
namely, LHistoire Politique des Etats-
Unis, a standard work of the literature
of this age, and Paris en Am4rique, the
best, perhaps, of modern satires. Thus,
while he remained always devoutly at-
tached to France as a revered and cher-
ished mother, he seemed to have loved
Young America as a charming spouse.
	When I returned to the United States
the civil war was at its height. rI~he at-
tention of the whole country, North and
South, was centred in the nioinentous
struggle. Every other interest fell into
abeyance before the grave and critical
problem which the nation had been
called upon to solve Naturally, at such
a time, the thoughts of the people, es-
pecially in the East, were not given to
matters intellectual and educational.
While I was casting about in some con-
cern for an occupation, an unexpected</PB>

proposal came from my friend the Rev.
Thomas Starr King, then pastor of the
First Unitarian Church of San Fran-
cisco, and the leading preacher of the
Pacific coast. It was largely due to his
influence and eloquence that California
was secured to the Union. Mr. Kings
plan was that I should come to San Fran-
cisco and establish a school on the plan
of that of Mr. Agassiz in Cambridge.
An invitation to undertake such a work
was very congenial to me, and came most
opportunely; I was more~ than glad to
accept it.
	From the moment of my arrival at
San Francisco Mr. King threw himself
with all his heart into the project before
us. A fine location was chosen in a most
desirable quarter of the city, South Park,
and plans were prepared for a large and
handsome building. In the meantime the
parish house of the Unitarian Church
was placed at our disposal. Here on
February 1, 1864, our school was opened
by Mr. King himself. The prospects were
bright before us, and not the least in-
viting was the prospect of being in close
touch with a man of such excellent spirit.
From time to time we enjoyed most in-
teresting conversations together, always
on some religious, scientific, or political
subject. At one of these meetings, I
remember, we remained two hours in
the gallery of the new church, communi-
cating our views and sentiments in an
expansion full of charm. When we got
up to separate, taking both my hands in
his, he said: It is Wednesday; let it
be understood that for the future every
Wednesday, from two till four oclock,
we shall put aside for mutual edification
and conversation like that which we have
just enjoyed. Man proposes, God dis-
poses. The following Wednesday Mr.
King was lying upon his death-bed, and
the Wednesday after that the soul of this
man of God was in heaven.

	March 4,1864. What a date! What
a day! What a loss! The best of friends,
the most ardent of patriots, the most
generous of philanthropists, the good,
the noble Starr King is taken from us!
Could we have believed last week, when
he brought us a new testimony of his
precious interest, could we have thought
it was his last visit, his last going out,
the last occasion given us to hear his
most sympathetic voice, to look in life
upon his serene face! . . . All the city
is in consternation. Friends meet and
clasp hands with tearful eyes, but can-
not speak. They say more tears have
been shed to-day than during all the
citys life. More than a thousand flags
float at half-mast, on private dwellings
as well as on public buildings. 0 worthy
man, how deeply your people love you!
	Jifarch 5. The manifestation of to-
day in honor of the noble dead is not less
worthy than that of yesterday. The re.
mains are lying in state in the church
which has just been completed, and seems
now as if built to be his monument. A
company of the first regiment of militia
and the Free Masons act as a guard of
honor. From noon until ten oclock at
night a long file of people continued to
pass by and to gaze for the last time on
the inanimate features of him who but a
few days before electrified the multitude.

	The following Sunday, not only the
congregation, but many strangers assem-
bled in the church at the usual hour.
The pastors gown was laid upon the pul-
pit. Not a word was said. Not a note
was sung; only from time to time the
organ was played softly, while the peo-
ple sat in mute contemplation, giving their
thoughts and their hearts to the noble
life which had so suddenly been taken
from them. The first regular service
was held a week later, in memory of
this holy man. The high privilege was
mine, on that occasion, to voice the feel-
ings of the people and to express their
last tribute to the dead.

	THE Comtesse Chantavoine, 
young, rich, amiable. You shall meet
her to-morrow. Long after Philip left
the duke to go to his own chamber these
words rang in his ears. He felt the cords
of fate tightening round him. So real
was the momentary illusion of being
bound that, as he passed through the
great hail where hung the pictures of
his hosts ancestors, he made a sudden
outward motion of his arms as though
to free himself from a physical restraint.

riage in the designs of the duke. He
had forgotten that sovereign dukes must

first impulse had been to declare that to
introduce him to the countess would be
futile, for he was already married. But
the instant warning of the mind that his
highness could never and would never
accept the daughter of a Jersey ship-
builder restrained him. He had no idea
that Guidas descent from the de Man-
prats of Chamb~ry would weigh with the
duke, who would only see in her some
apple - cheeked peasant stumbling over
her court train.
	So Philip held his peace, as he had
held it upon this matter ever since he
came to Bercy. It was not his way
to be rash, though it was his way to
be bold. There would he boldness in
another direction,  in withholding the
knowledge of his marriage. It was cu-
rious that the duke had never even hint-
ed at the chance of his being already
married; yet not so curious, either, since
complete silence concerning a wife was
declaration enough that he was unmar-
ried. He felt in his heart that a finer
sense would have offered Guida no such
humiliating affront, for he knew the lie
of silence was as evil as the lie of speech.
	He had not spoken, partly because he
had not yet become used to the fact
that he really was married. It had
never been brought home to him by the
ever present conviction of habit~ One
day of married life, or, in reality, a few
hours of married life with Guida had

tender enthusiasm of mind and memory

homeward way, he has no money to buy
another, and he is tried and convicted
on a charge of theft. Thus the custom
of society establishes the charge of im-
morality upon the technical defect. But
not on that alone; upon the principle
that what is committed in trust shall be
held inviolate with an exact obedience to
conditions and an adherence to the spirit
as to the letter of the law.
	But the issue did not come squarely
to Philip. He had not openly lied about
Guida; as yet he had no intention of
doing so. He even figured to himself
with what surprise Quida would greet
his announcement that she was hence-
forth Princesse Guida dAvranche, and
in due time would be her serene high-
ness the Duchess~ de Bercy. Certainly
there was nothing immoral in his ambi-
tions. If the present serene highness
chose to establish him as second in suc-
cession to the reigning prince, who had
a right to complain?
	Then, as to an officer of the English
navy accepting succession in a sovereign
duchy in suzerainty to the present gov-
ernment of France, while England was
at war with her,  his host had more
than once, in almost so many words,
defined the situation. Because the duke
himself, with no successor assured, was
powerless to take sides with the Roy-
alists against the Revolutionary govern-
ment, he was at the moment obliged,
for the very existence of his duchy, to
hoist the tricolor upon the castle with
his own flag. Once the succession was
assured beyond the imbecile Leopold
John, then he would certainly declare
against the present fiendish government,
and for the overthrown dynasty.
	Now, England was fighting France
not only because she was revolutionary
France, but because of the murder of
Louis XVI. and for the restoration of
that overthrown dynasty. Also she was
in close sympathy with the war of the
Vend~e, to which she would lend all
possible assistance. Philip argued that
if it was his duty, as a captain in the
English navy, to fight against revolu-
tionary France from without, he would
be beyond criticism if, as the Duc de
Bercy, he also fought against her from
within.
	Indeed, it was with this statement of
the facts that the second military officer
of the duchy had some days before been
dispatched to the Court of St. James
to secure its intervention for Philips
release, by an important exchange of
prisoners with the French government.
This officer was also charged with se-
curing the consent of the English King
for Philips acceptance of the succession
in the duchy while retaining his posi-
tion in the English navy. The envoy
had been instructed by the duke to offer
his sympathy with England in the war
and his secret adherence to the Royalist
cause, to become open as soon as the
succession through Philip was secured.
	To Philips mind all that side of the
case was in his favor, and sorted well
with his principles of professional honor.
Then came up the question of his pri-
vate honor. He conceived it to be a
reckless sacrifice of possibilities to tell
the duke of his marriage. He was en-
gaged in a game of chances, and what
might happen would all be the fortune
of the dice. To tell of his marriage
was to load the dice against himself;
not to do so was to put his private
honor in the hazard. In his momentous
translation from a prison to a palace,
with dazzling fortunes in view, there
came upon him confusion of the judg-
ment and of the moralities; he felt that
the opportunity for speaking of the mar-
riage had passed.
	He seated himself at a table, and took
from his pocket a letter of Guidas, writ-
ten many weeks before, in which she
said with an unmistakable firmness that
she had not announced the marriage and
would not; that he must do it, and he
alone; that the letter written to her
grandfather had not been received by</PB>

him, and that no one in Jersey knew
their secret.
	In reading this letter again a wave of
feeling rushed over him. He realized the
force and strength of her nature; every
word had a clear and sharp straightfor-
wardness and the ring of truth. She
was not twenty, yet how powerful and
clear was her intelligence! A gifted
creature, an unusual mind, the Cheva-
lier du Champsavoys had once said of
her in Philips hearing. That was it:
a	gifted creature with an unusual mind.
All at once he had been brought to
understand that a crisis was near, and
he straightway prepared to meet it.
The duke had said that he must marry;
a woman had already been chosen for
him, and he was to meet her to-morrow.
But that meant nothing; to meet a wo-
man was not of necessity to marry her.
There were a thousand chances against
the woman liking him; and what could
she be to him, this Comtesse Chanta-
voine? Yet it might be necessary to
give in his apparent adherence to this
comedy devised by the duke, certainly
until after the adoption and succession
were formally arranged. Then why,
by that time he would be released, he
would have to present himself in Eng-
land to receive a new command, and
delays, where a woman is concerned, are
easy. Even supposing matters became
critical, the countess herself might be in
no hurry to marry.
	Marry! He could feel his flesh creep-
ing. It gave him an ugly, startled sen-
sation. It was like some imp of Satan
to drop into his ear now the suggestion
that princes, ere this, had been known
to have two wives, one of them unoffi-
cial. Yet he could have struck himself
in the face for the iniquity of the sug-
gestion; he flushed from the indecency
of it,  and so have sinners ever flushed
as they set forth on the garish road to
Avernus.
	Yexed with these unbidden and un-
welcome thoughts, he got up and walked
about his chamber restlessly. Guida,
 the poor Guida! he said to himself
manytimes. He was angry, disgusted, that
those shameful, irresponsible thoughts
should have come to him. He would
atone for all that, and more, when he was
Prince and she Princesse dAvranche.
But nevertheless he was ill at ease with
himself. Guida was off there alone in
Jersey,  alone.
	Suddenly there flashed into his mind
another possibility. Suppose  why,
suppose  thoughtless scoundrel that he
had been!  suppose that there might
come another than himself and Guida
to bear his name! And Guida was
there alone, and her marriage still kept
secret,  the danger of it to her good
name! But she had said nothing in
her letters, hinted nothing. No, in none
had there been the most distant sugges-
tion. Then and there he got the letters,
one and all, and read them, every word,
every line, all through to the end. No,
there was not one hint. Of course it
could not be so; she would have  but
no, she might not have  Guida was
unlike anybody else.
	He read on and on. And now, some-
how, he thought he caught in one of
the letters a new ring, a pensive grav-
ity, a deeper tension, which were like
ciphers or signals to tell him of some
change in her. For a moment he was
shaken. Manhood, human sympathy,
surged up in him. The first flush of a
new sensation ran through his veins like
fire. The first instinct of fatherhood
came to him,  a thrilling, uplifting feel-
ing. But as suddenly there shot through
his mind a thought which brought him
to his feet with a spring.
	Why, suppose  suppose that it was
so! Suppose that through Guida the
further succession might presently be
made sure, and suppose he went to the
prince and told him all,  that might
achieve his consent in her favor; and the
rest would be easy. That was it, as clear
as day. Meanwhile he would hold his</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00087" SEQ="0087" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="81">	The Battle of the Strong.	81

peace. He would take his part in the
perilous comedy; he would meet the
countess, but he would force her to re-
gard him with commonplace feelings;
he would pay no real court to her; he
would wait  and wait.
	For above all else,  and this was the
thing that clinched the purpose in his
mind,  above all else, the duke at best
had but a brief time to live. He saw it
himself, and but a week ago the court
physician had told Philip that only un-
usual excitement kept the duke alive;
that any violence or shock, physical or
mental, might snap the thread of exist-
ence. Plainly, the thing was to go on
as he had been going,  to keep his
marriage secret, meet the countess, up-
parently accede to all the duke suggest-
ed, and wait  wait!
	With this definite purpose in his mind
coloring all that he might say, yet crip-
pling the freedom of his thought, he sat
down and wrote to Guida. Tie had not
written to her, according to the condi-
tion made by M. Dalbarade that during
his stay at the castle he should hold coum-
munication with no one outside upon any
consideration whatsoever. He was on
parole: this issue was clear; he could
not send a letter to Guida until he was
freed from the condition agreed to by
the duke for him. It had been a bitter
pill to swallow; and he had had to strug-
gle with himself many times since his
arrival at the castle. For whatever the
new ambitions and undertakings, there
was still in the mysterious and lonely
distance a woman for whose welfare he
was responsible, for whose happiness he
had yet done nothing, unless to give her
his name under sombre conditions was
happiness for her. Since his marriage,
all that he had done to remind him of
the new life which he had so hurriedly,
so daringly, so eloquently entered upon
was to send his young wife fifty pounds.
Somehow, as this fact flashed to his re-
membrance now, it made him shrink;
it had a certain cold, commercial look
	VOL. LXXXII.  No. 489.	6
which struck him unpleasantly. Perhaps,
indeed, the singular and painful shyness
 chill almost  with which Guida had
received those fifty pounds now comnmu-
nicated itself to him by the intangible
telegraphy of the mind and spirit.
	All at once, that bare, glacial fact of
having sent her fifty pounds acted as a
cynical illumination of his real position.
He felt conscious now that Guida would
have preferred some simple gift, some
little thing that women love, in token and
remembrance, rather than the common-
place if necessary token of the ordinary
duties of life. Now that he came to
thiuik of it, since he had left her in Jer-
sey, he had never sent her ever so small
a gift. Indeed, he had never given her
any gifts at all save the Maltese cross
in her childhood and her wedding-ring.
As for the ring, it had never occurred
to him that she could not wear it except
in the stillness of the night, unseen by
any eye but her own. He did not know
that she had been wont to go to sleep
with the hand clasped to her breast,
pressing close to her the one outward
token she had of a new life, begun with
a sweetness which was very bitter, and a
bitterness which was only a little sweet.
	Philip was in no fitting mood to write
a letter. Too many emotions were in
conflict in him at once. They were hav-
ing their way with him; and perhaps
in this very complexity of his feelings he
came nearer to being really and acutely
himself than he had ever been in his life.
Indeed, there was a moment when he
was almost ready to consign the duke
and all that appertained to him to the
devil or the deep sea, and to take his
fate as it came. But one of the other
selves of him called down from the little
attic where dark things brood, and told
him that to throw up his present chances
would bring him no nearer and rio soon-
er to Guida, and must return him to the
prison whence he came.
	No, he must go on,  that was the
only thing to do. Now, however, he</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00088" SEQ="0088" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="82">	82	The Battle of the Strong.

would write to Guida, and send the let-
ter when he was released from parole.
But how many times did he tear up the
paper in vain attempt to speak to her
out of the confusion of his thoughts! At
last, like a hunter who, having lost his
compass and his bearings, makes a dash
through the wood in the hold belief that
safety lies beyond if he but drive ahead,
heedless, strong, enduring, so he plunged
into the letter which told his wife where
he was, of his opportunities, and of the
brilliant outlook for them both.
	His courage grew as the sentences
spread out before him; he became elo-
quent. He told her how heavily the
days and months went on apart from
her. He emptied out the sensations of
absence, loneliness, desire, and affection.
He wondered how she fared,  won-
dered tenderly. All at once he stopped
short. It flashed upon him now that al-
ways his letters had been entirely of his
own doings; he had pictured himself al-
ways,  his own loneliness, his own grief
at separation. He had never yet spoken
of the details of her life, questioned her
of this and of that, of all those things
which fill the life of a woman,  not
because she loves the little things, but
because she is a woman, and the know-
ledge and governance of these little things
are the habit and the duty of her life.
His past egotism was borne in upon him
now. He would try to atone for it. He
asked her many questions; but one he
did not ask, dared not ask, did not know
how to speak to her of it. The fact that
be could not say what most he wished to
say was a powerful indictment of his re-
lations to her, of his treatment of her,
of his headlong courtship and marriage.
	So portions of this letter of his had
not the perfect ring of truth, had not
the conviction which unselfish and solici-
tous love alone can beget. It was only
at the last, only when he came to close
the letter, that his words went from him
with the sharp photography of his own
heart. It came, perhaps, from a remorse
which for the instant foreshadowed dan-
ger ahead; from an acute pity for her;
and maybe from a longing to forego the
attempt to don the promised pageantry
of an exalted place, and get back to the
straightforward hours, such as those upon
the Ecr6hos, when he knew that he loved
her. But the sharpness of his feelings
rendered more intense now the declara-
tion of his love. The phrases were wrung
from him. His hand trembled so that
his will must rule it to steadiness, and
that enforced pressure seemed to etch
the words into the paper. Good-by,
no, i~ la bonne henre, my dearest, he
wrote; good days are coming, brave,
great days, when I shall be free to
strike another blow for England, both
from within and from without France;
when I shall be, if all go well, the Prince
dAvranche, Dnc de Bercy, and you my
perfect princess. Good-by! Ton Philip,
qui taime toujours.
	He had hardly written the last words
when a servant knocked at his door.
	His serene highness offers his com-
pliments to monsieur, and will monsieur
descend to meet the Marquis Grandjon-
Larisse and the Comtesse Chantavoine,
who have just arrived.
	For an instant Philip could scarce
control his feelings to quietness, but he
sent a message of obedience, and pre-
pared to go down.
	So it had come,  not to-morrow, but
to-day. Already the deep game was on.
With a sigh which was half of bitter and
mocking laughter, he seized the sand-
box, dried the letter to Gnida, and put
it in his pocket. As he descended the
staircase, the last words of it kept as-
sailing his mind, singing in his brain:
Ton Philip, qui taime toujours!


XXII.

	Not many evenings after Philips first
interview with the ~omtesse Chanta-
voine, a visitor arrived at the ca~tle~</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00089" SEQ="0089" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="83">The Battle of the Strony.

From his roundabout approach up the
steep cliff in the dusk it was clear he
wished to avoid observation. Of gab
lant bearing, he was attired in a fashion
unlike the citizens of Bercy or the Re-
publican military, who were often to be
seen in the streets of the town. The
whole relief of the costume was white,
 white sash, white cuffs turned back,
white collar, white rosette and band,
white and red bandeau, and the faint
glitter of a white shirt; in contrast were
the black hat and plume, black tie,
black top - boots with huge spurs, and
yellow breeches. He carried a gun and
a sword, and a pistol was stuck in the
white sash. But one thing arrested the
eye more than all else: a white square
on the breast of the long brown coat,
strangely ornamented with a red heart
and cross. He was evidently a soldier
of distinguished rank, but not of the
army of the Republic.
	The face was that of a devotee, not
of peace, but of war, of some forlorn cru-
sade. It had deep enthusiasm, which
yet to the trained observer would have
seemed rather the tireless faith of a con-
vert than the disposition of the natural
man. It was somewhat heavily lined
for one so young. The marks of a hard
life were on him; but distinction and
energy were in his look and in every
turn of his body.
	Arriving at the castle, he knocked at
the postern. At first sight of him the
porter suspiciously blocked the entrance
with his person, but seeing the badge
upon his breast stood at gaze, and a look
of keen curiosity crossed his face. On
the visitor announcing that he was of the
house of Yanfontaine, this curiosity was
mingled with as keen surprise; he was
admitted with every mark of respect, and
the gates closed behind him.
	Has his highness any visitors? he
asked as he dismounted.
	The porter nodded assent.
	Who are they? He slipped a coin
into the porters hand.
	One of the family, a cousin, his
serene highness calls him.
	Hm, indeed! A Vaufontaine,
friend?
	No, monseigneur, a dAvranche.
	What dAvranche? Not the Prince
Leopold John?
	No, monseigneur; the name is the
same as his highnesss.
	Philip dAvranehe ~ Hm! from
whence?
	From Paris, monseigneur, with his
highness.
	The visitor, whistling softly, stood
thinking a moment. Presently he add-
ed, How old is he?
	About the same age as monsei-
gneur.
	How does he occupy himself?
	He walks, rides, talks with his high-
ness, asks questions of the people, reads
in the library, and sometimes shoots and
fishes.
	Is he a soldier?
	He carries no sword, and he takes
a long aim with his gun!
	There was a sly smile lurking about
the porters mouth. The visitor drew
from his pocket a second gold piece, and,
slipping it into the others hand, said,
Tell it all at once. Who is the gen-
tleman, and what is his business here?
Is he, perhaps, on the side of the Revo-
lution, or does lie keep better company?
	He looked keenly into the eyes of the
porter, who screwed up his own, return-
ing the gaze unflinchingly. Handing
back the gold piece, the man answered
firmly, I have told monseigneur what
every one in the duchy knows; there s
no charge for that. For what more his
highness and  and those that his high-
ness trusts know  he drew himself up
with brusque importance  there s no
price, monseigneur.
	Body o me, here s pride and vain-
glory! returned the other. I know
you, my fine Pergot. I knew you almost
too well years ago, and then you were
not so sensitive; then you were a good</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00090" SEQ="0090" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="84">	84	The Battle of the Strong.
Royalist like me, Pergot. This time
he fastened the mans look with his own,
and held it until Pergot dropped his head
before it.
	I dont remember monseigneur, he
said, perturbed.
	Of course not. The fine Pergot has
a bad memory, like a good Republican,
who by law cannot worship his God, or
ask the priest to visit him when he s
dying, or make the sign of the cross; a
red Revolutionist is our Pergot now!
I m as good a Royalist as monsel-
gneur, retorted the man, with some as-
perity. So are most of us. Only 
only his highness says to us 
Dont gossip of what his highness
says, but do his bidding, Pergot. What
a fool you are to babble thus! How
d ye know but I m one of Fouch6s or
Bar~res men? How d ye know but
there are five hundred men outside wait-
ing for my whistle?
	The man changed instantly. His
hand was at his side like lightning.
They d never hear that whistle, mon-
seigneur, though you be Vaufontaine or
no Vaufontaine!
	His eyes were fixed on the visitors
with stubborn determination. The other,
smiling, reached out and touched him
on the shoulder kindly.
	My dear Frange Pergot, said he,
that s the man I knew once, and the
sort of man that s been fighting with me
for the Church and for the King these
months past in the Vend6e. Come,
come, dont you know me, Pergot?
Dont you remember the scapegrace with
whom, for a jape, you waylaid my uncle
the cardinal and robbed him, and then
gave him back his jeweled watch in re-
turn for a years indulgences?
	But no, no, answered the man,
crossing himself quickly, and by the dim
lanthorn light peering into the visitors
face, it is not possible, monseigneur.
The Comte D4tricand de Tournay died
in the Jersey Isle with him they called
IRullecour.
	Well, well, you might at least re-
member this, rejoined the other, show-
ing a scar in the palm of his hand.
	Recognition was instant now, and an
old friendship was cemented anew. A
little later there was ushered into the
library of the castle the Comte D6tricand
de Tournay, who, under the name of
Savary dit D6tricand, had lived in the
Isle of Jersey for many years. There
he had been a dissipated idler, a keeper
of worthless company, an alien coolly ac-
cepting the hospitality of a country he
had ruthlessly invaded as a boy. Now,
returned from vagabondage, he was the
valiant and honored heir of the house of
Vaufontaine, and the heir presumptive
of the house of Bercy.
	True to his intention, D6tricand had
joined La Rochejaquelein, the intrepid,
inspired leader of the Vend6e, whose
sentiments became his own: If I ad-
vance, follow me; if I retreat, kill me;
if I fall, avenge me. He had proven
himself daring, courageous, and re-
sourceful. His immovable gayety of
spirits infected the simple peasants with
a rebounding energy; his fearlessness
inspired their confidence; his kindness
to the wounded, friend or foe, his mercy
to prisoners, the gentle respect he showed
the devoted priests who shared with the
peasants the perils of war, had already
made him beloved. He had also often
helped to reconcile divisions, and to har-
monize the varying views of the chief-
tains of the Vendee.
	From the first all the leaders trusted
him, and he sprang in a day, as had
done the peasants Cathelineau, dIElb6e,
and Stofflet, gentlemen like Lescure and
Bonchamp, and noble fighters like dAn-
tichamp and the Prince of Talmont, to
an outstanding position in the Royal-
ist army. Again and again he had been
engaged in perilous sorties and had led
forlorn hopes. He had now come from
the splendid victory at Saumur to urge
his own kinsman, the Prince dAvranche,
Due de Bercy, to join the Royalists.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00091" SEQ="0091" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="85">	The Battle of the Strong.	85

	It was the heyday of the cause. The
taking of Saumur and the destruction of
Coustards army, together with the cap-
ture of eleven thousand prisoners, were
powerful arguments to lay before a no-
bleman all the traditions of whose house
were of constant alliance with the Crown
of France, whose very duchy had been
the gift of a French monarch. D6tri-
cand bad not seen the duke since he was
a lad at Versailles, and there would be
much in his favor; for some winning
power in him had of late grown deep
and penetrating, and of all the Vaufon-
tames the duke had reason to dislike him
least.
	When the duke entered to D~tricand
in the library, he was under the influence
of the convincing letter from the monks
who had been engaged upon the pedi-
gree of Commander Philip dAvranche,
and of a stimulating talk with the young
English Norman himself. With the
memory of past feuds and hatreds in his
mind, and predisposed against any Yau-
fontaine, his greeting was cold and cour-
teously disdainful, his manner preoccu-
pied.
	Remarking that he had but lately heard
of Monsieur le Comtes return to France,
he hoped he had enjoyed his career
in  was it in England or in America?
But yes, he remembered: it began with
an expedition to take the Channel Isles
from England,  an insolent, a criminal
business in time of peace, fit only for
boys or filibusters. Had Monsieur he
Comte then spent all these years in the
Channel Isles,  a prisoner, possibly?
No? Fastening his eyes cynically on the
symbol of the Royalist cause on D6tri-
cands breast, he asked to what he was
indebted for the honor of this present
visit. Perhaps, he added dryly, it was
to inquire after his own health, which,
he was glad to assure Monsieur le Comte
and all his cousins of Vaufontaine, was
never better.
	His face was like a leather mask, tell-
ing nothing of the arid sarcasm in his
voice. The hands were shriveled, the
shoulders shrunken, the temples fallen
in; the neck behind was pinched, and the
eyes looked out like brown beads, alive
with fire and touched with the excite-
ment of monomania. His last words
had a delicate savagery of irony, though,
too, there could be heard in the tone a
defiance arguing apprehension, not lost
upon his visitor.
	D~tricand had smiled inwardly many
times during the old mans monologue,
which was broken only by courteous,
half-articulate interjections on his own
part. He knew too well the old feud
between their houses, the ambition that
had possessed many a Vaufontaine to
inherit the dukedom of Bercy, and the
dukes futile revolt against that possi-
bility; but for himself, heir to the prin-
cipality of Vaufontaine, and therefrom,
by succession, to that of Bercy, it had
no importance.
	He had but one passion now, and it
burned clear and strong; it dominated,
it possessed him. He would have given
up any worldly honor to see it succeed.
He had idled and misspent too many
years, had been vaurien and neer-do-
well too long, to be sordid now. Even
as the grievous sinner, come from dark
ways, turns with furious and tireless
strength to piety and good works, so
this vagabond of noble family, wheeling
suddenly in his tracks, had thrown him-
self into a cause which was all sacrifice,
courage, and unselfish patriotism,  a
holy warfare. The last bitter thrust of
the duke had touched no raw flesh; his
withers were unwrung. Gifted to thrust
in return, and with warrant to do so, lie
put aside the temptation, and with the
directness of one convinced of the right-
eousness of his cause, and with neither
time nor temper for diplomacy in crisis,
he answered his kinsman with daylight
clearness.
	Monsieur he Duc, said he, I am
glad your health is good; the better it
is, the better it suits the purpose of this</PB>

interview. I am come on business, and
on that alone. I am from Saumur,
where I Left La Rochejaquelein, Stofflet,
Cathelineau, and Lescure masters of the
city and victors over the Republican
army 
I have heard a rumor, interjected
the duke impatiently.
	I will give you fact, continued D6-
tricand, and he told of the series of suc-
cesses lately come to the army of the
Vend6e.
	And how does all this concern me,
Monsieur le Comte?  asked the duke.
	I am come to ask you to join us, 
to declare for our cause, for the Church
and for the King. Yours is of the no-
blest names in France. Will you not
stand openly for what you cannot waver
from in your heart? If the Duc de
Bercy declares for us, others will come
out of exile, and from submission to the
rebel government, to our aid. My mis-
sion from our leaders is to ask you to put
aside whatever reasons you have had for
alliance with this savage government, and
to proclaim for the King.
	The duke did not take his eyes from
D6tricands as he spoke. What was go-
ing on behind that parchment face who
might say?
	Are you aware, he said at last,
that I could send you straight from
here to the guillotine?
	So could the porter at your gates,
but he loves France almost as well as
does the Due de Bercy.
	You take refuge in the fact that you
are my kinsman.
	The honor is stimulating, but I
should not seek salvation by it. I have
the greater safety of being your guest,
answered D6tricand, with dignity.
	Too premature a sanctuary for a
Vaufontaine! retorted the duke, fight-
ing down growing admiration for a kins-
man whose family he would gladly root
out if it lay in his power.
	iDetricand made a gesture of impa-
tience, for he felt that his appeal had
availed nothing, and he had no heart for
a battle of words. His wit had been
tempered in many fires, his nature was
non-incandescent to praise or gibe. He
had had his share of pastime; now had
come his share of toil, and the mood for
give and take of words was not on him,
though to advance his cause he would
still use it in time of need.
	He went straight to the point now.
Hopelessly he spoke the plain truth.
	I want nothing of the Prince
dAvranche but his weight and power in
a cause for which the best gentlemen of
France are giving their lives. I fasten
my eyes on France alone; I fight for the
throne of Louis,  an altar of sacrifice
now by the martyred blood of the King,
	not for the duchy of Bercy. The
duchy of Bercy may sink or swim, for
all of me, if so be it does not stand with
us in our holy war.
	The duke interjected a disdainful
laugh.
	Suddenly there shot into D6tricands
mind a suggestion, which, wild as it was,
might after all helong to the grotesque
realities of life. So he added with mea-
sured deliberation, If alliance must
still be preserved with this evil govern-
ment of France, then be sure there is no
Vaufontaine who would care to inherit
a principality so discredited. To meet
that peril in succession the Due de Bercy
will do well to consult his new kinsman,
Philip dAvranche.
	For an instant there was absolute si-
lence in the room. The old noblemans
look was like a flash of flame in a mask
of dead flesh. The short upper lip was
arrested in a sort of snarl; the fingers,
half closed, were hooked like talons;
and the whole man was a picture of sur-
prise, fury, and injured pride. The
Due de Bercy to be harangued to his
duty, scathed, measured, disapproved,
and counseled by a striphing Vaufontaine.
	it was monstrous!
	It was the bitterness of aloes, also, for
in his own heart he knew that D6tricand</PB>

had spoken the truth. The fearless am
peal had roused him, for the moment at
least, to the beauty and righteousness of
a sombre, maybe hopeless cause, while
the impeachment had pierced every sore
in his heart. He felt the smarting anger
and outraged vanity of the wrong-doer
who, having argued down his own con-
science, and believing he has blinded oth-
ers as himself, suddenly finds that he
and his motives are naked before the
world.
	D6tricand had known regretfully, even
as he spoke, that the duke, no matter
what the reason, would not now join the
Royalist army; though, had his life been
in danger, he still would have spoken the
truth. So he had been human enough to
try to pry open the door of mystery by
a biting suggestion, for he had a feeling
that in the presence of the mysterious
kinsman Philip dAvranche lay the cause
of the resistance to his appeaL Who
was this Philip dAvranche? It seemed
absurd to D6tricand that his mind should
travel hack just then to the island of
Jersey.
	The dumb fury of his host was about
to break forth into speech, when the door
of the library opened and Philip stepped
inside. The silence holding two men now
held three, and a cold astonishment pos-
sessed the two younger. The duke was
too blind with anger to see the start of
recognition his visitors gave at sight of
each other, and by a curious concurrence
of feeling both D6tricand and Philip
avoided an acknowledgment of acquaint-
ance. Wariness was Philips cue, cau-
tious wonder D6tricands attitude.
	The duke spoke first. Turning from
Philip, he said to D6tricand, with mali-
cious triumph, It will disconcert Mon-
sieur le Comtes pious mind to know I
have yet one kinsman who finds it no
dishonor to inherit the duchy of Bercy.
Monsieur le Comte, permit me to intro-
duce Commander Philip dAvranche.
	Something of D6tricands old self
came back to him. His face flushed
with a sudden desire to laugh; then it
grew pale with a kind of dumb aston-
isliment. So this man was to be set
against him even in the heritage of his
family, as for one hour, in a kitchen in
Jersey, they had been bitter opposites
and secret rivals. He cared little about
the heritage of the houses of Vaufon-
tame and Bercy,  he had higher anibi-
tions; but this adventuring sailor roused
in him again the private grudge he had
once begged Philip to remember. Re-
covering himself, he said meaningly,
bowing low, The honor is memorable
 and monstrous!
	Philip set his teeth, but replied, I am
overwhelmed to meet one whose reputa-
tion is known  in every tap-room!
	Neither had chance to say more, for
the duke, though not understanding the
cause or meaning of the biting words, felt
the contempt and suggestion in D6tri-
cands voice, and burst out in anger,
Go tell the Prince of Vaufontaine that
the succession is assured to my house.
Monsieur, my cousin, Commander Phil-
ip dAvranche, is now my adopted son;
a wife is already chosen for him, and
soon, Monsieur le Cointe, there will be
still another successor to the title
	The Duc de Bercy should add in-
spired domestic prophecy to the family
record in the Almanach de Gotha! re-
turned D&#38; ricand, with a cold smile.
	Gods death! cried the old noble-
man, trembling with rage, and stretch-
ing toward the bell-rope. You shall
go to Paris and the Temple. Fouch6
will take good care of you!
	Stop, Monsieur le Duc!  D6tri-
cands voice rang through the room.
You shall not betray even the hum-
blest of your kinsmen, like that monster
dOrl6ans who betrayed the highest of
his. What is more, there are hundreds
of your people who still will pass a Roy-
alist on to safety.
	The dukes hand dropped from the
bell-rope. He knew that D~tricands
words were true. Ruling himself to</PB>

quiet, he said, with cold hatred, Like
all your breed, crafty and insolent! But
I will make you pay for it one day.
	Glancing toward Philip as though to
see if this would move him, D6tricand
answered, Make no haste on my behalf;
years are not of such moment to me as
to your highness.
	Philip saw D6tricands look, and felt
his moment and his chance had come.
Monsieur le Comte! he exclaimed
threateningly.
	The duke turned proudly to Philip.
You will collect the debt, cousin, said
he, and the smile on his face was wicked
as he again turned toward D&#38; ricnnd.
	With interest well compounded, re-
plied Philip firmly.
	D6tricand smiled. I have drawn the
Norman-Jersey cousin, then! said he.
Now we can proceed to compliments.
Then, with a change of manner, he
added quietly, Your highness, may the
house of Bercy have no worse enemy
than I! I came only to plead the cause
which, if it give death, gives honor too.
And I know well that at least you are
not against us. Monsieur dAvranche,
 he turned to Philip, and his words
were slow and deliberate,  I hope
we may yet meet in the Place du Vier
Prison,  but when and where you will,
and you shall find me in the Yend6e
when you please. So saying, he bowed,
and turned and left the room.
	What meant the fellow by the Place
du Vier Prison? asked the duke.
	Who knows, Monsieur le Duc?
answered Philip.
	A fanatic like all the Vaufontaines,
 a roisterer yesterday, a sainted che-
valier to-morrow! said the duke irrita-
bly. But they still have strength and
beauty  always!  he added reluctant
ly. Then he looked at the strong and
comely frame before him, and was reas-
sured. He laid a hand on Philips broad
shoulder admiringly. You will of course
have your hour with him, cousin; but not,
not till you are a dAvranche of Bercy.
	Not till I am a dAvranche of Ber-
cy, responded Philip in a low voice.


XXIII.

	With what seemed an unnecessary
boldness, D6tricand slept that night at
the inn, the Golden Crown, in the town
of Bercy; a Royalist of the Yend6e ex-
posing himself to deadly peril in a town
sworn to alliance with the Revolutionary
government. He knew that the town,
that the inn, might be full of spies, but
one other thing he also knew: the inn-
keeper of the Golden Crown would not
betray him, unless he had greatly changed
since fifteen years ago. Then they had
been friends, for his uncle of Vaufontaine
had had a small estate in Bercy itself, in
malicious proximity to the castle.
	He walked boldly into the inn parlor.
There were but three men in the room,
 the landlord, a stout burgher, and
Frange Pergot, the porter of the castle,
who had lost no time in carrying his
news; not that he might betray his old
comrade in escapade, but that he might
tell a chosen few, who were Royalists
under the rose, that he had seen one of
those servants of God, an officer of the
Yend~e.
	At sight of the white badge with the
red cross on D6tricands coat, the three
stood up and answered his greeting with
devout respect; and he had a speedy
reassurance that in this inn he was safe
from betrayal. Presently he learned that
three days hence a meeting of the states
of Bercy was to be held for setting the
seal upon the dukes formal adoption of
Philip dAvranche, and to execute a
deed of succession. These things were
to be done, that is, if the officer sent to
the English King should have returned
with Philips freedom and King Georges
license to accept the succession in the
duchy. From curiosity in these mat-
ters alone D6tricand would not have re-
mained at Bercy, but lie might use the</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00095" SEQ="0095" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="89">	The Battle of the Strong.	89

occasion for secretly gaining the adher-
ence of officers of the duchy to the cause
of the Royalists,  no hard task.
	During these three days of waiting
he heard with astonishment and concern
the rumor that the great meeting of
the states would be marked by Philips
betrothal to the Comtesse Chantavoine.
He cared little about the succession; he
had the consuming passion for a cause,
but there was ever with him the remem-
brance of Guida Landresse de Landresse,
and what touched Philip dAvranche he
associated with her. Of the true rela-
tions between Guida and Philip he knew
nothing, but from that last day in Jer-
sey he did know that Philip had roused
in her emotions perhaps less vital than
love, but assuredly less equable than
friendship.
	In his fear that Guida might suffer,
the more he thought of the Comtesse
Chantavoine as the chosen wife of Phil-
ip, the more it troubled him. For his
own part, he would have gone far and
done much to shield Guida from injury
or insult. He had seen and appreciat-
ed in her something higher than Philip
might understand,  a simple womanli-
ness, a fine hereditary nobleness, a pro-
found depth of character. Some day, if
he lived and his cause prospered, he
would go back to Jersey,  too late, per-
haps, to hope for anything from her, but
not too late to tell her his promise had
been kept, and to pay her devout and
admiring homage.
	He could not now shake off oppres-
sive thoughts concerning Guida and this
betrothal. They interwove themselves
through all his secret business with the
Royalists of Bercy. It was a relief when
the morning of the third day caine,
bright and joyous, and he knew that
before the sun went down he should be
on his way back to Saumur.
	His friend the innkeeper urged him
not to attend the meeting of the states
of Bercy, lest he should be recognized by
the spies of government~ He was, how-
ever, firm in his resolution to go, but he
exchanged his coat with the red cross
for one less conspicuous.
	With the morning of the eventful day
came the news that the envoy to Eng-
land had returned with Philips freedom
by exchange of prisoners, and the need-
ful license from the English King. But
other news, too, was carrying through
the town: the French government, hav-
ing learned of the plan regarding Phil-
ip, had dispatched envoys to forbid the
act of adoption and the deed of succes-
sion. Though the duke would have de-
fied them, it behooved him to end the
matter, if possible, before the arrival of
these envoys. The assembly was hur-
riedly convened two hours before the
time appointed, and the race began be-
tween the old nobleman and the emissa-
ries of the French government.
	The assembly being opened, in a
breathless silence the governor-general
of the duchy read aloud the license of
the King of England permitting Philip
dAvranche, an officer in his navy, to
assume the honors to be conferred upon
him by the duke and the states of
Bercy. Then the president of the states
read aloud the order of succession : 
	~ rro the hereditary prince, Leopold
John, and his heirs male; in default of
which to
	2. The prince successor, Philip
dAvranche, and his heirs male; in de-
fault of which to
	3. The heir male of the house of
Vaufontaine.
	Afterward came reading of the deed
of gift by which certain possessions in
the province of dAvranche were made
over to Prince Philip. To all this the
assent of Prince Leopold John had been
formally secured.
	After the assembly and the chief officers
of the due by should have ratified these
documents, and the duke should have
signed them, they were to be inclosed in
a box with three locks and deposited with
the sovereign court at Bercy. Duplicates,</PB>

also, were to be sent to London and re-
gistered in the records of the College of
Arms. The states, amid great enthusi-
asmn, at once ratified the documents by
unanimous vote. The one notable dissen-
tient was the intendant, Comute Carignan
Damour, lately become a strong ally of
the French government. It was he who
had given Fouch6 information concern-
ing Philips adoption; it was also he who
had at last, through his spies, discovered
D6tricands presence in the town, and had
taken action thereupon. In the states,
however, he had no vote, and wisdom
kept him silent, though he was watchful
for any opportunity to delay the pro-
ceedings until the arrival of the French
envoys. They should soon be here, nnd
he watched the doors anxiously. He
had a double motive in preventing this
new succession. With Philip as adopt-
ed son and heir there would be fewer
spoils of office; with Philip as duke there
would be none at all, for the instinct of
antipathy and distrust was mutual. Be-
sides, he was a Republican at heart, and
looked for reward from Fouch6 in good
time.
	Presently it was announced by the
president that the signatures to the acts
would be set in private. Thereupon,
with all the concourse standing, the duke,
surrounded by the law, military, and
civil officers of the duchy, girded upon
Philip the jeweled sword which had
been handed down in the house of
dAvranche from generation to gener-
ation. The open function being thus
ended, the people were enjoined to pro-
ceed at once to the cathedral, where a
Te Deum would be sung.
	The public then retired, leaving the
duke and a few of the highest officials
of the duchy to sign and seal the deeds.
When the outer doors were closed, one
unofficial person remained,  Comte D4.
tricand de Tournay, of the house of Van-
fontaine.
	D&#38; ricand stood leaning against a pil-
Jar, looking complacently yet seriously
at the group surrounding the duke at the
great council-table. Suddenly the latter
turned to a door at the right of the
presidents chair, and, opening it, bowed
courteously to some one beyond. An in-
stant afterward there entered the Coin-
tesse Chantavoine with her uncle the
Marquis Graudjon-Larisse, an aged, fee-
ble, but distinguished figure. They ad-
vanced toward the table, and Philip,
saluting them gravely, offered the mar-
quis a chair. At first the marquis de-
clined it, but the duke pressed him, and
in the subsequent proceedings he of all
the number was seated.
	D~tricand apprehended the meaning
of the scene. This was the lady whom
the duke had chosen for the wife of the
new prince.. He had invited her to wit-
ness the final act which was to make
Philip dAvranche his heir in legal fact
as by verbal proclamation, not doubting
that the romantic nature of the inci-
dent would appeal to her. lie had even
hoped that the function might be fol-
lowed by a formal betrothal in the pre-
sence of the officers of the duchy; and
the situation might still have been criti-
cal for Philip had it not been for the
pronounced reserve of the countess her-
self.
	She was tall, of gracious and stately
but not lissome carriage; the curious
quietness of her face would have been
almost an unbecoming gravity, had not
the eyes, clear, dark, and strong, light-
ened it. The mouth had sweetness, but
it was a somewhat set sweetness, even
as the face was somewhat fixed in its
calm. In her bearing and in all her
motions there was a regal quality; yet,
too, something of isolation, of withdraw-
al, in her self-possession and unruffled
observation. She seemed, to D6tricand,
a figure apart; a woman whose friend-
ship would be everlasting, but whose
love would be more an affectionate habit
than a pnssion, and in whom devotion
would be strong, because devotion was
the keynote of her nature. The dress</PB>

of a nun would have turned her into a
saint, of a peasant would have made her
a Madonna, of a Quaker would have
made her a dreamer and a d6vote, of a
queen would have made her benign yet
unapproachable. It struck him all at
once, as he looked, that this woman had
one quality in absolute kinship with
Guida Landresse,  honesty of mind and
nature; only with this young aristocrat
the honesty would be without passion.
She had straightforwardness, a firm but
limited intellect, a clear-mindedness be-
longing somewhat to narrowness of out-
look, but a genuine capacity for un-
derstanding the right and the wrong
of things. Guida, D&#38; ricand thought,
might break her heart and live on; this
woman would break her heart and die.
The one would grow larger through suf-
fering; the other, narrow into a numb
coldness.
	So he entertained himself for the mo-
ment by these flashes of discernment,
presently merged in wonderment as to
what was in Philips mind as he stood
there,  destiny hanging in that drop of
ink at the point of the pen in the dukes
fingers.
	Philip was thinking of the destiny, but
more than all else just now he was think-
ing of the woman before him, and the
issue to be faced by him concerning her.
His thoughts were not so clear nor so
discerning as D6tricands. No more than
he understood Guida did he understand
this clear-eyed, quiet, self-possessed wo-
man before him. He thought her cold,
unsympathetic, barren of that glow which
should set the pulses of a man like him-
self bounding. It did not occur to him
that those still waters ran deep; that to
awaken this seemingly glacial nature, to
kindle a fire upon this altar, would be
to secure unto his lifes end a steady,
enduring flame of devotion. He revolt-
ed from her; not alone because he had
a wife already, but because the countess
chilled him,  because with her, in any
case, he would never be able to play
the passionate lover as he had done with
Guida; and not to be the passionate
lover was to be no lover at all. One
thing only appealed to him: she was the
Comtesse Chantavoine, a fitting consort
in the eyes of the world for a sovereign
duke. He could not but think well of
himself in this auspicious hour, more than
a little carried off his feet by the marvel
of the situation. But still he could think
of nothing quite clearly; everything was
confused and shifting in his mind.
	He soon became aware that the duke
was speaking, and, looking up, was con-
scious of the eyes of the intendant fixed
upon him with a curious covert antipathy.
The dukes words had been merely an
informal greeting to his council and the
high officers present. He was about to
speak further, however, but some one
drew his attention to Detricand. An or-
der was given to challenge the stranger;
but D~tricand advanced toward the ta-
ble, and said, The Due de Bercy will
not forbid the attendance of his cousin,
D6tricand de Tonrnay, at this impressive
2 
ceremony.
	The duke, dunifounded, though he pre-
served an outward calm, could not answer
for an instant. Then, with a triumphant,
vindictive smile which puckered his yel-
low cheeks like a wild apple, he said,
The Comte de Tournay is welcome to
behold the end of the ambitions of the
Vaufontaines. He looked toward Philip
with an exulting pride and coinmenda-
tion. Monsieur le Comte is quite right,
he added, turning to his council; he
may always claim the privileges of a re-
lative of the Bercys, but the hospitality
extends no further than my house and my
presence, and Jllionsieur le Comte will
understand my meaning.
	At that moment D6tricand caught the
eye of the intendant, and then he un-
derstood perfectly. This man, the inn-
keeper had told him, was reported to be
secretly a devout Republican, and from
the intendants look he knew himself to
be in immediate danger.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00098" SEQ="0098" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="92">	92	The Battle of the Strong.

	Without hesitation, however, bowing
to all, and making no reply to the duke
save a simple I thank your highness,
he took a place near the council-table.
	The short ceremony of signing the
deeds immediately followed. A few
formal questions were asked of Philip,
to which he briefly replied; afterward
he made the oath of allegiance to the
duke and the duchy, with his hand upon
the sword of the dAvranches. These
preliminaries ended, the duke was just
stooping to put his pen to the paper for
signature when the intendant, as much
for the purpose of annoying Philip as of
still delaying the proceedings, said, It
would appear that one question has been
omitted in the formalities of this court.
He paused dramatically. He was only
aiming a random shot; he would make
the most of it.
	The duke looked up, perturbed, and
said sharply, What is that,  what is
that, monsieur?
	A formality, Monsieur le Duc, a
mere formality. Monsieur  he bowed
toward Philip politdly  monsieur is
not already married? There is no 
He paused again.
	Standing erect and rigid, with his pen
poised, the duke glanced sharply at the
intendant, and then still more sharply at
Philip. The progress of that look had
granted Philip an instants time to recov-
er his composure. He was conscious that
the Comtesse Chantavoine had given a
little start, and then had become quite
still and calm. Now her eyes were in-
tently fixed upon him.
	For an instant there was absolute still-
ness. Philip had felt his heart give one
great thump of terror. Did Detricand
know anything? Did the intendant
know anything? He had, however, been
too often in physical danger to lose his
nerve now. The moment was big with
peril; it was the turning-point of his life,
and he felt it. His eyes dropped toward
the spot of ink at the point of the pen
which the duke held: it fascinated him,
it was destiny. Now he took a step near-
er to the table, and, drawing himself up,
looked his princely interlocutor steadily
in the eyes.
	Of course there is no marriage  no,
woman? asked the duke a little hoarse-
ly, his eyes fastened on Philips.
	With steady voice Philip replied,
Of course, Monsieur le Duc.
	There was another stillness. Some
one sighed heavily. It was the Coin-
tesse Chantavoine.
	Then the duke stooped, and wrote his
signature three times hurriedly upon the
deeds.

	A moment afterward D&#38; ricand was
in the street, making toward the Gold-
en Crown. As he hurried on he heard
the galloping of horses ahead of him.
Suddenly some one plucked him by the
arm from a doorway. Inside, quick!
said a voice. It was that of the dukes
porter, Frange Pergot. Without hesita-
tion or a word D~tricand did as he was
bid, and the door closed behind him.
	Fouch(s men are coming down the
street; spies have betrayed you, whis-
pered Pergot. Follow me. I will
hide you till night, and then you niust
escape.~~
	What Pergot had said was quite true.
But D6tricand was safely hidden, and
Fouch6s men arrived too late to forbid
those formal acts which made Philip
dAvranche a prince, or to capture the
Vendean chief, who, a week later, once
again at Saumur, wrote a long letter
to Carterette Mattingley, in Jersey, in
which he set forth these strange events
at Bercy, and asked certain questions
concerning Guida.


XXIV.

	Since the day of his secret marriage
with Guida, Philip had been carried
along in the gale of naval preparations
and incidents of war as a leaf is borne</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00099" SEQ="0099" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="93">	f/ike Battle of the Strong.	93

onward by a storm,  no looking back,
to-morrow always the goal. But as a
wounded traveler nurses carefully his
hurt, seeks shelter from the scorching
sun and from the dank air, and travels
by little stages lest he never come at all
to friendly hostel, so Guida made her
way slowly through the months of win-
ter and of spring.
	In the past, it had been February to
Guida because the yellow Lenten lilies
grew in all the sheltered c6tils; March
because the periwinkle and the lords
and ladies came; May because the cliffs
were a blaze of golden gorse, and the
perfume thereof made all the land sweet
as a honeycomb.
	Then came the other months, with
hawthorn trees and hedges all in blow;
the lilac gladdening the doorways, the
honeysuckle in bloomy thickets; the ox-
eyed daisy of Whitsuntide; the yellow
rose of St. Brelade, that lies down in
the sand and stands up in the hedges;
the mergots, which, like good soldiers,
are first in the field and last out of it; the
unseented dog-violets, the yellow prim-
roses, the daffodils and snowdrops, the
buttercups, orchises, and celandines; the
laurustinus and privet and blackthorn
hedges so green; the osier beds, and the
ivy on every barn ; the purple thrift in
masses on the cliff; the sea-thistle in its
glaucous green,   the laughter of the
fields whose laugh was gold. And all
was summer.
	Came a time thereafter when the
children of the poor gathered blackber-
ries for preserves and home-made wine;
when the wild stock flowered in St.
Onens Bay; when the bracken fern was
gathered from every cOtil, and dried for
apple-storing, fire-lighting, and bedding
for the cherished cow, for back-rests for
the veilles, and for seats round the win-
ter fire; when peaches, apricots, and
nectarines made the walls sumptuous red
and gold; when the wild plum and crab-
apple flourished in the secluded road-
ways, and the tamarisk dropped its
brown pods upon the earth. And all
this was autumn.
	At last, when came the birds of pas-
sage, the snipe and teal and barnacle
geese, and the rains began; when the
green lizard with its turquoise - blue
throat vanished; when the Jersey cra-
paud was heard croaking no longer in
the valleys and the ponds, and the cows
were well blanketed,  then winter had
come again.
	Such were the associations of the sea-
sons in Guidas mind until one day of a
certain year, when for a few hours a
man had called her his wife, and then
had sailed away. There was no log
that might thereafter record the days
and weeks which unwound the coils of
an endless chain into that sea whither
Philip had gone.
	Letters she had had, to be sure,  two
letters ; but how many times, when a
packet had come in, had she gone to the
doorway and watched for old M~re Ros-
signol making the rounds with her han
basket, chanting the names of those for
whom she had letters; and how many
times did she go back to the kitchen
choking down a sob!
	The first letter was at once a blessing
and a blow; it was a reassurance and it
was a misery. It spoke of bread, as it
were, yet it offered a stone. It elo-
quently, passionately told of Philips
love; but it also told, with a torturing
ease, that the Araminta was under com-
mand to proceed to sea with sealed or-
ders. And so, the letter said, he did
not know when he should see her nor
when he should be able to write again.
War had been declared against France,
and they might not touch a port nor have
chance to send a letter by a homeward
vessel for weeks, and maybe months.
This was painful, but it was fate, and it
was his profession, and it could not be
helped. Of course, she must understand,
he would write constantly, telling her, as
through a kind of diary, what he was
doing every day; and then when the</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00100" SEQ="0100" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="94">	94	The Battle of the Strong.
chance offered the big budget should go
to her.
	A pain came to Guidas heart, pier-
cing the joy which had overwhelmed it,
as she read the flowing tale of his buoy-
ant love. She knew that she could not
have written so smoothly of fate and
profession, nor told of this separation
with so complaisant a sorrow, had she
been the man and he the woman. With
her the words would have been wrenched
forth from her heart, would have been
scarred into the paper with the bitterness
of a spirit tried beyond its enduring.
	With what enthusiasm did Philip, im-
mediately after his heart-breaking news,
write of what this war might do for
him,  what avenues of advancement it
might open up, what splendid chances it
would offer for success in his career!
Did he mean that to comfort her? she
asked herself. Did he mean it to divert
her from the pain of the separation, to
give her something to hope for? She
read the letter over and over again, and
 no, she could not, though her heart
was so willing, find that meaning in it.
It was all Philip,  Philip full of hope,
purpose, prowess, ambition. Did he
think  did he think that that could
ease the pain, could lighten the dark
day settling down on her? Could he
imagine that anything might compensate
for his absence in the coming months, in
this year of all years in her life? Oh,
did he not know? His lengthened ab-
sence might be inevitable, it might be
fate, but could he not see the bitter cru-
elty of it? He had said that he would
be back with her again in two months;
and now  ah, did he not know?
	As the weeks again came and went
she felt indeed he did not know.
	Some natures cling to beliefs long af-
ter conviction has been shattered and
disproved. These are they of the limit-
ed imagination, the loyal, the pertina-
cious, and the affectionate, the single-
hearted children of habit; blind where
they do not wish to see, stubborn where
their inclinations lie, unamenable to rea-
son, wholly held by their legitimate ob-
ligations.
	But Guida was not of these. Her
brain and imagination were strong as
her affections. Her incurable honesty
was the deepest thing in her; she did
not even know how to deceive herself.
As her experience deepened under the
influence of a sorrow which still was joy,
and a joy which still was sorrow, her
vision became acute and piercing. Her
brain was like some kaleidoscope. Pic-
tures of things, little and big, which had
happened to her in her life, at moments
flashed by her inner sight in furious pro-
cession. It was as if, in the photographic
machinery of the brain, a shutter had
slipped from its place, and a hundred un-
ordered and ungoverned pictures, loosed
from their natural restraint, rushed by.
	Months had passed since Philip had
left her, a month since she had received
his second letter,  a month of complex-
ity of feeling; of tremulousness of dis-
covery; of hungry eagerness for news
of the war; of sudden little outbursts
of temper in her household life,  a new
thing in her experience; of passionate
touches of tenderness toward her grand-
father; of occasional biting comments in
the conversations between the sieur and
the chevalier, causing the gentlemen to
look at each other in silent amazement;
of as marked lapses into listless disregard
of any talk that went on around her.
	She had been used often to sit still,
doing nothing, in a sort of physical con-
tent, as the sieur and his visitors talked;
now her hands were always busy, at
knitting, sewing, or spinning, the steady
gaze upon her work showing that her
thoughts were far away. Though the
chevalier and her grandfather vaguely
noted the change, they as vaguely set it
down to her growing womanhood. In
any case, they held it was not for them
to comment upon a woman or upon a
womans ways. And a girl like Guida
was an incomprehensible being, with an</PB>

orbit and a system all her own,  whose
sayings and doings were as little to be
reduced to their understanding as the
vagaries of any star in the Milky Way
or the currents in St. Michaels Basin.
	One evening she sat before the fire
thinking of Philip. Her grandfather
had retired earlier than usuaL Biribi,
the dog, lay asleep on the veille. There
was no sound save the ticking of the
clock on the mantel above her head,
Biribis slow breathing, the snapping of
the log on the fire, and a soft rush of
heat up the chimney. The words of
Philips letters, learned by heart, and
from which she had extracted every
atom of tenderness they held, were al-
ways in her ears. At last one phrase
kept repeating itself like some refrain,
which becomes plaintive through repeti-
tion, then torturing in its mournful sug-
gestion. It was this: But you see,
dearest, that though I am absent from
you I shall have such splendid chances
to get on. There s no limit to what
this war may do for me.
	Suddenly Guida realized how different
was her love from Philips, how differ-
ent was her place in his life from his
place in her life. She reasoned with
herself, because she knew that a mans
life was work in the world, and that
work and ambition were in his bones
and in his blood, had been carried down
to him through centuries of industrious,
ambitious generations of men,  that
men were one race, and women were an-
other. A man was bound by the condi-
tions of life governing the profession by
which he earned his bread and butter,
played his part in the world, and strove
to reach the seats of honor in high places.
He must either live by the law, fulfill to
the letter his daily duties of the business
of life, or drop out of the race; and a
woman, with bitterness and tears, in the
presence of mans immoderate ambition,
must learn to pray, Lord, have mercy
up us, a incline our hearts to keep
this law.
	Quickly the whole thing resolved it-
self in Guidas mind, and her thinking
came to a full stop. She understood
now what was the right and what the
wrong, and, child as she was in years,
woman that she was in experience and
thought, yielding to the impulse of the
moment, she buried her face in her
hands and burst into tears.
	Oh, Philip, Philip, Philip, she
sobbed aloud, it was not right of you
to marry me; it was wicked of you to
leave me! Then in her thoughts she
carried on the impeachment and re-
proach. If he had married her openly
and left her at once, it would have been
hard to bear, but in the circumstances
it might have been right. If he had
married her secretly and left her at the
altar, so keeping the promise he had
made her when she agreed to become
his wife, that might have been pardon-
able. But to marry her as he did, and
then, breaking his solemn vow, leave
her,  it was not right in her eyes; and
if not right in the eyes of her who loved
him, in whose would it be right?
	To these definitions she had come at
last. It is an eventful moment, a crucial
ordeal, for a woman, when she forces
herself to see the naked truth concern-
ing the man whom she has loved, yet the
man who ha wronged her. She is born
anew in that moment: it may be to love
on, to blind herself, and condone and
defend, so lowering her own moral tone;
or to congeal in heart, become keener in
intellect, scornful and bitter with her own
sex and merciless toward the other, in-
different to blame and careless of praise,
intolerant, judging all the world by her
own experience, and incredulous of any
true thing. Or yet again, she may be-
come deeper, stronger, sadder, wiser;
condoning nothing, minimizing nothing,
deceiving herself in nothing, and still
never forgiving at least one thing,  the
destruction of innocent faith and a noble
credulity; seeing clearly and acutely the
whole wrong; with a strong intelligence</PB>

measuring perfectly the iniquity, but out
of a largeness of nature and by virtue
of a high sense of duty devoting her days
to the salvation of a mans honor, to the
betterment of one weak or wicked na-
ture.
	Of these last was Guida.
	Oh, Philip, Philip, you have been
wicked to me!  she sobbed.
	Her tears fell upon the stone hearth,
and the fire dried them, and every tear-
drop was one girlish feeling and emotion
gone, one bright fancy, one tender hope,
vanished.
	She was no longer a girl. There were
troubles and dangers ahead of her, but
she must now face them dry-eyed and
alone. In his second letter Philip had
told her to announce the marriage, and
had said that he would write to her
grandfather explaining all, and also to
the Reverend Lorenzo Dow.
	She had waited and watched for that
letter to her grandfather, but it had not
come. As for Loreuzo Dow, he was a
prisoner with the French.
	There was yet another factor in the
affair. While the island was still agog
over Mr. Dows misfortune, there had
been a bold robbery at St. Michaels
Rectory of the strong-box containing the
Communion plate, the parish taxes for
the year, the offertories for the month,
and  what was of moment to at least
one person  the parish register of
deaths, baptisms, and marriages. The
box was found on the seashore, but that
was all. Thus it was that now no hu-
man being in Jersey could vouch that
Guida had been married.
	Yet these things troubled her little.
How easily could Philip set all right!
If he would but come back,  that at
first was her only thought; for what
matter a ring, or any proof, testimony,
or proclamation, without Philip!
	It did not occur to her at first that
all these things were needed to save her
from shame in the eyes of the world. If
she had thought of them apprehensively,
she would have said to herself, How
easy to set all right by simply announ-
cing the marriage! And she would
have done so when war was declared
and Philip received his new command,
but that she wished the announcement
to come from him. Well, that would
come in any case when Philips letter to
her grandfather arrived: no doubt it had
missed the packet by which hers came.
	But another packet, and yet another
arrived; and still there was no letter
from Philip for the Sieur de Mauprat.
Winter had come, and spring had gone,
and now summer was at hand. Hay-
making was beginning, the wild straw-
berries were reddening among the clo-
ver, and in her little garden apples had
followed the buds on the trees beneath
which Philip had told his fateful tale of
love.
	At last a third letter arrived,  bring-
ing little joy to her heart, however. It
declared love and affection, it was even
extravagant in terms of affection; but
somehow it fell short of the true thing,
for its ardor was that of a mind preoc-
cupied, and underneath all ran a cur-
rent of inherent selfishness. It delighted
in the activity of his life, it was full of
hope, of promise of happiness for them
both in the future, but it had no solici-
tude for Guida in the present. It chilled
her heart  so warm but a little season
ago  that Philip, to whom she had once
ascribed strength, tenderness, profound
thoughtfulness, should concern himself so
little in the details of her life. For the
most part, his letters seemed those of an
ardent lover who knew his duty and did
it gladly, but with a self-conscious and
flowing eloquence, too, which could have
cost but little strain of feeling.
	He was curious to know what the peo-
ple in Jersey said about their marriage.
He had written to Lorenzo Dow and her
grandfather, he said, but had heard af-
terward that the vessel carrying the let-
ters had been taken by a French pri-
vateer; and so they had not arrived in</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00103" SEQ="0103" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="97">	The Battle of the Strong.	97

Jersey. But of course she had told her
grandfather and all the island of the
ceremony performed at St. Michaels.
He was sending her fifty pounds, his
first contribution to their home; and,
the war over, a beautiful home she cer-
tainly should have. He would write to
her grandfather again, though this day
there was no time to do so.
	But Guida had not proclaimed the
marriage. She had lived the first months
of her wedded life in an aching stillness
of secrecy; she had suffered tremors, and
apprehensions, and changing moods, and
troubled, fevered hours alone, with no
confidant, with no supporting tenderness
from mother, sister, friend, or husband.
	She realized now that she must an-
nounce the marriage at once. But yet
what proofs of it had she? There was
the ring Philip had given her, inscribed
with their names; hut she was sophis-
ticated enough to know that this would
not be adequate evidence in the eyes of
her Jersey neighbors. The marriage re-
gister, with its record, was stolen, and
that proof was gone. Lastly, there were
Philips letters; hut no,  a thousand
times no!  she would not show Philips
letters to any human being; even the
thought of it hurt her pride, her delicacy
of feeling, her self-respect. Her heart
burned with bitterness to think that there
had been a secret marriage. How hard
it was, at this distance of time, to tell the
world the tale, and to be forced to prove
it by Philips letters! No, no, she could
not do it,  not yet. She would still wait
the arrival of Philips letter to her grand-
father. If it did not come soon, then
she must be brave and tell her story.
	She went to the Vier Marchi less now;
also fewer folk stood gossiping with her
grandfather in the Place du Vier Prison
or by the well at the front door,  so far
she had not wondered why. To be sure,
Maitresse Aimable came oftener; but
since one notable day at Sark Guida had
resolutely avoided reference, however
oblique, to Philip and herself. Still, in
her dark days the only watchful eye upon
her was that of the egregiously fat old
woman called the femme de ballast,
whose thick tongue dave to the roof of
her mouth, whose outer attractions were
so meagre that even her husbands chief
sign of affection was to pull her great
toe, passing her bed of a morning to light
the fire.
	Carterette Mattingley also came, but
another friend who had watched over
Guida for years before Philip appeared
in the Place du Vier Prison never en-
tered her doorway now. Only once or
twice since that day on the Ecr6hos, so
fateful to them both, had Guida seen
Ranulph Delagarde. He had withdrawn
to St. Aubins Bay, where his trade of
ship-building was carried on, and having
fitted up a small cottage, lived a seclud-
ed life with his father there. Neither of
them appeared often in St. Heliers, and
they were seldom or never seen in the
Yier Marchi.
	Carterette saw IRanulph little oftener
than did Guida, but she knew what he
was doing, being anxious to know, and
every ones business being every one
elses business in Jersey. In the same
way Ranulph knew of Guida. What
Carterette was doing Ranulph was not
concerned to know, and so knew little;
and Guida knew and thought little of
how Ranulph fared: which was part of
the selfishness of love.
	But one day Carterette received a let-
ter from France which excited her great-
ly, and sent her off hot-foot to Guida;
and in the same hour Ranulph heard a
piece of hateful gossip which made him
fell to the ground the man who told him,
and sent him with white face, and sick,
affrighted, yet indignant heart, to the
cottage in the Place da Vier Prison.

cide matters quite properly within the
scope of our own judgment. We study
it, therefore, not in the hope of under-
standing through its help the speech we
all think with and cannot escape from,
but in the hope of obtaining a standard
of correctness in the use of language
which may separate us from the vulgar
who know not grammar. Such an ideal
rests upon a false conception of the na-
ture of language and upon ignorance of
the history of English speech, as ~el1 as
upon an inadequate and selfish ideal of
culture.
	Let us examine for a moment, very
generally and briefly, the nature of lan-
guage. Setting aside the question of
its origin, and starting rather from the
biological principle that the history of
the individual repeats the history of the
type, let us think of the development of
any one of us in respect to his acquiring
and using speech. The early period of
this development knows not literature;
and there can be a considerable profi-
ciency in the use of speech without a
knowledge of literature. Nor, theoreti-
cally speaking, is there any point in the
development of language where the know-
ledge of literature becomes indispensable
to the existence of speech. Nor has the
written language, at least in English, any
existence apart and independent from
the spoken language. The written word,
then, is not an essential part of language,
and for our present purpose we can leave
it aside. Beginning with the spoken lan-
guage as the essential language, let us
think for a moment how it is acquired.
Each normally constituted person who
comes into life learns to think in terms of
the words he hears from those about him,
until the use of them becomes as much an
unconscious habit with him as walking.
The language which he learns in this way
was learned in the same way by those he
hears use it, who in turn learned it from
others antecedent, and so on all the way
back until the line passes into the pre-
historic past. But the tradition thus car-
ned on is continually conditioned by in-
herited predisposition and environment,
which are always giving rise to minute
variations from the type. These varia-
tions, however seemingly accidental and
personal, are always making in a certain
direction, and cause the development of
language as a whole to follow definite
laws which it can no more escape than
matter can escape gravitation. Theset
laws are not subject to sudden or violent!
change. They cannot be set aside or
materially assisted by any sort of aca-
demic legislation or learned prescription.
They are beyond the control of the in-
dividual as well. He may say how he
will use language and explain his method
to the people with whom he comes di-
rectly in contact, giving them the key to
his idiom, but he cannot affect language
itself. His idiom will die with him, in
spite of all his effort. Universal teach-
ing, too, of a particular idiom may fix
it temporarily upon the language; but
unless it accord with some easy analogy
which will naturally lead to its general
use, the idiom will not remain, but will
only form a temporary obstruction to the
free development of language, like a snag
sticking out into a stream. School-teach-
ers may come and school-teachers may
go, but they cannot correct bad
English, if the correction is against
the genius and spirit of English thought~
	One of the richest contributions of
modern scholarship is the knowledge
that this development obeys natural laws
of thought, and that, however inscrutable
during a short period, it is perfectly
clear and continuous over a long one.
The next step will be to show that the
reason for this lies in the nature of lan-
guage; that the uniformity of its devel-
opment is but the expression of a deep-
er uniformity of thought itself through
which the brain unconsciously selects cer-
tain associations to make habitual; that
the words we say or write down are but
a small part of the words we actually
use in thinking, day in, day out, year</PB>

after year, till the brain ceases to per-
form its function; that language is thus
part of a great act which began we
know not when, and will end only when
thought itself shall cease and silence reign
again.
	Our present starved conception of lan-
guage is like that we used to have of
biology, when we thought of animal life
in the world as of a gigantic menagerie,
designed by a demiurgic showman for
our instruction and pleasure. We fail to
recognize the real meaning of language
because we do not think of it as a part
of our life. We treat it as if it were yes-
terdays creation, not the growth of cen-
turies of experience. We still think of it
as being made up of parts of speech
to be used according to rules of syn-
tax.
	It was this notion which formed the
basis of the ancient method of studying
grammar. Parts of speech were the
necessary outcome of scholastic logic.
For it the most important things were
names and categories; and so nouns,
the names of things, made the first
chapter of grammar; pronouns came in
as the next; adjectives, as expressing
attributes, next; and so on, a set of me-
chanically constructed categories of think-
ing, with appropriate definitions and
fixed rules of cotrdination. The ac-
cidents of such parts of speech as were
capable of accidence were then care-
fully labeled and pigeonholed for future
reference or use. The making out of
these tables presented a fine opportunity
for formal logic, and the resulting para-
digms made the real basis of this sort of
study. These were learned as the pat-
terns of thinking, and their perfection
being possible only in a language like
classic Latin, where a complicated sys-
tem of Indo-Germanic inflection was ar-
tificially preserved, such a language Le-
came the type by which all others were
measured. To form these parts of
speech with their accidents into predica-
tions was the next step. There was the
	subject,  attribute,  predicate,
and complement, with their various
	concords:  this made syntax. Again,
these things were logically clear in Latin:
so Latin syntax became the norm of
English syntax. It was an easy matter
to tack on Latin prosody, and the system
was complete. What was good enough
for Latin and Greek was surely good
enough for English. This grammar was
supplemented by an Etymology, in
which the etyma were the Latin and
Greek words corresponding to the various
English borrowings from these tongues.
Others were practically ignored.
	Such a grammar has for its basis in-
flection, and for its unit a part of speech.
Hence we had  and still have to some
extent  inflection playing the chief rOle
in the grammar of a language whose
tendency has been to shuffle off inflec-
tions as fast as possible. The practical
aim of its system was to teach the stu-
dent the concords as they would be if
English were a highly inflected language.
Its chief concern, therefore, was to get
the right form of inflection for various
syntactical usages; just the point where
the student, who had learfied to use in-
flections when he was learning to talk,
could not easily go astray. This sort
of grammar considered the study of lan-
guage as something quite apart from
the use of language; its end was perfect
mechanical thinking by means of formu-
las, not perfect natural thinking based
upon experience. Its standpoint was
metaphysical, and was possible only for
a dead language. A living speech like
English develops ever at variance with
such a priori reasoning, and the cleft
has been long apparent.
	Now it would be unjust in us to charge
our ancestors with the ignorance of the
real nature of English grammar implied
in this conception of the subject, and to
find fault with them in their effort to
build a didactic grammar upon distinc-
tions found in Latin, and not upon the
nature of English. But we can charge</PB>

ourselves with folly in persisting to ig-
nore the material that the last few de-
cades have furnished for the scientific
study of the subject, and in holding to
their inadequate notion when a richer
and better is within our reach.
	The real nature of English grammar
is not metaphysical, but historical. It is
the scientific study of a living language
in the light of its development. The
history of the development may not form
a part of the actual grammatical treat-
ment, but it must underlie it. The gram-
mar may be one of late New English,
say, restricted to the consideration of
only those phenomena which come un-
der our immediate notice, and may have
nothing to do with Middle English or
Old English. But these phenomena are
only scientifically intelligible in the light
of their development, and must be studied
from an historical basis. In this sense
there is for English but one kind of
grammar, and that is historical gram-
mar. The terms and definitions of scho-
lastic grammar have their place and use,
and are in many cases necessary as be-
ing general to all thinking and to all
language. The categories, too, are those
of thought in general, and are therefore
inevitable in describing and classifying
the facts of language. But they are not
grammar, and learning them is not study-
ing grammar, any more than learning
the divisions of the animal kingdom is
studying biology. Grammar, to be pro-
perly studied, must be based on the na-
ture of language itself, and on the his-
tory of its development.
	This has been the belief of the best
scholars for a number of years, and their
study of the subject in this spirit has de-
veloped a new method. But it has for
the most part remained the method of
scholars, and of comparatively few schol-
ars at that. The scientific treatment of
the subject is traceable chiefly to Jacob
Grimm, though we had beginnings of it
in English scholarship as early as the
days of Franciscus Junius and George
Hickes. The Germans, who were the
first to turn their attention to the matter,
made the earliest advances in the field
of English; for a knowledge of English
has long been recognized in Germany to
be essential to the proper understanding
of German. The method they have fol-
lowed has been historical, empirical;
and following it, the best scholars have
succeeded in establishing the unity of our
language and literature, and the continu-
ity of their historical development. Eng-
lish and American scholarship has made
use of their work, and has added substan-
tial contributions to it, though often in
a rather dull and imitative fashion and
without a clear realization of the pur-
pose of it all. But English and Amer-
ican schools and universities have been
slow to see the value of this sort of schol-
arship, and what is more the pity, to see
its practical relation to the every-day life
and thought of English-speaking people.
What is wanted now is a keener appreci-
ation of the practical importance of this
scientific grammar and its fitness to be
used as a basis for English culture.
	It is difficult to describe this new gram-
mar without entering into somewhat te-
dious detail; but perhaps it will not be
impossible, in a few words, to give a gen-
eral idea of its scope and method. Its
chief divisions are, Sounds, Inflections,
Syntax, and Rhythm. Its ultimate unit
is a single sound. A word cannot express
thought unless its component sounds are
accurately reproduced, and its sounds are
subject to development. If I take the
word bear and change it to beer, I have
made in it but a small alteration, and one
that is quite in accord with the history
of English; yet I have altered the word
so that it no longer suggests the thought
it suggested before the change was made,
but something quite different. It is as
much of a change as I should make in
120 by changing the 2 to a 9. So I
might do with almost any other word,
destroying it entirely by slightly altering
in an arbitrary way one of the sounds</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00108" SEQ="0108" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="102">	102	English Historical Grammar.
which make it up. It is not words, then,
but sounds that are the ultimate things
in grammar. These sounds, moreover,
have as it were a life of their own, which
slowly changes their character with the
progress of centuries. The changes are
so gradual as to be imperceptible during
a single generation, yet they affect all
sounds where the same conditions are
present, and affect them in the same way.
To illustrate: the infinitive to make was
represented by macian in English of the
ninth century, by maken in English of
the twelfth century, by m~1cen in English
of the fourteenth century, by m~ik in
English of the sixteenth century, m~k in
English of the seventeenth, m~~k in Eng-
lish of the nineteenth. Here the vowel
a has been changing its character about
once in two centuries. And so with all
as under similar conditions. Conso-
nants, too, as well as vowels, alter their
nature in the development, but much
more slowly. These alterations are grad-
ual, so that the mind adapts itself to
them without knowing it; just as many
people nowadays would take their oath
that they pronounce the initial h in which
as in whist, but all the while they are
saying wich. To hear a word accurately
requires a carefully trained ear, and a
power, not easily acquired, of diverting
ones attention to the sounds of the word
as acoustic phenomena. These changes
are so general and so numerous as to af-
fect the whole character of the language;
so that English even of so recent a date
as Shakespeares would sound to us al-
most like a foreign tongue did we hear it,
and at many points would be quite unin-
telligible. Yet it is the same language,
just as Alfreds is, and with the key of a
scientific knowledge of English will yield
up its English thought to us with the very
words it was written in.
	In this part of English historical gram-
mar, it is the significance of the develop-
ment of the sounds, and not that of their
inconsequent representation, that is the
first thing to be grasped. We can change
the way of writing words a dozen times
a century; in fact, we might write them
a dozen ways at once without affect-
ing the sounds themselves. The spoken
words are the real things, not the letters
which signify them. This first chapter
on sounds is therefore the most impor-
tant of the whole subject; for without an
exact knowledge of it grammar will ap-
pear capricious and meaningless. This
field is left almost entirely to specialists,
and their work in it is thought to be too
trivial to interest the public. It is only
within recent years that the fact of the
development of English has been recog-
nized at all; so a clear statement of it in
English grammars has not been possible.
But the practical importance of such
knowledge as it now furnishes us is al-
most as great as our neglect of it has
been. While the study of the whole sub-
ject will bring us into a perfect under-
standing of our literature and will break
down our absurd notions of the nature
of our language, a complete knowledge
of this part of it is the most direct way
of accomplishing these ends; for the pe-
riod over which the development of Eng-
lish sounds extends is unusually long
and unusually rich in evidence afforded
by literature, and even an elementary
knowledge of it is sufficient to make the
development clear. Once this part of
the subject is fully understood, the stu-
dent will be in a fair way to understand
the growth of literature. He will at least
know enough not to be deceived, for in-
stance, into supposing that he is reading
Chaucer, when he thinks through his
brain the New English words which cor-
respond to Chaucers written forms, and
fills up the gaps with guesses. Nor will
he be misled by arbitrary forms of spell-
ing. He will see distinctly that the let-
ters do not represent the sounds they
pretend to represent, but quite a differ-
eat set. He will thus be prepared for a
more intelligent study of his literature,
and for a more vital and more powerful
mastery of his language.</PB>

	The division of scientific grammar
next in order is that which treats of in-
flections, and deals with the changes of
form which words undergo in being
modified for different phases and rela-
tions of the general ideas which they ex-
press. This chapter was made the chief
part of our earlier grammars of English,
because inflection is the most significant
characteristic of classic languages. But
English, owing to conditions peculiar to
it as a Germanic tongue, has made lit-
tle use of endings, and has depended
upon context and arrangement to make
thought clear; so that inflection plays a
very minor part in its grammar. Latin
and Greek retain a great many of the
early conditions of inflection found in
Indo-Germanic, where a stem represent-
ing a general idea was modified by some
change, most commonly by a flexional
syllable, to indicate the precise position,
condition, or relation which the word
assumes in the thought,  in terms of
logic, its accidents. For some reason or
~ other, Germanic peoples attached a pecu-
liar significance to the stem, and, utter-
ing it with greater force, neglected the
inflectional syllable. This process, once
begun, has gone on rapidly, until in mod-
ern English the old grammatical system
is almost entirely broken up. The dis-
covery that the accident of the word can
be sufficiently denoted by its position in
the thought, or by the accent it receives
in utterance, or by the context, or, when
necessary, by accurate and express de-
finition in other words, is the stepping-
stone to using it as a particular itself.
In English, therefore, we do not use a
general term modified by an accident in
order to make it a particular, but we
think the particular outright. My type-
writer, for instance, is as much a partic-
ular idea as my pen; I do not think of
the one as an instrument to write with
by means of type any more than I think
of the other as a feather adapted to pur-
poses of writing. So also when my type-
writer reproduces the thought for me on
paper, I do not think of it as type-
writer with a modification of the idea
to indicate that it is the subject of the
action; and when I wish to think of my-
self using the typewriter, I do not modify
the word for typewriter in a different
way to show that in this latter instance
the typewriter is the object of an action.
Such a distinction is quite useless. I
and my typewriter are two such different
things, with such different attributes and
functions, that there is no danger of any
one confusing the two. In almost any
possible thought where they are brought
together, the mind itself, without any
need of labels, will recognize their pro-
per grammatical relation. And even if
there was danger of confusion, the fact
that in English thinking the subject
comes first in the thought would be
sufficient to distinguish it without any
special mark. So with other types of
inflection. It is absurd, then, to study
English as a highly inflected language, 
to make the student think of such things
as 0 man as a vocative case, or to
a man as a dative, or if I do as a
subjunctive or conditional mood of the
verb do.
	The burden of the work has thus been
thrown upon syntax,  a syntax whose
perfection has developed in such a way as
to make all but the simplest inflection un-
necessary; and syntax, the third general
division of grammar, thus becomes most!
important for English. But it is not
the kind of syntax we know from Latin
grammar. That, owing to the full iii-
flectional system still preserved in Latin,
was a system of concords and artificial
agreements. Fixed syllables of inflec-
tion denoted certain accidents of a ge-
neric idea; syllables of inflection belong-
ing to the same or similar categories
pointed out the various parts of a whole
idea and their relations one to another,
so that the parts could be separated
from one another and scattered through
the sentence to secure formal symmetry
or pleasing cadence without confusion</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00110" SEQ="0110" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="104">	104	English Historical Grammar.

of the thought itself. The perception of
the significance of this accidence and
the arrangement of these collocations
were the field of syntax. The Germanic
languages, when they lost this full Judo-
Germanic system of inflection, lost also
with it the corresponding system of syn-
tax. What had been before an testhetic
end became now a practical one, and the
position of the words in the thought de-
noted their relation to one another. The
few inflections preserved were simplified
and reduced to great general categories,
such as number, objective and subjec-
tive case relation, distinction of sex, ab-
solute or conditional action. Nor has
this process of development ceased. It
is quite possible that the categories will
be still further reduced as time goes
on.	To study this development for
English is the field of syntax, and its
method is historical, since these arrange-
ments are traditional, depending upon
the habit of English thought. The sub-
ject has not yet received even in Ger-
many the attention it deserves, because a
scientific treatment of Laut- undEormen-
lehre (the development of sounds and
inflection) more than occupies the two-
semester course of a German university.
Then, too, German scholarship is often
embarrassed by the lack of the perfect
idiomatic familiarity with New English
syntax (enqlische Sprach9efilhl) neces-
sary to understand the habit of English
thought. A full and complete treatment
of it will have to come from English
scholars. Much has been done already
in such books as Matzners Englisehe
Grammatik, which starts with New Eng-
lish and works back to Old English, and
Kochs Englisehe Grammatik, which fol-
lows a more scientific order, beginning
with Old English and tracing the sub-
ject historically. The practical utility of
such study lies in the fact that it gives us
confidence in native English idioms, and
prevents those foolish alterations which
arise from an artificial notion of what
English syntax is.
	A fourth division of English grammar
is that which deals with rhythm and the
arrangement of words to make poetry.
The name Prosody is usually given to it,
because that is the title of the corre-
sponding division of Latin grammar. It
would take too long to show how this sub-
ject has been obscured by centuries of
misunderstanding and obstinate persist-
ence in teaching Latin prosody to explain
English rhythm. It was obvious that
Latin poetry had but two units, a short
and a long syllable. As accent took
the place of quantity when the system
was transferred to English, there were
two sorts of syllables recognized in
English prosody: a syllable was either
tum or it was ty. We have just
seen how the loss of Jndo-Germanic in-
flections affected Germanic syntax. The
cause of this loss, namely, the fixing of
the accent to a particular syllable of the
word in all its forms, broke down also
the Judo-Germanic system of rhythm.
It was no longer possible to write poetry
according to the classic system, because
the material for it no longer existed.
Germanic rhythm, therefore, assumed
an entirely new form, based upon the
new use of accent, and not upon quan-
tity, though it seems that in the earlier
periods quantity was still an element in
the verse. This system was used for
Old English, which very early developed
a rich poetic literature ; later on, anoth-
er kind of accentual system, which had
grown into wide use in medimeval Latin,
took its place. But not immediately and
violently; for English poetry had inde-
pendently been long working toward
this more regular media3val rhythm, and
thus received the new system as a graft,
and was not displaced and crowded out
by it. At no time in its history, there-
fore, has English verse been written like
classic poetry, for it has always been
based upon accentual, and not upon quan-
titative differences. But our study of
classic poetry has made us overlook the
exquisite gradations of accent in Eng</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00111" SEQ="0111" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="105">	English Historical Grammar.	105

lish verse, and has scaled our poetry
down to turn and ty. The appre-
ciation of more gradations than these
has been considered to be the concern of
elocution, not prosody, and poetry, made
to delight the ear with delicate rhythm,
becomes, when we study it, a wooden
arrangement of shorts and longs
into iambic acatalectic trimeters and
such things.
	To these four divisions, Sounds, In-
flections, Syntax, and Rhythm, should
logically be added a fifth, namely, the
Development of Word-Meanings. But
the historical dictionaries of English
are assuming this for their special field,
and rightly, too; so that there is no need
for any but the most general treatment
of the subject in English historical gram-
mar. The work in this field is most con-
veniently accessible when arranged in
the form of a dictionary. How impor-
tant such material is for the study of
English literature is shown by the great
number of hitherto misunderstood pas-
sages in Shakespeare which the Oxford
Dictionary clears up.
	We have thus traversed the field of
English historical grammar, and have
incidentally called attention to the meth-
od it pursues. Prosecuted in such a
way, the subject is as scientific as any
of the sciences now studied in the uni-
versities, and certainly deserves as con-
spicuous a place as any in university
curricula. For Americans it is practi-
cally a fresh field to work in; and when
the American genius for discerning es-
sentials from accidents overcomes Amer-
ican tendencies to dilettanteism, we
shall no doubt have a rich harvest of
scientific truth.
	Hitherto the subject has labored un-
der some fundamental misconceptions as
to its scope and province,  misconcep-
tions that are for the most part popular,
but yet not without their effect upon
university teaching. The chief of these
is the one that English historical gram-
mar is the same thing as the history of
the English language. This niistaken
assumption underlies most of the at-
tempts to teach the subject that have yet
been made. It is an easy mistake to
make, for the only difference between a
complete history of the English language
and a perfect English historical grammar
would be one of arrangement of material
and the point of view from which it was
considered. The one would be a chro-
nological account of the development of
language from the standpoint of modern
English, considering modern English as
the apex of the development; the other
would be a scientific treatment of the
phenomena themselves, considering the
present state of the language as an inci-
dental stage of the development. The
two are by no means the same. In the
point of view there lies a fundamental
distinction, and one that is frequently
overlooked. There is a still greater
distinction between the two when one
comes to study this history and this gram-
mar. To memorize a correct account of
the history of the English language is
not by any means the same thing as to
study English h~storicnl grammar. In
the latter work we deal with the phe-
noniena themselves, not with a general
statement of their relation. This dis-
tinction is now quite clear for biological
science. The study of biology is not
that of the history of the development
of physical life, though a complete his-
tory of biological phenomena might well
be one of the ends of biological science.
Supposing the links were all clear, a
mere account of the development of the
primordial cell through the various
stages of its life up to man would not
be biology, though an intelligent appre-
ciation of the phenomena does depend
upon a perception of their historical sig-
nificance, so to speak. And it is pre-
cisely so with English historical gram-
mar. The scientific study of the sub-
ject means far more than a description
of the sequence of its phenomena. It
means the discovery of their relation;</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00112" SEQ="0112" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="106">	106	English Historical arammar.
their classification according to real and
essential differences, not accidental ones;
the causes that have produced them, as
far as it is possible to ascertain their
causes; the laws which govern their de-
velopment; their relation to the forms of
English thinking; their relation to simi-
lar phenomena of other languages. Their
nature, their causes, their tendencies, all
these enter into a scientific conception
of the province of historical grammar.
The field the subject thus presents to
the student is in its way as wide as that
presented by biology, and if intelligently
worked would yield ~s rich a fruitage as
the study of biology has. In one sense
the history of the English language is
but the introductory chapter to all this.
To substitute the one for the other is
like offering a superficial Fourteen
Weeks in Philosophy for an adequate
course in elementary physics. Such a
substitute may possibly be better than
nothing, but it is very little better, and
it stands in the way of the student ever
getting anything like a firm grasp of the
matter.
	Another misconception of the nature
and province of historical grammar is
due to the fact that any thorough study
of spoken English is confused in the
popular mind with the study of phonet-
ics- Students are taught in elementary
schools that certain letters have certain
sounds, and they are then taught to re-
produce these sounds, when acted upon
by the stimulus of certain diacritical
marks: pronounce long ~ as in make,
pronounce short ~ as in fat. Phonet-
ics thus gets to be a matter of pronoun- words was not historical, but merely de-
cing written forms of expression; so that I voted itself to the discovery of easily

their children pronounce the letters, in are capable of such reduction. Though
the fear that they may fall into the habit
of speaking English in a vulgar fashion
if they do not take pains. In this sense
the phonetics of English is an absurdity.
It considers the written language as the
norm, and seeks to explain the spoken
form as a capricious deviation from the
written type. The truth is the converse
of this. A has not the sound of a in
father, and of a in late, and of a in
bat, etc., but the a in father, and the a
in late, and the a in bat, and the others
are entirely different and distinct sounds,
which happen, all of them, to be repre-
sented by the same sign, namely a. The
abnormality is in the writing: the study
of these abnormalities ought properly to
be called graphics, not phonetics.
Of course, in its scientific aspect, accord-
ing to which phonetics is the study of
the physiological formation of the sounds
used in language, the subject is part of a
thorough study of historical grammar,
but only a minor part.
	Similarly, etymology plays a great part
in the notion many people have of the
scientific study of English. English is
thought to be a conglomerate of various
other languages, made up of words de-
rived from Latin, or Greek, or French, or
German. To be aware of the meaning
these words had in the original speech
from which they were derived was a
euphuistic accomplishment that gave
much pleasure a few generations ago,
and the display of such knowledge is
still thought to be one of the ornaments
of writing. The etymology which had
for its concern the elucidation of these</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00113" SEQ="0113" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="107">	English Historical Grammar.	107

they occupy a large space in dictionaries
of English, such words do not play an
important part in its history. A student
might know perfectly the etyma of
all of them, and yet be quite ignorant of
English itself. They are for the most
part mere additions to the vocabulary of
English. It is a general principle of
English grammar that borrowed words,
from the time they are taken into the
language, are treated as if they were
English, obeying the same laws of de-
velopment as the native words. A sepa-
rate treatment in grammar is not neces-
sary for them. To consider the separate
stlidy of such words as an integral part
of English grammar is to follow the me-
diieval method of the study of Latin.
	Nor is English historical grammar
what is popularly known as English phi-
lology. This word philology has
been given such a variety of meanings,
ranging all the way from the encyclop~-
die German notion of the study of every-
thing remotely or directly concerned with
language and literature, to the popular
English and American one of the dilet-
tante study of words, that it has become
well-nigh useless for scientific purposes.
In the popular sense, however, it has lit-
tle to do with historical grammar, 
not much more than etymology has. It
bears much the same relation to it that
collecting butterflies bears to entomolo-
gy, or collecting fossils to geology. Yet
the study of words, generally from
Archbishop Trenchs book bearing that
title, has long been one of the most
common substitutes for English histori-
cal grammar in our schools and univer-
sities. It can be made comparatively
interesting, because it calls attention to
peculiar developments of word-meanings
and unexpected associations of ideas.
But it has little educational value. It
only develops a petty attention to details
without knowledge of their significance,
and produces in the student the idea that
he has exhausted the subject.
	Rid of these misconceptions, we have
in English historical grammar a sub-
ject that is scientific, practical, and of
great educational value, and, moreover,
a subject which can be taught in an ele-
mentary way to young students, and can
at the same time furnish a field for ori-
ginal scientific work in university teach-
ing. Why should it not be easily possi-
ble to put it in the place that dogmatic
grammar used to occupy? Why is it
necessary to wait until a student is near-
ly through with a university course to
give him a scientific knowledge of the
machinery he thinks with? It would not
be difficult to teach any boy to read Old
English at the time when he begins to
read Latin, to continue the work by
teaching him to read Middle English,
and then to put upon this elementary
work, which need only be such as will
give him the power roughly to read his
own language in any period of its his-
tory, a more or less thorough training in
English historical grammar. It is not
necessary to make him speak Old Eng-
lish or Middle English, or even to seek
native idioms in his own use of language.
But surely a student with an accurate
and correct knowledge of what his lan-
guage is will be able to use it with more
ease and power than one without such
knowledge.
	We need not expect this sort of train-
ing to make us think more clearly and
write better than our clearest thiakers
and best writers do now; but we can
expect it to give this power to more men
and women than possess it now; we
can expect to get from English histori-
cal grammar the basis for a sane and
practical didactic grammar which will
represent to the student the real nature
of his language, and will enable him to
see more clearly what good English
is and teach him how to use it; we can
expect it to illuminate and quicken into
a newer life for us the best of our Eng-
lish literature.

WHAT do you sell, John Camplejolin,
In Bay Street by the sea?
Oh, turtle shell is what I sell,
In great variety:

Trinkets and combs and rosaries,
All keepsakes from the sea;
T is choose and buy what takes the eye,
In such a treasury.

T is none of these, John Camplejohn,
Though curious they be,
But something more I m looking for,
In Bay Street by the sea.

Where can I buy the magic charm
Of the Bahaman sea,
That fills mankind with peace of mind
And souls felicity?

Now what do you sell, John Camplejohn,
In Bay Street by the sea,
Tinged with that true and native blue
Of lapis lazuli?

Look from your door, and tell me now
The color of the sea.
Where can I buy that wondrous dye,
And take it home with me?

And where can I buy that rustling sound,
In this city by the sea,
Of the plumy palms in their high blue calms;
Or the stately poise and free

Of the bearers who go up and down,
Silent as mystery,
Burden on head, with naked tread,
In the white streets by the sea?

And where can I buy, John Camplejohn,
In Bay Street by the sea,
The sunlights fall on the old pink wall,
Or the gold of the orange tree?</PB>

Ah, that is more than I ye heard tell
In Bay Street by the sea,
Since I began, my roving man,
A trafficker to be.

As sure as I m John Camplejohn,
And Bay Street s by the sea,
Those things for gold have not been sold,
Within my memory.

But what would you give, my roving man
From countries oversea,
For the things you name, the life of the same,
And the power to bid them be?

I d give my hand, John Camplejohn,
In Bay Street by the sea,
For the smallest dower of that dear power
To paint the things I see.

My roving man, I never heard,
On any land or sea
Under the sun, of any one
Could sell that power to thee.

T is sorry news, John Camplejohn,
If this be destiny,
That every mart should know that art,
Yet none can sell it me.

But look you, here s the grace of God:
There s neither price nor fee,
Duty nor toll, that can control
The power to love and see.

To each his luck, John Camplejohn, 
No less! And as for me,
Give me the pay of an idle day
In Bay Street by the sea.

	WITH the exception of a tedious delay
at East Radford it was a very enjoyable

Bridge, through a country everywhere
interesting, and for much of the distance
gloriously wild and beautiful. Splendid

tance from its mouth,  almost as wide,
I thought, as the Tennessee at Chat-

high, 100 feet wide, and 90 feet in span,
crossing the ravine of Cedar Brook.
Magnificent as it is, there is, for me at
least, not much to say concerning it, or
concerning my sensations in the presence
of it. iNot that it disappointed me. On
the contrary, it was from the first more
imposing than I had expected to find it.
I loved to look at it, from one side and
from the other, from beneath and from
above. I walked under it and over it
(on the public highway, for it is a bridge
not only in name. but in fact) many
times, by sunlight and by moonlight,
and should be glad to do the same many
times more; but perhaps my taste is
peculiar; at all events, such wonders
of nature do not charm me or wear
with me like a beautiful landscape. It
was so, I remember, at Ausable Chasm;
interesting, grand, impressive, but a
place in which I had no passion for stay-
ing, no sense of exquisite delight or
solemnity. In Burlington, just across
Lake Champlain, I could sit by the hour,
even on the fiat roof of the hotel, and
gaze upon the blue water and the blue
Adirondacks beyond,  the sight was a
feast of beauty; but this cleft in the
rocks,  well, I was glad to walk through
it and to shoot the rapids; there was
nothing to be said in disparagement of
the place, but it put me under no spell.
I fear it would be the same with those
marvelous Colorado caiThns and gar-
dens of the gods. A wooded moun-
tain side, a green valley, running water,
a lake with islands, best of all, perhaps
(for mc, that is, and taking the years
together), a New England hill pasture,
with boulders and red cedars, berry
bushes and fern patches, the whole
bounded by stone walls and bordered
with gray birches and pitch pines,  for
sights to live with, let me have these and
things like them in preference to any of
natures more freakish work, which ap-
peals rather to curiosity than to the im-
agination and the affections.
Having gone under the arch (and
	VOL. LXXXII.  NO. 489.	8
looked in vain for Washingtons initials
on the wall), the visitor to Natural Bridge
finds himself following up the brook
a lively stream  between lofty precip-
itous cliffs, that turn to steep wooded
slopes as he proceeds. If he is like me,
he pursues the path to the end, stopping
here and there,  at the saltpetre cave,
at Hemlock Island, and at Lost River, if
nowhere else,  till he comes to the end
at the falls, a distance of a mile, more or
less. That is my way always. I must
go straight through the place once; then,
the edge of my curiosity dulled, I am in
a condition to see and enjoy.
	The ravine is a botanists paradise: that,
I should say, must be the first thought
of every appreciative tourist. The eleva-
tion (fifteen hundred feet), the latitude,
and the limestone rocks work together
to that end. In a stay of a week I could
see, of course, but one set of flowers;
and in my preoccupation I passed many
herbs and shrubs, mostly out of bloom,
the names of which I neither knew nor
attempted to discover. One of the things
that struck my admiration on the instant
was the beauty of the columbine as here
displayed; a favorite with me always,
for more reasons than one, but never be-
held in all its loveliness till now. If the
election could be held here, and on the
1st of May, there would be no great diffi-
culty in securing a unanimous vote for
Aquilegia Canadensis as the national
flower. It was in its glory at the time
of my earlier visits, brightening the face
of the cliffs, not in a mass, but in scat-
tered sprays, as high as the eyesight
could follow it; looking, even under the
opera-glass, as if it grew out of the rock
itself. With it were sedges, ferns, and
much of a tufted white flower, which at
first I made no question must be the
common early saxifrage. When I came
upon it within reach, however, I saw at
once that it was a plant of quite another
sort, some member of the troublesome
mustard family,  Draba ramosissima,
as afterward turned out. It was wonder-</PB>

ful how closely it simulated the appear-
ance of Saxifraga Virginiensis, though
the illusion was helped, no doubt, by the
habit I ani in of seeing columbine and
saxifrage together.
	The ground in many places was al-
most a mat of violets, three kinds of
which were in special profusion: the tall,
fragrant white Canadensis, the long-
spurred rostrata,  of a very pale blue,
with darker streaks and a darker centre
(like our blue meadow violets in that re-
spect),  and the commonpalmata. The
long-spurred violet was new to me, and
both for that reason and for itself pe-
culiarly attractive. As I passed up the
glen on the right of the brook beyond
Hemlock Island, so called, carpeted with
partridge-berry vines bearing a wondrous
crop ( See the berries!  my notebook
says), I began to find here and there the
large trillium (T grand~/1oram), some
of the blossoms clear white, others of a
delicate rosy tint. The rosy ones had
been open longer than the others, it ap-
peared; for the flowers blush with age,
 a very modest and grac~ful habit.
Like the spurred violet, the trillium is a
plant also of northern New England, but
happily for my present enjoyment I had
never seen it there. And the same is
to be said of the large yellow bellwort,
which was here the trilliums neighbor,
and looked only a little less distinguished
than the trillium itself.
	If I were to name all the plants I saw,
or even all that attracted my particular
notice, the non-botanical reader would
quit me for a tiresome chronicler. ilepa-
tica and bloodroot had dropped their last
petals; but anemone and rue anemone
were still in bloom, with cranesbill,
spring beauty, ragwort, mitrewort, rob-
ins plantain, Jack - in - the - pulpit, wild
ginger (two thick handsome leaves hid-
ing a dark-purplish three-horned urn of
an occult and almost sinister aspect),
two or more showy chickweeds, two
kinds of white stone-crop (Sedurn~ ter-
natum, and S. Nevii, the latter a novel-
ty), mandrake (sheltering its precious
round bud under an umbrella, though
to-day it neither rained nor shone), pep-
per-root, gill-over-the-ground (where did
it come from, I wondered), Dutchmans
breeches (the leaves only), Orchis specta-
bilis (which I did not know till after a
few days it blossomed), and many more.
A new shrub  almost a tree  was the
bladder-nut, with drooping clusters of
small whitish flowers, like bunches of
currant blossoms in their manner of
growth and general appearance; espe-
cially dear to humble-bees, which would
not be done with a branch even while
I carried it in my hand. In one place,
as I stooped to examine a boulder cov-
ered thickly with the tiny walking fern,
of which the ravine contains a great
abundance,  faded, ill conditioned, and
homely, but curious, and, better still, a
stranger,  I found the ground littered
with bright yellowish magnolia petals;
and if I looked into the sky for a pass-
ing bird, it was almost as likely as not
that I should find myself looking through
the branches of a soaring tulip-tree,  a
piece of magnificence that is one of the
most constant of my Alleghanian admi-
rations. All the upper part of the glen
is pervaded by a dull rumbling or moan-
ing sound,  the voice of Lost River, out
of which the tourist is supposed to have
drunk at the only point where it shows
itself (and there only to those who look
for it), a quarter of a mile back. An-
other all-pervasive thing is the whole-
some fragrance of arbor-vitte. It is fit-
ting, surely, that the tree of life should
be growing in this floral paradise. There
are few places, I imagine, where it flour-
ishes better.
	On my way back toward the bridge I
discovered, as was to be expected, many
things that had been overlooked on my
way out; and every successive visit was
similarly rewarded. A pleasing sight at
the bridge itself was the continual flut-
tering of butterflies  Turnus and his
smaller and paler brother Ajax, espe</PB>

daily  against the face of the cliffs,
sipping from the deep honey-jars of the
columbines. Here, too, I often stopped
awhile to enjoy the doings of several
pairs of rough-winged swallows that had
their nests in a row of holes in the rock,
between two of the strata. Most ro-
mantic homes they looked, under the
overhanging ledge,  a narrow platform
below, ferns and sedges nodding over-
head, with tall arbor-vita~ trees a little
higher on the cliff, and water dropping
continually before the doors. One of the
nests, I noticed, had directly in front of
it a patch of low green moss, the neat-
est of door-mats. The holes were only a
few feet above the level of the stream,
but there was no approach to them with-
out wading; for which reason, perhaps,
the owners paid little attention to me,
even when I got as near them as I could.
In and out they went, quite at their
ease, resting now and then upon a jut-
ting shelf, or perching in the branches
of some tree near at hand. Once three
of them sat side by side before one of
the openings, which after all may have
admitted to some sizable cavern where-
in different pairs were living together.
They are the least beautiful of swallows,
but for this time, at all events, they had
displayed a remarkably pretty taste in
the choice of a nesting-site.
	The birds of Cedar Creek, however,
were not the rough-wings, but the Loui-
siana water thrushes. On my first jaunt
through the ravine (May 1) I counted
seven of them, here one and there an-
other, the greater part in free song; and
while I never found so many again at
any one visit, I was never there without
seeing and hearing at least two or three.
It was exactly such a spot as the water
thrush loves,  a quick stream, with boul-
ders and abundant vegetation. The song,
I am sorry to be obliged to confess, as I
have confessed before, is not to me all
that it appears to be to other listeners;
probably not all that a longer acquaint-
ance and a more intimate association
would make it. It is loud and ringing,
 for a warblers song, I mean; in that
respect well adapted to the birds or-
dinary surroundings, being easily heard
above the noise of a pretty lively brook.
It is heard the better, too, because of its
remarkably disconnected, staccato char-
acter. Every note is by itself. Though
the bird haunts the vicinity of running
water, there is no trace of fluidity in its
utterance. No bird-song could be less
flowing. It neither gurgles nor runs
smoothly, note merging into note. It
would be too much to call it declama-
tory, perhaps, but it goes some way in
that direction. At least we may call it
emphatic. At different times I wrote it
down in different words, none of which
could be expected to do more than as-
sist, first the writers memory, and then
the readers imagination, to recall and
divine the rhythm and general form of
the melody. For that  I speak for
myself  a verbal transcription, imper-
fect as it must be, in the nature of the
case, is likely to prove more intelligible,
and therefore more useful, than any at-
tempt to reproduce the music itself by a
resort to musical notation. As most fre-
quently heard here, the song consisted
of eight notes, like Come  come 
come  come,  you re a beauty, de-
livered rather slowly. Lazily was
the word I sometimes employed, but
slowly is perhaps better, though it
is true that the song is cool and, so to
speak, very unpassionate. Dynamically
I marked it ~ while the variations
in pitch may be indicated roughly thus:
	  .	Two of the lower notes,
the fifth and sixth, were shorter than the
others,  half as long, if my ear and
memory are to be trusted. Sometimes a
bird would break out into a bit of flour-
ish at the end, but to my thinking such
improvised cadenzas, as they had every
appearance of being, only detracted from
the simplicity of the strain without add-
ing anything appreciable to its beauty or
its effectiveness.</PB>

	This song, which the reader will per-
haps blame me for trying thus to analyze
(I shall not blame him), very soon grew
to be almost a part of the glen; so that
I never recall the brook and the cliffs
without seeming to hear it rising clear
and sweet above the brawling of the
current; and when I hear it, I can see
the birds flitting up or down the creek,
just in advance of me, with sharp chips
of alarm or displeasure; now balancing
uneasily on a boulder in mid-stream (a
posterior bodily fluctuation, half graceful,
half comical, slanderously spoken of as
teetering) and singing a measure or two,
now taking to an overhanging branch,
sometimes at a considerable height, for
the same tuneful purpose. One acrobatic
fellow, I remember, walked for some dis-
tance along the seemingly perpendicular
face of the cliff, slipping now and then
on the wet surface and having to  wing
it fora space, yet still pausing at short
intervals to let out a song. In truth,
the happy creatures were just then brim-
ming over with music; and if I seem to
praise their efforts but grudgingly, it is
to be said, on the other hand, in justice
to the song and to myself, that my ap-
preciation of it grew as the days passed.
Whatever else might be true of it, it
was the voice of the place.
	Of birds beside the rough-wings and
the water thrushes there were surpris-
ingly few in the glen, though, to be sure,
there may well have been many more
than I found trace of. The splashing of
a mountain brook is very pleasing music,
 more pleasing, in itself considered,
than the great majority of bird-songs,
perhaps,  but an ornithological hobby-
ist may easily have too much of it. I
call to mind how increasingly vexatious,
and at last all but intolerable, a turbu-
lent Vermont stream (a branch of Waits
River) became to me, some years ago, as
it followed my road persistently mile af-
ter mile in the course of a May vacation.
One gets on the track of the smaller
birds through hearing their faint calls
in the bushes and treetops; and how
was I to catch such indispensable signals
with this everlasting uproar in my eai~s?
So it was here in Cedar Creek ravine;
it would have to be a pretty loud voice
to be heard above the din of the hurry-
ing water. And the birds, on their side,
had something of the same difficulty; or
so I judged from the unconventional be-
havior of a blue yellow-backed warbler
that flitted through the hanging branches
of a tree within a few inches of my hat,
having plainly no suspicion of a human
beings proximity. The tufted titmouse
could be heard, of course. He would
make a first-rate auctioneer, it seemed
to me, with his penetrating, indefatiga-
ble voice and his genius for repetition.
Now and then, too, I caught the sharp,
sermonizing tones of a red-eyed vireo.
Once an oven-bird near me mounted a
tree hastily, branch by branch, and threw
himself from the top for a burst of his
afternoon medley; and at the bridge a
pho3be sat calling. These, with a pair of
cardinal grosbeaks, were all the birds I
saw in the glen during my first days
visit.
	In fact, I had the place pretty nearly
to myself, not only on this first day, but
for the entire week. Once in a great
while a human visitor was encountered,
but for the most part I went up and
down the path with no disturbance to
my meditations. Happily for me, the
Bridge was now in its dull season. Many
tourists had been here. The trunks of
the older trees, the beeches especially,
were scarred thickly with inglorious ini-
tials, some of them so far from the ground
that the authors of them must have stood
on one anothers shoulders in their de-
termination to get above the crowd. (In
work of this kind an inch or two makes
all the difference between renown and
obscurity.) The fact was emblematic, I
thought. So do men hoist and boost
themselves into fame, not only in Cedar
Creek ravine, but in the great world,
as we call it, outside. Who so lowly-</PB>

minded as not to believe that he could
make a name for himself if only he had
a step-ladder? At the arch, likewise,
such autographers had been busy ever
since Washingtons day. I peeped into
a crevice to obtain a closer view of a
tiny fern, and there before me was a
penciled name, invisible till I came thus
near to it. One of the meek the writer
must have been; a lead pencil, and so
fine a hand! Dumphy of New Orleans.
Why should I not second his modest bid
for immortality? A good name is rather
to be chosen than great riches. By all
means let Dumphy of New Orleans be
remembered.
	As for Washingtons G. W., the
letters are said to be still decipherable
by those who know exactly where to look
and exactly what to look for; but I can
testify to nothing of myself. I was told
where the initials were; one was much
plainer than the other, my informant
said,  which seemed to imply that one
of them, at least, was more or less a
matter of faith; he would go down with
me some day and point them out; but
the hour convenient to both of us never
came, and so, although I almost always
spent a minute or two in the search as
I passed under the arch, I never detect-
ed them or anything that I could even
imagine to stand for them. I have had
experience enough of such things, how-
ever, to be aware that my failure proves
nothing as against the witness of other
mens eyesight. Certainly I know of no
ground for doubting that Washington
cut his initials on the cliff; and if he
did, it seems reasonable to believe that
tradition would have preserved a know-
ledge of the place, and so have made it
possible to find them now in all their
inevitable indistinctness after so long an
exposure to the wear of the elements.
Neither do I esteem it anything but a
natural and worthy curiosity for the vis-
itor to wish to see them; and I may add
my hope that all young men who are
destined to achieve Washingtons mea
sure of distinction will cut their names
large and deep in every such wall, for
the benefit of future generations. As
for the rest of us, if we must scratch
our names in stone or carve them on
the bark of trees, let us seek some se-
questered nook, where the sight of our
doings will neither be an offense to oth-
ers nor make us a laughing-stock.
	I have said that I discovered Dumphy
of New Orleans while leaning against
the cliff to peer into a crevice in search
of a diminutive fern. This fern was of
much interest to me, being nothing less
than the wall-rue spleenwort (Asplenium
Ruta-muraria), for which I had looked
without success in years past on the lime-
stone cliffs of northern Vermont, at
Willoughby and elsewhere. The fronds,
stipe and all, last - year plants in full
fruit, were less than three inches in length.
Another fern, one size larger, but equal-
ly new and interesting, was the purple-
stemmed cliff-brake (Pellcea atropurpu-
rea), which also had eluded my search
in its New England habitat. Both these
rarities (plants which will grow only on
limestone cannot easily be degraded into
commonness) I could have gathered here
in moderate numbers, but of course col-
lecting is not permitted; it cannot be, in
a spot so frequented by curiosity-seekers-
It was pleasure enough for me, at any
rate, to see them.
	Along the bottom of the ravine I had
remarked a profusion of a strikingly
beautiful larger fern (but still small-
ish, as my pencil says), with showy red
stems and a most graceful curving or
drooping habit. This I could not make
out for a time; but it proved to be, as
I soon began to suspect, Cystopteris but-
bifera, to my thinking one of the loveli-
est of all things that grow. I had seen
it abundant at Willoughby, Vermont,
and at Owls Head, Canada, ten years
before; but either my memory was play-
ing me a trick, or there was here a very
considerable diminution in the length of
the fronds, accompanied by a decided</PB>

heightening in the color of the stalk and
rhachis. Before long, however, I found
a specimen aheady beginning to show its
bulbiets, and these, with a study of Dr.
Eatons description, left me in no doubt
as to the plants identity.
	What other ferns may have been grow-
ing in the ravine I cannot now pretend
to say. I remember the Christmas fern,
a goodly supply of the dainty little As-
plenium triehomanes, and tufts of what
I took with reasonable certainty for Cys-
topteris fragilis in its early spring stage,
than which few things can be more
graceful. On the upper edge of the
ravine, when I left the place one day
by following a maze of zigzag cattle-
paths up the steep slope, and found my-
self, to my surprise, directly in the rear
of the hotel, I came upon a dense patch
of a smallish, very narrow, dark-stemmed
fern, new to my eyes,  the hairy lip-
fern, so called (Cheilanthes vest ita).
These fronds, too, like those of the cliff-
brake and the wall-rue spleenwort, were
of last years growth, thickly covered
on the back with brown fruit-dots,
and altogether having much the appear-
ance of dry herbarium specimens; but
they were good to look at, nevertheless.
Here, as in the case of Pelhea atropur-
purea, it was a question not only of a
new species, but of a new genus.
	From my account of the scarcity of
birds in Cedar Creek ravine the reader
will have already inferred, perhaps, that
I did not spend my days there, great as
were its botanical attractions. My last
mornings experience at Pulaski, the
evidence there seen that the vernal mi-
gration was at full tide, or near it, had
brought on a pretty acute attack of
ornithological fever, ~ a spring disease
which I am happy to believe has become
almost an epidemic in some parts of the
United States within recent years, 
and not even the sight of new ferns and
new flowers could allay its symptoms. I
had counted upon finding a similar state
of things here,  all the woods astir with
wings. Instead of that, I found the
fields alive with chipping sparrows, the
air full of chimney swifts, the shade
trees in front of the hotel vocal with gold-
finch notes, and, comparatively speaking,
nothing else. By the end of the sec-
ond day I was fast becoming disconso-
late. No birds here, I wrote in my
journal. I have tried woods of all sorts.
A very few parula warblers, two or three
red - eyed vireos, one yellow - throated
vireo, seven Louisiana water thrushes in
the glen, one prairie warbler, and a few
oven-birds! No Bewick wrens. Two
purple finches and one or two phwbes
have been the only additions to my Vir-
ginia list. A pitiful tale. Vacations
are short and precious, and it goes hard
with us to see them running to waste.
	The next evening (May 3) it was the
same story continued. It is marvelous,
the difference between this beautiful
place, diversified with fields and woods,
 hard wood, cedar, pine,  it is mar-
velous, the difference between this hea-
venly spot and Pulaski in the matter of
birds. There I registered six new ar-
rivals in half an hour Wednesday morn-
ing; here I have made but six additions
to my list in two full days. There is
scarcely a sign of warbler migration.
Was it that in Pulaski the woods were
comparatively small, and the birds had
to congregate in them? Or does Pulaski
lie in a route of migration? Wild sur-
Inises, both of them; but wisdom is not
to be looked for in a fever patient.
	Six additions in two full days, I
wrote; but the second day was not yet
full. As evening came on I went out to
stand awhile upon the bridge; and while
I listened to the brawling of the creek
and admired the beautiful scene below
me, the moon shining straight down upon
it, a nighthawk called from the sky, and
afterward  not from the sky  a whip-
poorwill. Here, then, were two more
names for my catalogue; but even so,
 six or eight,  it was a beggarly rate
of increase in such a favored spot and</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00125" SEQ="0125" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="119">	At Natural Bridge, Virginia.	119

in the very nick of the season. The
six additions, it may ease the read-
ers curiosity to know, were the Carolina
wren, the summer tanager, the purple
finch, the indigo bunting, the blue-gray
gnatcatcher, and the phwbe.
	One compensation there was for the
ornithological barrenness of these first
few days: I had the more leisure for
botany. And the hours were not thrown
away, although at the time I was almost
ready to think they were, with so many
of them devoted to ransacking the Man-
ual; for a man who does not collect spe-
cimens to carry home with him must, as
it were, drive his field work and his closet
work abreast; he must study out his find-
ings as he goes along. On the evening
of the second day, for example, I wrote in
my journal thus,  the final entry under
that date, as the reader may guess: In
bed. Strange how we flatter ourselves
with a knowledge of names. I have
spent much time to-day looking up the
names of flowers and ferns, and somehow
feel as if I had learned something in so
doing. Really, however, I have learned
only that some one else has seen the things
before me, and called them so and so.
At best that is nearly all I have learned.
But after setting down the results of my
investigations, especially of those having
to do with the pretty draba and the bul-
biferous fern, I concluded in a less posi-
tive strain: Well, the hunt for names
does quicken observation and help to re-
late and classify things. That was a
qualification well put in. The whole
truth was never written on one side of
the leaf. If all our botany were Latin
names, as Emerson says, we should have
little to boast of; yet even that would
be one degree better than nothing, as
Emerson himself felt when he visited a
museum and saw the cases of shells. I
was hungry for names, he remarks. So
have all men of intelligence been since
the day of the first systematic, name-
conferring naturalist, the man who dwelt
in Eden. Let us be thankful for man-
nals, I say, that offer on easy terms a
speaking acquaintance, if nothing more,
with the world of beauty about us.
Things take their value from compari-
son, and my own ignorance was but a
little while ago so absolute that now I
am proud to know so much as a name.
	Meanwhile, to come back to Natural
Bridge, I had found the country of a
most engaging sort. In truth, while the
bridge itself is the feature of the
place, as we speak in these days, it is by
no means its only, or, as I should say,
its principal attraction, so far, at least,
as a leisurely visit is concerned. A man
may see it and go,  as most tourists
do; but if he stays, he will find that the
region round about not only has charms
of its own, but is one of the prettiest he
has ever set eyes on; and that, I should
think, though he be neither a botanist,
nor an ornithologist, nor any other kind
of natural historian. For myself, at all
events, I had already come to that con-
clusion, notwithstanding I had yet to see
some of the most beautiful parts of the
country, and was, besides, far too much
concerned about the birds (the absentees
in particular) and the flowers to have
quieted down to any adequate apprecia-
tion of the general landscape. I have
never yet learned to see a prospect on
the first day, or while in the eager ex-
pectation of new things, although, like
every one else, I can exclaim with a mea-
sure of shallow sincerity, Beautiful!
beautiful! even at the first moment.
	As my mood now was, at any rate,
fine scenery did not satisfy me; and on
the morning of May 4, after two days
and a half of botanical surfeit and or-
nithological starvation, I packed my
trunk preparatory to going elsewhere.
First, however, I would try the woods
once more, if perchance something might
have happened overnight. Otherwise,
so I informed the landlord, I would re-
turn in season for an early luncheon, and
should expect to be driven to tIme station
for the noon train northward.</PB>

	I went to a promising-looking hill cov-
ered with hard-wood forest, a spot al-
ready visited more than once,  Buck
Hill I heard it called afterward,  and
was no sooner well in the woods than
it became evident that something had
happened. The treetops were swarming
with birds, and I had my hands full
with trying to see and name them. Old
trees are grand creations,  among the
noblest works of God, I often think; but
for a bird-gazer they have one disheart-
ening drawback, especially when, as now,
the birds not only take to the topmost
boughs (even the hummer and the mag-
nolia warbler, so my notes say, went with
the multitude to do evil), but, to make
matters worse, are on the move north-
ward or southward, or flitting in simple
restlessness from hill to hill. However,
I did my best with them while the fun
lasted. Then all in a moment they were
gone, though I did not see them go; and
nothing was left but the wearisome iter-
ations of oven-birds and red-eyes where
just now were so many singers and talk-
ers, among which, for aught I could tell,
there might have been some that it would
have been worth the price of a long va-
cation to scrape even a treetop acquaint-
ance with.
	Indeed, it was certain that one mem-
ber of the flock was a rarity, if not an
absolute novelty. That was the most
exciting and by all odds the most de-
plorable incident of the whole affair. I
had obtained several glimpses of him,
but had been unable to determine his
identity; a warbler, past all reasonable
doubt, with pure white under parts (the
upper parts quite invisible) except for a
black or blackish line, barely made out,
across the lower throat or the upper
breast. He, of course, had vanished
with the rest, the more was the pity. I
had made a guess at him, to be sure;
it is a poor naturalist who cannot do as
much as that (but a really good natural-
ist would form a hypothesis, I sup-
pose) under almost any circumstances.
I had called him a cerulean warbler.
Once in my life I had seen a bird of
that species, but only for a minute. If
he wore a black breast-band, I did not
see it, or else had forgotten it. If I
could only have had a look at this fel-
lows back and wings! As it was, I was
not likely ever to know him, though the
printed description would either demol-
ish or add a degree of plausibility to my
offhand conjecture.
	The better course, after losing a bevy
of wanderers in this way, is perhaps to
remain where one is and await the arrival
of another detachment of the migratory
host. This advice, or something like it,
I seem to remember having read, at all
events; but I have never schooled myself
to such a pitch of quietism. For a time,
indeed, I could not believe that the birds
were lost, and must hunt the hilltop over
in the hope of another chance at them.
An empty hope. So I did what I al-
ways do: the game having flown, I took
my own departure also. I should not
find the same flock again, but with good
luck  which now it was easy to expect
	I might find another; and except
for the single mysterious stranger, that
would be better still. One thing I was
sure of,  Natural Bridge was not to be
left out of the warbler migration; and
one thing I forgot entirely,  that I had
planned to leave it by the noonday train.
	My useless chase over the broad hill-
top had brought me to the side opposite
the one by which I had ascended, and
to save time, as I persuaded myself, I
plunged down, as best I could, without
a trail,  a piece of expensive economy,
almost of course. In the first place, this
haphazardous descent took me longer
than it would have done to retrace my
steps; and in the second place, I was
compelled for much of the distance to
force my way through troublesome un-
derbrush, in doing which I made of ne-
cessity  being a white man  no little
noise, and so was the less likely to hear
the note of any small bird, or to come</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00127" SEQ="0127" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="121">	At Natural Bridge, Virginia.	121

close upon him without putting him to
flight. In general, let the bird - gazer
keep to the path, except in open woods,
or as some specific errand may lead him
away from it. In one way and another,
nevertheless, I got down at last, and after
beating over a piece of pine wood, with
little or no result, I crossed a field and a
road, and entered a second tract of hard-
wood forest.
	The trees were comfortably low, with
much convenient shrubbery, and after a
little, seeing myself at the centre of
things, as it were, I dropped into a seat
and allowed the birds to gather about
me. At my back was a bunch of white-
throated sparrows. From the same
quarter a chat whistled now and then,
and white - breasted nuthatchcs and a
Carolina chickadee did likewise, the last
with a noticeable variation in his tune,
which had dwindled to three notes.
Here, as on the hill I had just left,
wood pewees and Acadian flycatchers
announced themselves, in tones so dis-
similar as to suggest no hint of blood
relationship. The wood pewee is surely
the gentleman of the family, so far as
the voice may serve as an indication of
character. In dress and personal ap-
pearance he is a flycatcher of the fly-
catchers; but what a contrast between
his soft, plaintive, exquisitely modulated
whistle, the very expression of refine-
ment, and the wild, rasping, over - em-
phatic vociferations that characterize the
family in general! The more praise to
him. The Acadians seemed to have
come northward in a body. Nothing
had been seen or heard of them before,
but from this morning they abounded in
all directions. In a single night they
had taken possession of the woods.
Here was the first Canadian warbler of
the season, singing from a perch so Un-
commonly elevated (he is a lover of
bushy thickets rather than of trees) that
for a time it did not come to me who
he was,  so exceedingly earnest and
voluble. A black - throated blue war-
bler almost brushed my elbow. Red-
starts were never so splendid, I thought,
the white of the dogwood blossoms, now
in their prime, setting off the black and
orange of the birds in a most brilliant
manner, as was true also of the deep ver-
milion of the summer tanager. A Black-
burnian warbler, whose flame - colored
throat needs no setting but its own, had
fallen into a lyrical mood very unusual for
him, and sang almost continuously for at
least half an hour,  a poor little song
in a thin little voice, but full of pleasant
suggestions in every note. The first
Swainson thrush was present, with no
companion of his own kind, so far as
appeared. I prolonged my stay on pur-
pose to hear him sing, but was obliged to
content myself with the sight of him and
the sound of his sweet, quick whistle.
	All the while, as I watched one fa-
vorite another would come between us.
Once it was a humming-bird, a bit of
animate beauty that must always be at-
tended to; and once, when the place
had of a sudden fallen silent, and I had
taken out a book, I was startled by a
flash of white among the branches,  a
red-headed woodpecker, in superb color,
new for the year, and on all accounts
welcome. He remained for a time in
silence, and then in silence departed (he
had been almost too near me before he
knew it); but having gone, he began a
little way off to play the tree-frog for my
amusement. After him a hairy wood-
pecker made his appearance, with sharp,
peremptory signals, highly characteris-
tic; and then, from some point near by,
a rose-breasted grosbeaks hic was heard.
	It was high noon before I was done
with receiving (one of the prettiest
functions of the year, though none of
the newspapers got wind of it), and re-
turned to the hotel, where the landlord
smiled when I told him that some friends
of mine had arrived, and I should stay a
few days longer.

SOME NEW LETTERS BY LEIGH HUNT AND STEVENSON.

	ALEXANDER IRELAND is known to
most book-lovers chiefly as the compiler
of The Book-Lovers Enchiridion, but it
will perhaps be as the friend of some
of the greatest literary celebrities of his
day that he will longest be borne in re-
membrance. And that day was a long
one, for he was born in Edinburgh on
May 9, 1810, and died in Manchester on
December 7, 1895.
	Although he was not actively connect-
ed with journalism until 1846, when he
became business manager of the Man-
chester Examiner and Times, Mr. Ire-
land had been keenly interested in liter-
ature for many years, and as early as
1835 had made the acquaintance of
Emerson and Robert Chambers. The
history of his friendship with Emerson
he himself has given in his Memoir and
Recollections of Emerson (1892). For
nine years (183443) he was a constant
visitor at the home of Robert Chambers,
coining into contact there with many
interesting people. It was through Mr.
Ireland that Vestiges of Creation was
first published; and later, it was he who
divulged the secret of the authorship, as
he was the last survivor of the four to
whom it had been entrusted. It must
remain a matter for infinite regret that
he never put together his recollections of
the distinguished writers whom he had
known.
	It was on the occasion of a visit to
London, in the spring of 1838, that Mr.
Ireland made the acquaintance of Leigh
Hunt, introduced by Robert Chambers
in the first of	the following letters 
EDINBURGH, March 28, 1838.

	M~ DEAR SIR,  A. young friend of
mine, who often reads and converses upon
your works with me, and is, though in
business, capable of appreciating their
thought, fancy, and benevolence, is about
to visit London, and I have thought of
gratifying both him and myself by com-
missioning him to take this letter to you,
to inquire how you do, and to give you
my kind remembrances, and to bring
me from your own lips, if possible, some
intelligence regarding you. All I have
heard of you for some time is that you
conduct the Monthly Repository, which
is not to be seen in Scotland, or which,
at any rate, I have not seen since you
began to be connected with it. I should
like to know if Fortune is kinder to you
than she has been, and how your lambs
suck and ewes feed; how your young
people, I mean, are getting on. You and
the world have somehow been uncon-
formable strata, which surely there was
no need for; and as I think it owes you
something, I should like to learn that it
has begun to pay the debt. My friends
name is Ireland; he is the son of an
eminent Edinbro patriot, and an excel-
lent young man, setting aside all regard
to literary taste and philosophic princi-
ple. Next to Lamb, I believe you are
his favourite author, and you can sympa-
thize in the pleasure which a young man
of refined feelings, brought up in the
country, niust be disposed to experience
on being admitted to see, in very habit
as he lives, one of the objects of his
worship. If his good fortune and your
convenience unite to favour him with an
interview of a few minutes, it will make
me, as his friend, your grateful debtor.
	Trusting to hear all that is good of
you, and with sentiments of sincere re-
gard, I remain, my dear sir,
Yours ever faithfully,
ROBERT CHAMBERS.

SOME NEW LETTERS BY LEIGH HUNT AND STEVENSON.

	ALEXANDER IRELAND is known to
most book-lovers chiefly as the compiler
of The Book-Lovers Enchiridion, but it
will perhaps be as the friend of some
of the greatest literary celebrities of his
day that he will longest be borne in re-
membrance. And that day was a long
one, for he was born in Edinburgh on
May 9, 1810, and died in Manchester on
December 7, 1895.
	Although he was not actively connect-
ed with journalism until 1846, when he
became business manager of the Man-
chester Examiner and Times, Mr. Ire-
land had been keenly interested in liter-
ature for many years, and as early as
1835 had made the acquaintance of
Emerson and Robert Chambers. The
history of his friendship with Emerson
he himself has given in his Memoir and
Recollections of Emerson (1892). For
nine years (183443) he was a constant
visitor at the home of Robert Chambers,
coining into contact there with many
interesting people. It was through Mr.
Ireland that Vestiges of Creation was
first published; and later, it was he who
divulged the secret of the authorship, as
he was the last survivor of the four to
whom it had been entrusted. It must
remain a matter for infinite regret that
he never put together his recollections of
the distinguished writers whom he had
known.
	It was on the occasion of a visit to
London, in the spring of 1838, that Mr.
Ireland made the acquaintance of Leigh
Hunt, introduced by Robert Chambers
in the first of	the following letters 
EDINBURGH, March 28, 1838.

	M~ DEAR SIR,  A. young friend of
mine, who often reads and converses upon
your works with me, and is, though in
business, capable of appreciating their
thought, fancy, and benevolence, is about
to visit London, and I have thought of
gratifying both him and myself by com-
missioning him to take this letter to you,
to inquire how you do, and to give you
my kind remembrances, and to bring
me from your own lips, if possible, some
intelligence regarding you. All I have
heard of you for some time is that you
conduct the Monthly Repository, which
is not to be seen in Scotland, or which,
at any rate, I have not seen since you
began to be connected with it. I should
like to know if Fortune is kinder to you
than she has been, and how your lambs
suck and ewes feed; how your young
people, I mean, are getting on. You and
the world have somehow been uncon-
formable strata, which surely there was
no need for; and as I think it owes you
something, I should like to learn that it
has begun to pay the debt. My friends
name is Ireland; he is the son of an
eminent Edinbro patriot, and an excel-
lent young man, setting aside all regard
to literary taste and philosophic princi-
ple. Next to Lamb, I believe you are
his favourite author, and you can sympa-
thize in the pleasure which a young man
of refined feelings, brought up in the
country, niust be disposed to experience
on being admitted to see, in very habit
as he lives, one of the objects of his
worship. If his good fortune and your
convenience unite to favour him with an
interview of a few minutes, it will make
me, as his friend, your grateful debtor.
	Trusting to hear all that is good of
you, and with sentiments of sincere re-
gard, I remain, my dear sir,
Yours ever faithfully,
ROBERT CHAMBERS.


ALEXANDiIE IRELAND TO LEIGH RUNT.

EDINBURGH, May 18, 1838.

	M~ DEAR Sin,  I beg your accept-
amice of the accompanying works, of</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00129" SEQ="0129" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="123">	Some New Letters by Leigh Hunt and Stevenson.	123

which I spoke to you when I saw you.
I should like to know your opinion of
both, but particularly of Combes work.
It appears to me to unfold very impor-
tant views relative to the advancement
and amelioration of the species, and af-
fords a solution, in my humble opinion,
of many of those difficulties connected
with the moral government of the uni-
verse which puzzle those accustomed to
think of such subjects.
	I sincerely trust that you may pre-
serve your health, because upon it de-
pend cheerfulness and all the blessings.
A Spanish proverb says, He who loves
wealth loves much; he who loves friends
loves more; but he who loves health
loves all. May happier and brighter
days be yet in store for you and yours!
I retain the most pleasing recollection
of my interview with you, and I shall
have resort to your works with greater
delight than ever, now that I know you.
Mr. Chambers desires me to return you
his grateful thanks for your kindness to
me as his friend. I shall be exceeding-
ly happy to hear from you when you
have leisure to write; and believe me, I
will always continue to feel the liveliest
interest in your welfare.
	Yours faithfully, A. IRELAND.

ALEXANDER TRELAND TO LEIGH HUNT.

MANCHESTER, May 4, 1845.

	Mv DEAR Sin,  You may not per-
haps recollect me; but I shall never
forget a delightful evening I spent with
you six or seven years ago in Chelsea,
where you welcomed me to your house,
and allowed me the privilege of a few
hours conversationwith you about Lamb,
Hazlitt, Coleridge, and Poetry and Life,
and all these glorious things.
	Since then many things have happened
to me, both sad and sweet, but all tend-
ing to make me love my fellow creatures
more and more, and to have stronger
and firmer hopes in the advancement of
our common nature.
	I have been for two years residing in
Manchester, engaged in commercial pur-
suits. I am connected with the Athe~
nlcum, a literary institution of consid-
erable importance, and of which you
have doubtless heard. My object in
writing to you is to ascertain whether
you would be willing to be chairman at
our next great soir~e. Dickens was our
first chairman, Disraeli our second, and
we are now beginning to think of a
third.

Leigh Hunts first letter to Ireland
shows that even in the chorus of fame
which was then assailing him the author
enjoyed the single but sincere note which
his young worshiper sounded: 
CHELSEA, February 21 [about 18401.

	M~ DEAR Sin,  I wish I could write
you as long and welcome a letter as the
one I have received, and cram it full of
all impossible good things besides; but
overwhelmed as I am with heaps of writ-
ten and printed congratulations, every
one of which I am bound in gratitude,
as well as impelled with delight, to an-
swer, I am forced to make my thanks
as brief as I can, consistently with my
feelings. Many thanks for the letter it-
self, and the length of it, and all you
say in it, and the time at which it was
written, and above all for the news you
tell inc of Mrs. Ireland; for the breath
of a woman ever sounds the best as well
as the highest of all the notes of joy.
With best returns of congratulations to
you both, and hope to see you together
some day on the green borders of Lon-
don (for I am going to flit northward
towards my old meadows), I am ever,
dear sir,
	Your faithful and obliged servant,
LEIGH HUNT.


	Like everybody else, Hunt seems to
have fallen victim to the memorable epi-
demic of influenza in 1841; for he writes
from Kensington under date of February
16 of that year: </PB>
<PB REF="IMG00130" SEQ="0130" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="124">124 Some New Letters by Leigh Hant, and Stevenson.

	MY DEAR IRELAND,  Pardon this
brief word of a note. I have been so
unwell with influenza, and am so with
the consequences of it, I seem as if I
bad been walking a hundred miles, and
could nt get the fatigue out of my limbs.
	Ever most truly yours, L. H.

The next letters show that Mr. Ire-
lands admiration for his gifted friend
continued to find expression: 
KENsINGToN, May 31.

	M~ DEAR IRELAND,  My friend Mr.
Ollier informs me that some weeks
ago there was a very kind notice of
me in an article in your old godfather
the Examiner. I fear the godson must
have thought me very insensible for say-
ing nothing about it, but I have never
seen the article. The number of the
Manchester Examiner containingit never
came into my hands.
	Observing the series of notices which
your paper was giving of contemporary
journals, etc., I had delayed making a
remark or two on itself till I had seen
the number in question; and its non-
arrival was therefore doubly perplexing.
Will you have the goodness to inquire
whether any accident stopped it at the
office? When I receive it I will write
again. I have another request to make
you; which is, to constitute yourself, for
one minute, my spiritual representative
at the Amateur supper (luckily for you,
you cannot represent me in the flesh),
and getting up, glass in hand, drink my
kindest affectionate remembrances to my
famous friend, and cordialest wishes for
the Shakespearean welfare of Knowles.
Ever most sincerely yours,
LEIGH HUNT.

	P. 5. You will be glad to know that
Webster has accepted my play, and that
he promises to bring it out early next
season.
KENSINGTON, June 23.

	MY DEAR SIR,  A million thanks
for papers and their contents, and all
kindness. I am forced to write very
briefly, owing to a bad biliosified head;
but you may well imagine what I feel, at
what all kind friends are saying and
doing.
	I hope to thank the Manchester por-
tion of them by and by in person, for,
if I prosper, there is nothing which will
add to my good and pleasure so much
as taking a journey or two gratitude-
wards: in which hope I am ever, my
dear sir, most sincerely
	Your obliged and faithful friend,
LEIGH HUNT.


The following extract from a letter
of Irelands to Leigh Hunt, referring to
the production of Hunts play, A Legend
of Florence, in London, shows the con-
tinned recollection of the memorable
first meeting ten years before: 
I have just been reading in the
Morning Chronicle and Examiner ac
 counts of your new play. Allow me to
express to you the sin&#38; ere pleasure and
glow of satisfaction with which I read
them. Amongst the many congratula-
tions of your friends, be assured none
can be more heartfelt than mine. Your
works have been to me for years a solace
and delight; a kind of sanctuary where
I can retire from the rush of this worka-
day world. I cannot resist the occasion
of sending you a few lines, prompted to
it by this pleasing passage in your his-
tory. Never shall I forget your kind-
ness in permitting me, an entire stranger
( No! I hear you say; an author
and his reader cannot be strangers ),
to spend a few hours with you some ten
years since.
	That the gray - haired boy whose
heart can neer grow old may long be
spared to utter sweet and generous
thoughts, diffusing wherever they go a
cheerful humanity and mirthfulness, is
the prayer of
Your sincere well-wisher,
ALEXANDER IRELAND.</PB>

	This last letter of Hunts shows his
reverence for royalty, and reveals the
sensitive vanity of the man. A play is,
after all, the last thing in the world on
which a man can rationally take criticism.

HAMMERSMITH, October 27 [about 1849].

	M~ DEAR SIR,  Many thanks for
your handsome notice of my play. Next
to this, your approbation of it. I was
particularly pleased to find that Mr.
Montgomery gave way to his fervour so
properly, on the occasion you allude to.
	I used to make Ellen Tree laugh, dur-
ing the rehearsals of the part, by re-
minding Mr. Anderson that he was not
to be indecent, but to clasp his mistress
right heartily, and as if the only thing
to be ashamed of were his doing it by
halves. For you know there is apt to
be a cold suggestiveness on the stage, on
such occasions, which is the most inde-
cent of all things. Ah! I wish every-
body had understood the play as thor-
oughly as her fine nature did, or as that
(let me proudly add) of the Queen did.
I do not speak of the poetry, but of the
heart and justice of it. It would have
had a better fortune. But thereby
hangs a tale.
	You speak of the emptiness of the
boxes. There were so few men, one
night, among the audience at Covent
Garden that the same charming actress
wittily said, Those are all the good
husbands in London. The same in-
equality of the sexes will perhaps have
been observable in the Manchester au-
diences. If so, it might be worth your
while (and edifying for them) to notice
it.	Madame Vestris, with an instinctive
apprehension to that effect, wished me
to let Agolanti have his wife back again,
and said that if I did so she would un-
dertake that the play should have a run
of sixty nights. I told her that my con-
science would not allow me; that I felt
I had a piece of legislation in my hands,
the duty of which I could not give up;
and that as the man was not to be di-
vorced (for she would not have the di-
vorce in the play, as originally written)
nothing remained for justice but to kill
him.
	A queens opinion, however, may do
much, in spite of conventional errors.
How it happened that the Legend of
Florence was not repeated at the Prin-
cesss Theatre, as other plays performed
at Windsor had been, I have yet to learn,
and even to inquire,  so strangely in-
curious am I, and so much in the habit
of waiting events; but I ought to have
done so, and must, now that my Auto-
biography is to be continued. Strange
things have been told me, but I have
never investigated them. Not that the
Queen had anything to do with them.
Her Majesty (God bless the dear, warm-
hearted woman) has never done me any-
thing but good and honour, from first to
last.
	Perhaps you are not aware that after
she had first witnessed the performance
of the play at Covent Garden, the Queen,
on her way out of the theatre, said to
the stage manager, This is a beauti-
ful play you have given us to-night, Mr.
Bartly. Bartly, with great good na-
ture as well as presence of mind, said to
the Queen, I think the author would
be very happy if I might repeat to him
those gracious words of your Majesty.
Do so, by all means, said the cordial
sovereign.
	Lord John Russell told me that Prince
Albert expressed the same opinion of the
piece. You are aware, I believe, that
the Queen went more than once to see
it at Covent Garden; twice, I know, but
Madame Vestris told a friend that she
went four times. She afterward had it
performed at Windsor; and this, I think,
it might have been good for the Man-
chester people to be told, in the plays
announcements. I had thought of say-
ing as much to the manager, myself, in a
letter to him; but living so retired, and
ignorant of so many things which other
people know, I am not acquainted with</PB>

his name, and did not like to address
him merely by his office. Perhaps, if
you, or some friend of yours, have per-
sonal knowledge of him, you would be
kind enough to convey my compliments
to him and state my opinion on the sub-
ject; perhaps let him have a sight of
this letter.
	I cannot help thinking, knowing what
an effect royalty has at all times, and how
just a sympathy the people have with it,
in its present English shape, that if the
manager were to speak of the play in his
bills and announcements as performed
by her Majestys command at Windsor
Castle, the result to the boxes might be
good for all parties concerned.
	With constant pleasure in rending,
every Saturday or Monday (according
as the postman chooses to gratify me),
both your original articles (often pluck-
ing out the whole heart of the questions)
and the judicious and entertaining selec-
tions which you make from books, I am
ever, dear sir,
	Thankfully and faithfully yours,
LEJGH HUNT.


	Another of the literary men whom Mr.
Ireland had among his correspondents
was Robert Louis Stevenson. The first
of the following letters from him  the
only real letter of the three; the others
are but notes  is very characteristic, in-
tense, eager, and hopeful.

DAvos, SwITZERLAND [1881 ?].

	M~ DEAR SIR,  This formidable pa-
per need not alarm you: it argues no-
thing beyond penury of other sorts, and
it is not at all likely to lead me into a
long letter. If I were at all grateful,
it would, for yours has just passed for
me a considerable part of a stormy even-
ing. And speaking of gratitude, let me
at once, and with becoming eagerness,
accept your kind invitation to Bowden.
I shall hope, if we can agree as to dates,
when I am nearer hand, to come to you
some time in the month of May. I was
pleased to hear you were a Scot,  I feel
more at home with my compatriots al-
ways; perhaps the more we are away,
the more we feel that bond.
	You ask about Davos. I have dis-
coursed about it already, rather sillily, I
think, in the Pall Mall, and I mean to
say no more; but the ways of the Muse
are dubious and obscure, and who knows?
I may be wild again. As a place of resi-
dence, beyond a splendid climate, it has to
my eyes but one advantage,  the neigh-
bourhood of J. A. Symonds. I dare say
you know his work, but the man is far
more interesting. Davos has done me,
in my two winters of Alpine exile, much
good; so much that I hope to leave it now
forever, but would not be understood to
boast. In my present unpardonably crazy
state, any cold night sends me skipping,
either back to Davos or further off. It
is dear, a little dreary, very far from
many things that both my taste and my
needs prompt me to seek, and altogether
not the place I should choose of my free
will.
	I am chilled by your description of
the man in question; though I had al-
most argued so much from his cold and
undigested volume. If the republication
does not interfere with my publisher, it
will not interfere with me; but there,
of course, comes the hitch. I do not
know Mr. Bentley, and I fear all pub-
lishers like the devil, from legend and ex-
perience both. However, when I come
to town, we shall, I hope, meet and un-
derstand each other, as well as author
and publisher ever do. I liked his let-
ters; they seemed hearty, kind, and per-
sonal. Still, I am notedly suspicious of
the trade; your news of this republica-
tion alarms me.
	The best of the present French nov-
elists seems to me, incomparably, Dan-
det. Les Rois en Exil comes very near
being a masterpiece. For Zola I have
no toleration, though the curious, emi-
nently bourgeois, and eminently French
creature has power of a kind. But I</PB>

would he were deleted! I would not
give a chapter of old Dumas (meaning
hiniself, not his collaborators) for the
whole boiling of the Zolas. Romance
with the smallpox (or the great one), 
diseased  and black-hearted, and fun-
damentally at enmity with joy.
	I trust that Mrs. Ireland does not ob-
ject to smoking; aud if you are a tea-
totaler, I beg you to mention it before
I come. I have all the vices; some of the
virtues also, let us hope,  that, at least,
of being a Scotchman and
Yours very sincerely,
ROBERT Louis STEVENSON.

	P. 5. My father was in the old High
School the last year, and walked in the
procession to the new. I blush to own I
am an Academy boy; it seems modern,
and smacks of the soil.
	P. P. S. I enclose a good joke,  at
least, I think so,  my first attempts, and
wood-engravings printed by my stepson,
a boy of thirteen. I will put in also
one of my later attempts. I have been
nine days at the art: observe my pro
gress.	R. L. S.

	The shadow of illness lay over all the
work Stevenson did, but he maintained
a merry daring till the end.

SPEv VIEW, KIEGEOssIE, August 18 [1883 ?].

	M~ DEAR SIR,  I am afraid the 14th
of September is too late for me, and
we 11 have to delay the visit till next
summer. I regret this extremely; but
I must be thinking of something more to
the purpose  finding a shelter for my
head  by that date.
	I am feeling better, though I have
been worse, since I saw you; but I am in
hopes that I shall get through the sum-
mer, at least, without harm, and then
some better climate in winter will en-
able me to progress. Summer seems
worse than winter, somehow.
	Pray excuse my delay. This is a for-
mula of mine,  a elich6.
	But my wife has had a relapse, and be-
tween that and dyspepsia I have not had
my head on my shoulders this while past.
With many thanks, believe me,
Yours very truly,
ROBERT Louis STEVENSON.

	Did I ever tell you with how great an
interest I had read your reminiscences of
Carlyle and Mrs. C.? If not, it was ten-
fold ungrateful. I have not often read
anything so convincing. I believe I felt
both of them more nearly in your paper
than anywhere else. R. L. S.

	The pages below referred to, which
Stevenson found so much pleasure in hav-
ing reprinted in the Enchiridion, were
taken from an article published in the
Fortnightly Review of April, 1881, on
The Morality of the Profession of Let-
ters. The Hazhitt scheme was a pro-
posal by Stevenson to prepare a volume
on William Hazlitt for the English Men
of Letters series.

H6TEL DES ILES DOR,
HxkiiEs, FRANcE, Novenber [1883 ?].
	M~ DEAR SIR,  Much ill health, and
a whole odyssey of changes, and a sea of
confused affairs must stand my excuse for
this long silence. I am now better, much
better, and have got to a place where,
at least, I take a moments breath; and
so I hasten to thank you for your having
kindly sent me the Enchiridion, and still
more kindly found a place for a word of
mine in so select a company. It is much
easier for you to imagine than for me
to express (that, at least, is an original
phrase) the gratification I felt when I
saw my name in your collection: I fear
it was the extract I enjoyed the most!
 but the whole work seems admirably
done, and I find it Rot only a beautiful
little book for the eye, but quite one of
those pocket volumes that a man can read
and re-read, without end or weariness.
	The Hazhitt scheme lies, for the pre-
sent, high and dry; I do not even see
my way to revisit England this year, and
it would be tempting Providence to make</PB>

sure of the next. I believe I require a
long absence and much care, to get pro-
perly on my legs again, and the abomi-
nable folly of getting well in winter, only
to come home and fall ill again in au-
tumn, is one which I am eager to avoid
repeating. Please pardon me as well as
you can for that sort of fault to which, I
fear, I have already only too much ac-
customed you, and believe me,
Yours very sincerely,
ROBERT Louis STEVENSON.

A.	IRELAND, EsQ.


	As these fragmentary letters show,
Mr. Ireland was exceedingly rich in re-
miniscence; he could tell of interviews
with Sir Walter Scott, De Quincey, and
William and Dorothy Wordsworth; he
numbered among his friends Thomas
Campbell, Leigh Hunt, Thomas Car-
lyle, Charles and Mary Cowden Clarke,
Oliver Wendell Holmes, James Russell
Lowell, Robert Louis Stevenson, and
many more. Carlyle, from whose caustic
portraiture so few of his friends did not
suffer, said of Mr. Ireland in 1847: A.
solid, dark, broad, rather heavy ma. ; full
of energy and broad sagacity and prac-
ticability,  infinitely well affected to the
man Emerson. And the man Emer-
son has said of him, with equal truth
and greater warmth: At the landing
in Liverpool I found my Manchester cor-
respondent awaiting me. . . . He added
to solid virtues an infinite sweetness and
bonhomie. There seemed a pool of
honey about his heart which lubricated
all his speech and action with fine jets
of mead.
	At the age of seventy Mr. Ireland
retired from active connection with the
Examiner and Times, and the gradual
failure of the paper (which was actually
sold, and passed out of existence some
ten years later) obliged him ~o spend
the remaining years of his life in the
greatest simplicity of living.

THE RUSSIAN JEW IN AMERICA.

	ONE afternoon in the summer of 1881,
when the Jewish quarter of Kieff was
filled with groans and its pavements were
strewn with the d6bris of destroyed
homes, a group of young men entered
one of the synagogues of the ancient city.
They were well dressed, and their gener-
al appearance bespoke education and re-
finement. The rabbi had proclaimed a
day of fasting and prayer, and the house
of God was crowded with sobbing victims
of the recent riots, but as the newcomers
made their way to the Holy Ark silence
fell upon the congregation. The young
men were students of the University of
St. Vladimir, and although sons of Israel
like the others, their presence at a syna-
gogue was an unusual sight.
	Brethren, said the spokesman of the
delegation, struggling with his sobs, we
are a committee of the Jewish students of
the university, sent to clasp hands with
you and to mingle our tears with your
tears. We are here to say to you, We
are your brothers; Jews like yourselves,
like our fathers! We have striven to
adopt the language and manners of our
Christian fellow countrymen; we have
brought ourselves up to an ardent love of
their literature, of their culture, of their
progress. We have tried to persuade
ourselves that we are children of Mother
Russia. Alas! we have been in error.
The terrible events which have called
forth this fast and these tears have
aroused us from our dream. The voice
of the blood of our outraged brothers
and sisters cries unto us that we are only</PB></P>

THE RUSSIAN JEW IN AMERICA.

	ONE afternoon in the summer of 1881,
when the Jewish quarter of Kieff was
filled with groans and its pavements were
strewn with the d6bris of destroyed
homes, a group of young men entered
one of the synagogues of the ancient city.
They were well dressed, and their gener-
al appearance bespoke education and re-
finement. The rabbi had proclaimed a
day of fasting and prayer, and the house
of God was crowded with sobbing victims
of the recent riots, but as the newcomers
made their way to the Holy Ark silence
fell upon the congregation. The young
men were students of the University of
St. Vladimir, and although sons of Israel
like the others, their presence at a syna-
gogue was an unusual sight.
	Brethren, said the spokesman of the
delegation, struggling with his sobs, we
are a committee of the Jewish students of
the university, sent to clasp hands with
you and to mingle our tears with your
tears. We are here to say to you, We
are your brothers; Jews like yourselves,
like our fathers! We have striven to
adopt the language and manners of our
Christian fellow countrymen; we have
brought ourselves up to an ardent love of
their literature, of their culture, of their
progress. We have tried to persuade
ourselves that we are children of Mother
Russia. Alas! we have been in error.
The terrible events which have called
forth this fast and these tears have
aroused us from our dream. The voice
of the blood of our outraged brothers
and sisters cries unto us that we are only</PB>

strangers in the land which we have been
used to call our home; that we are only
stepchildren here, waifs to be trampled
upon and dishonored. There is no hope
for Israel in Russia. The salvation of
the downtrodden people lies in other
parts,  in a land beyond the seas, which
knows no distinction of race or faith,
which is a mother to Jew and Gentile
alike. In the great republic is our re-
demption from the brutalities and igno-
minies to which we are subjected in this
our birthplace. In America we shall
find rest; the stars and stripes will wave
over the true home of our people. To
America, brethren! To America!
	On February 2, 1882, a public meet-
ing was held at Chickering Hall, New
York. The proceedings were presided
over by William R. Grace, then mayor
of the city, with Judge Noah Davis,
Hamilton Fish, Robert L. Stuart, Anson
Phelps Stokes, Charles H. Van Brunt,
Joseph H. Choate, and other well-known
citizens as vice-chairmen. Ex-Secretary
Evarts and the Rev. Dr. Hale were
the principal speakers. The resolutions,
adopted unanimously, and which met
with the hearty approval of the entire
American people, recited that the citi-
zens of New York have heard with sad-
ness and indignation of the sufferings
inflicted upon the Jews of Russia, and
that in the name of civilization we pro-
test against the spirit of medi~val perse-
cution. In this age the recognized equal.
ity of all men, irrespective of their reli-
gious confessions, an essential element in
American constitutions, is a principle
and a practice which secures the loyal
devotion of all classes. This is eminent-
ly true of the Hebrews, who constitute
faithful citizens and subjects wherever
accorded the rights of manhood. The
resolutions continued: We sympathize
with our fellow citizens of the Hebrew
faith in their sorrow for their afflicted
brethren in Russia, and in their energetic
efforts for the welcome of the exiles.
	The two gatherings, held in two hemi

spheres, mark the opening of an impor-
tant chapter in the history of the Jewish
race, the beginning of a new great exo-
dus of the wandering people. In the
summer following the Chickering Hall
meeting almost every incoming trans-
atlantic steamship brought hundreds of
Russian refugees to these shores.
	Before 1882 the emigration of Rus-
sian Jews to America was restricted to
the provinces lying about the Niemen
and the Dwina, notably to the govern-
ment of Souvalki, where economical con-
ditions caused Catholic peasants as well
as Jewish tradesmen and artisans to go
elsewhere in search of bread. Some
of these Lithuanian and Polish Jews
sought their fortune in the southern dis-
tricts of the empire, where their brethren
enjoyed a high average of prosperity,
while the more venturesome crossed the
frontier to embark for the New World.
Among the Jews of the south (Ukraine
and New Russia) and of the central pro-
vinces (Great Russia) self - expatriation
was an unknown thing. But with the
breaking out of the epidemic of anti-Jew-
ish riots, which rendered thousands of
well-to-do families homeless and pemini-
less, Hebrew immigration to this country
underwent an abrupt change in charac-
ter as well as in volume.
	Not only did the government of Al-
exander III. blink at the atrocities and
practically encourage them, but it even
sent a series of measures in their wake
which had the effect of depriving new
multitudes of stepchildren of their
means of livelihood, and of dislodging
thousands of families from their long-
established homes. The cry To Amer-
ica!  was taken up by city after city and
hamlet after hamlet, till its fascinating
echo reached every synagogue in the em-
pire. Many left because they had been
driven from their homes, and these were
joined by many others who, while affect-
ed neither by the outbursts of mob vio-
lence nor by the new restrictions, suc-
cumbed to the contagious example of their</PB>

co-religionists and to a general sense of
insecurity and of wounded race pride.
The effiux which had hitherto been spo-
radic suddenly became epidemic. The
prosperous and the cultivated  an ele-
ment formerly rare among the Jewish
arrivals at New York  came to form
a respectable minority in nearly every
company of immigrants which, thanks to
the assistance of the Hebrew communi-
ties of western Europe and of this coun-
try, the steamships brought from the
domains of the Czar. The Jewish col-
lege student, whose faith barred him
from the educational institutions of the
empire, sought these shores in order
to complete his studies, and many a
graduated physician, chemist, dentist,
architect, and nrtist came here to take
up the profession from which he was
interdicted at his birthplace.
	Sixteen years have elapsed. The Jew-
ish population in the United States has
grown from a quarter of a million to
about one million. Scarcely a large
American town but has some Russo-Jew-
ish names in its directory, with an edu~
cated Russian-speaking minority forming
a colony within a Yiddish-speaking colo-
fly, while cities like New York, Chicago,
Philadelphia, and Boston have each a
Ghetto rivaling in extent of population
the largest Jewish cities in Russia, Aus-
tria, and Roumania. The number of
Jewish residents in Manhattan Rorough
is estimated at two hundred and fifty
thousand, making it the largest centre of
Hebrew population in the world. The
Russian tongue, which twenty years ago
was as little used in this country as Per-
sian, has been added to the list of lan-
guages spoken by an appreciable portion
of the polyglot immigrant population.
	Have the newcomers justified the wel-
come extended to them from Chickering
Hall? Have they proved a desirable
accession to the American nation?
	Let another man praise thee, and
not thine own mouth; a stranger, and
not thine own lips, is a proverb current
among the people who form the subject
of this paper; and being one of them, I
feel that it would be better, before citing
figures and facts, to let Gentile Amen-
cans who have made a study of the New
York Ghetto answer the question. Here
is what Mr. Jacob A. Riis, an accepted
authority on how the other half lives,
has to say of Jewish immigrants 
They [the Jews] do not rot in their
slum, but, rising, pull it up after them.
	- As to their poverty, they brought
us boundless energy and industry to over-
come it. - . - They brought temperate
habits and a redeeming love of home.
Their strange customs proved the strong-
est ally of the Gentile health officer in
his warfare upon the slum. The death-
rate of poverty-stricken Jew - town, de-
spite its crowding, is lower always than
that of the homes of the rich. - . . I am
a Christian, and hold that in his belief
the Jew is sadly in error. So that he
may respect mine I insist on fair play
for him all round. I am sure that our
city has to-day no better and no more
loyal citizen than the Jew, be he poor or
rich, and none she has less to be ashamed
of.
	The late Miss Ida Van Etten, who, as
a worker among the factory girls of the
East Side, had ample opportunities to
study the Russian Jew at close range,
found that politically the Jews possess
many characteristics of the best citizens.
Mr. James B. Reynolds, who, in his
capacity of head worker of the univer-
sity settlement of New York, has for
many years been in direct touch with
the people of the very heart of the Jew-
ish district, gives the following general
description of Hebrew immigrants 
My acquaintance has been mainly
with the Russian, Polish, and Roumanian
Jews. The first quality in them wbich
impresses me is their intellectual avidity.
Much has been said about their desire
for gain. But while one must recognize
among them an almost universal and
certainly commendable desire to improve</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00137" SEQ="0137" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="131">	The Russian Jew in Amerzca.	131

their condition, the proportionate num-
ber of those with intellectual aims is
larger than that of any other race that
I have encountered. An essential ori-
ental quality of mind and character also
impresses me. This is reflected in a
deep intensity of feeling, high imagina-
tion, and quickly varying emotions. An-
other oriental attribute is an occasional
outburst of the extremest idealism, with
an utter disregard of the restraining
power of circumstances and conditions.
This extreme idealism sometimes makes
them impractical, but combined with
their intellectual traits produces a char-
acter often full of imagination, aspira-
tion, and appreciation.
	Another Gentile American whose
statement is entitled to consideration is
Mr. Lawrence Dunphy, superintendent
of the workhouse at Blackwells Island
(New York city), who is quoted in the
report submitted in 1893 by Dr. Radin,
visiting chaplain of prisons, to the Jew-
ish Ministers Association.
	Rabbi, said Mr. Dunphy (in 1892,
ten years after the beginning of the great
Jewish influx) to the author of the report,
I am happy to say that we do not need a
Jewish chaplain at the workhouse. We
have a very small number of Jews among
the prisoners. Yon can be proud of
your race: you are indeed a good class
of citizens. Usually, the degraded peo-
ple confined at the workhouse once are
brought back very often; but I have very
seldom seen a Jew brought back here a
second time.
	Such are the impressions of Christian
Americans on a subject upon which they
speak with the coiifidence of positive
knowledge, the result of close and un-
biased observation. If there are people
who take a less favorable view of the
Russian and the Polish Hebrew, they are
not to be found among those whose op-
portunities for studying the subject by
personal observation and whose qualifi-
cations for the gask are kno~vn to the
public.
	The question of limiting immigration
engages the attention of Congress at
frequent intervals, and bills aiming at re-
form in this directioii are brought before
the Senate and the House. In its bear-
ings upon the Russian, Austrian, or Rou-
manian Jew, the case is summed up by
the opinions cited. Now let us hear the
testimony of facts on the subject. The
invasion of foreign illiteracy is one of the
principal dangers which laws restricting
immigration are meant to allay, and it
is with the illiteracy of the New York
Ghetto that we shall concern ourselves
first.
	The last report of the commissioner-
general of immigration gives twenty-
eight per cent as the proportion of illit-
erates among the immigrants who came
during the past year from Russia. The
figure would be much lower, should the
computation be confined to immigrants
of the Mosaic faith instead of including
the mass of Polish and Lithuanian pea-
sants, of whose number only a very small
part can read and write. It may not be
generally known that every Russian and
Polish Jew, without exception, can read
his Hebrew Bible as well as a Yiddish
newspaper, and that many of the Jewish
arrivals at the barge office are versed in
rabbinical literature, not to speak of the
large number of those who can read and
write Russian. When attention is di-
rected to the Russian Jew in America, a
state of affairs is found which still fur-
ther removes him from the illiterate class,
and gives him a place among the most
ambitious and the quickest to learn both
the written and the spoken language of
the adopted country, and among the ea~i-
est to be assimilated with the population.
	The cry raised by the Russian anti-
Semites against the backwardness of the
Jew in adopting the tongue and the man-
ners of his birthplace, in the same breath
in which they urge tIme government to
close the doors of its schools to subjects
of the Hebrew faith, reminds one of
the hypocritical miser who kept his gate</PB>

guarded by ferocious dogs, and then re-
proached his destitute neighbor with hold-
ing huinself aloof. This country, where
the schools and colleges do not discrimi-
nate between Jew and Gentile, has quite
another tale to tell. The several public
evening schools of the New York Ghetto,
the evening school supported from the
Baron de Hirsch fund, and the two or
three private establishments of a similar
character are attended by thousands of
Jewish immigrants, the great majority
of whom come here absolutely ignorant
of the language of their native country.
Surely nothing can be more inspiring to
the public-spirited citizen, nothing wor-
thier of the interest of the student of im-
migration, than the sight of a gray-haired
tailor, a patriarch in appearance, coming,
after a hard days work at a sweat-shop,
to spell cat, mat, rat, and to grapple
with the difficulties of th and w.
Such a spectacle may be seen in scores
of the class-rooms in the schools referred
to. Hundreds of educated young He-
brews earn their living, and often pay
their way through college, by giving pri-
vate lessons in English in the tenement
houses of the district,  a type of young
men and women peculiar to the Ghetto.
The pupils of these private tutors are
the same poor overworked sweat - shop
hands of whom the public hears so
much and knows so little. A tenement
house kitchen turned, after a scanty sup-
per, into a class-room, with the head of
the family and his boarder bent over an
English school reader, may perhaps claim
attention as one of the curiosities of life
in a great city; in the Jewish quarter,
however, it is a common spectacle.
	Nor does the tailor or peddler who
hires these tutors, as a rule, content him-
self with an elementary knowledge of
the language of his new home. I know
many Jewish workmen who before they
came here knew not a word of Russian,
and were ignorant of any book except the
Scriptures, or perhaps the Talmud, but
whose range of English reading places
them on a level with the average college-
bred American.
	The grammar schools of the Jewish
quarter are overcrowded with children
of immigrants, who, for progress and de-
portment, are rated with the very best in
the city. At least 500 of 1677 students
at the New York City College, where
tuition and books are free, are Jewish
boys from the East Side. The poor la-
borer who will pinch himself to keep his
child at college, rather than send him to
a factory that he may contribute to the
familys income, is another type peculiar
to the Ghetto.
	The innumerable Yiddish publications
with which the quarter is flooded are
also a potent civilizing and Americaniz-
lug agency. The Russian Jews of New
York, Philadelphia, and Chicago have
within the last fifteen years created a
vast periodical literature which furnishes
intellectual food not only to themselves,
but also to their brethren in Europe. A
feverish literary activity unknown among
the Jews in Russia, Roumania, and Aus-
tria, but which has arisen here among
the immigrants from those countries, ed-
ucates thousands of ignorant tailors and
peddlers, lifts their intelligence, facili-
tates their study of English, and opens
to them the doors of the English library
The five million Jews living under the
Czar had not a single Yiddish daily pa-
per even when the government allowed
such publications, while their fellow coun-
trymen and co - rehigionists who have
taken up their abode in America publish
six dailies (five in New York and one in
Chicago), not to mention the countless
Yiddish weeklies and monthlies, and the
pamphlets and books which to-day make
New York the largest Yiddish book mar-
ket in the world. If much that is con-
tained in these publications is rather
crude, they are in this respect as good 
or as bad  as a certain class of English
novels and periodicals from which they
partly derive their inspiration. On the
other hand, their readers are sure to find</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00139" SEQ="0139" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="133">	The Russian Jew in America.	133

in them a good deal of what would be
worthy of a more cultivated language.
They have among their contributors some
of the best Yiddish writers in the world,
men of undeniable talent, and these sup-
ply the Jewish slums with popular arti-
cles on science, on the history and insti-
tutions of the adopted country, transla-
tions from the best literatures of Europe
and America, as well as original sketches,
stories, and poems of decided merit. It
is sometimes said (usually by those who
know the Ghetto at second hand) that
this unnatural development of Yiddish
journalism threatens to keep the immi-
grant from an acquaintance with Eng-
lish. Nothing could be further from the
truth. The Yiddish periodicals are so
many preparatory schools from which
the reader is sooner or later promoted to
the English newspaper, just as the sev-
eral Jewish theatres prepare his way to
the Broadway playhouse, or as the Yid-
dish lecture serves him as a stepping-
stone to that English-speaking, self-edu-
cational society, composed of working-
men who have lived a few years in the
country, which is another characteristic
feature of life in the Ghetto. Truly,
the Jews do not rot in their slum, but,
rising, pull it up after them.
	Foreign criminality is the next evil
with which restrictive legislation is to
grapple. As to the Jews, it may suffice,
in addition to Superintendent Dunphys
experience, to point out the fact that
while they constitute six per cent of the
total population of the state of New York,
they furnish only three per cent of the
prisoners of that state. When attention
is limited to the immigrant residents in
the state, which is more to the point, the
statistical data on the subject are still
more favorable to the Jews. The ratio
of foreign-born Jews to the total immi-
grant population is fifteen per cent, yet
less than five per cent of the foreign-born
prisoners in the state are of the Hebrew
race.
	The influx of foreign pauperism is an-
other source of alarm to the immigration
reformer. The foreign population of
this country, says Dr. Wines in his
Eleventh Census Bulletin, contributes,
directly or indirectly, in the persons of
the foreign-born or of their immediate
descendants, very nearly three fifths of
all the paupers supported in almshouses.
In the case of the Jews, however, the
situation is more than reassuring. This
will be seen by contrasting this general
proportion with the figures quoted in
Dr. Radins report: That eleven Jew-
ish inmates are to be found at the Black-
wells Island ahmshouse among a total of
2170 males is sufficient proof how little
the poor and needy among us become a
burden on public charity. Those who are
opposed to the immigration of Jews may
heed this.
	Of far greater importance, however,
is the effect which imniigration has upon
the general scale of wages. Speaking
of the poor and ignorant foreigners who
seek these shores, United States Senator
Fairbanks observed (in his speech deliv-
ered before the Senate in defense of the
anti-illiteracy bill, January 11, 1898):
Their standard of living and wages is
such that they will accept lower compen-
sation and harder conditions than our
own workmen could or should accept.
The natural and inevitable result of their
coming will be to depress the wages of
labor.... The consideration of the pend-
ing measure, as Mr. Blame said of the
Chinese exclusion act, connects itself in-
timately and inseparably with the labor
question. It is labor, then, whose in-
terests are to be consulted primarily; and
against the Jewish immigrants labor has
no grievance.
	The only time when Jewish laborers
threatened to come iii serious conflict with
the cause of American workingmen was
during the great longshoremens strike
of 1882, at the very beginning of the new
era in the history of Jewish immuigra-
tion. Ignorant of the meaning of strikes,
the newcomers blindly allowed them-</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00140" SEQ="0140" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="134">	134	The Russian Jew in America.

selves to be persuaded by representa-
tives of ship - owners to take the places
of former employees. No sooner, how-
ever, had the situation been explained to
the scabs than they abandoned their
wheelbarrows, amid the, applause of the
striking Gentiles. Since then the Jew-
ish workmen have been among the most
faithful members of the various trades-
unions of the country. Outside of the
clothing trades, Russian and Polish Jews
are to be found in considerable numbers
in the cigar industry, in the silk facto-
ries and the hat factories of New Jersey,
in the shoe factories of Massachusetts, in
the machine shops of Connecticut, among
the jewelers of Rhode Island, and in sev-
eral other trades: in all these employ-
ments their relations with their American
associates are of the most cordial nature.
Whatever may be the social chances of
a Jewish banker, the Jewish working-
men of New England and their Ameri-
can shopmates are on visiting terms. So
far from depressing wages and bringing
down the standard of living, the Jewish
workingman has been among the fore-
most in the struggle for the interests of
the wage-earning class of the country.
If he brings with him a lower standard
of living, his keen susceptibilities, his
intellectual avidity, and his almost
universal and certainly commendable de-
sire to improve his condition impel
him to raise that standard to the level
of his new surroundings. Unlike some
of the immigrants of other nationalities,
the Essex Street Jew does not remain
here in the same plight in which he came.
Poor as he is, he strives to live like a
civilized man, and the money which an-
other workman perhaps might spend on
drink and sport he devotes to the im-
provement of his home and the education
of his children. When Senator Fairbanks
speaks of that immigration which does
not seek to build homes among us as
the most objectionable element, as one
whose exclusion will be no loss, he
surely cannot refer to the Russian Jew;
and if it may be stated as axiomatic
that home-builders are good citizens,
the Jewish immigrant makes a very good
citizen indeed.
	I have visited the houses of many
American workingmen, in New England
and elsewhere, as well as the residences
of their Jewish shopmates, and I have
found scarcely a point of difference.
The squalor of the typical tenement
house of the Ghetto is far more objec-
tionable and offensive to the people who
are doomed to live in it than to those
who undertake slumming expeditions as
a fad, and is entirely due to the same
economical conditions which are respon-
sible for the lack of cleanliness in the
homes of such poor workiugmen as are
classed among the most desirable con-
tribution to the population. The houses
of the poor Irish laborers who dwell
on the outskirts of the great New York
Ghetto (and they are not worse than the
houses occupied by the poor Irish fami-
lies of the West Side) are not better, in
point of cleanliness, than the residences
of their Jewish neighbors. The follow-
ing statement, which is taken from the
report made by the tenement house com-
mittee to the Senate and Assembly of the
state of New York on January 17, 1895,
throws light on the subject.
	It is evident, says the committee,
that there are other potent causes be-
sides density of population at work to
affect the death-rate of the tenement dis-
tricts, and the most obvious one is race
or nationality. It will be observed at
once that the wards showing the great-
est house density combined with a low
death - rate, namely the tenth and sev-
enth wards, are very largely populated by
Russian and Polish Jews. This is, in
fact, the Jewish quarter of the city. On
the other hand, the wards having the
highest death - rate . . . constitute two
of the numerous Italian colonies which
are distributed through the city. . .
The greatest density (57.2 tenants to
a house) is in the tenth ward (almost</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00141" SEQ="0141" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="135">	The Russian Jew in America.	135

exclusively occupied by Jews), which
also has the lowest death-rate      he
low death-rates of the seventh and tenth
wards are largely accounted for by the
fact previously mentioned, that they are
populated largely by Russian Jews.
	To be sure, life in a tenth ward tene-
ment house is wretched enough, but this
has nothing to do with the habits and
inclinations of its inmates. It is a broad
subject, one which calls in question the
whole economic arrangement of our time,
and of which the sweating system  the
great curse of the Ghetto  is only one
detail.
	Is the Russian Jew responsible for the
sweating system? He did not bring it
with him. He found it already devel-
oped here. In its varied forms it ex-
ists in other industries as well as in the
tailoring trades. But far from resign-
ing himself to his burden the Jewish
tailor is ever struggling to shake it from
his shoulder. iNor are his efforts futile.
In many instances the sweat-shop system
has been abolished or its curse mitigated.
The sweating system and its political
ally the ward heeler are accountable
for ninety - nine per cent of whatever
vice may be found in the Ghetto, and the
Jewish tailor is slowly but surely eman-
cipating himself from both.  The re-
demption of the workers must be effected
by the workers themselves  is the motto
of the two dailies which the Jewish
workingmen publish for themselves in
New York. The recurring tailor strikes,
whose frequency has been seized upon
by the funny men of the daily press,
are far less droll than they are repre-
sented to be. Would that the public
could gain a deeper insight into these
struggles than is afforded by newspaper
reports! Hidden under an uncouth sur-
face would be found a great deal of
what constitutes the true poetry of mod-
ern life,  tragedy more heart-rending,
examples of a heroism more touching,
more noble, and more thrilling, than any-
thing that the richest imagination of the
romanticist can invent. While to the
outside observer the struggles may ap-
pear a fruitless repetition of meaningless
conflicts, they are, like the great labor
movement of which they are a part, ever
marching onward, ever advancing.
	The anti-Semitic assertion that the Jew
as a rule avoids productive labor, which
is pure calumny so far as the Jews of
Russia, Austria, and Roumania are con-
cerned, would certainly be out of place
in this country, where at least eighty per
cent of all Jewish immigrants are among
the most diligent wage-earners. As to
the remainder, it includes, besides a large
army of poor peddlers, thousands of such
business men as news-dealers and rag-
men, whose occupations are scarcely less
productive or more agreeable than man-
ual labor. More than ninety per cent of
all the news-stands and news-routes in
the city of New York are now in the
hands of Russian Jews, and most of the
rag-peddlers of New England are per-
sons of the same nationality.
	Farming settlements of Jews have not
been very successful in this country.
There are some Jews in Connecticut, in
New Jersey, and in the Western states
who derive a livelihood from agriculture,
but the majority of the Jewish immi-
grants who took to tilling the soil in the
eighties have been compelled to sell or
to abandon their farms, and to join the
urban population. But how many Amer-
ican farmers have met with a similar
fate! This experience is part of the
same great economic question, and it
does not seem to have any direct bear-
ing on the peculiar inclinations or dis-
inclinations of the Hebrew race. It may
not be generally known that in southern
Russia there are hundreds of flourishing
farms which are owned and worked by
Jews, although, owing to their legal dis-
abilities, the titles are fictitiously held
by Christians.
	Hundreds of Russian and Polish Jews

are to be found on the signs along Broad-
way, but the richest is hardly worth a
quarter of a million.
	As to the educated Jewish immigrants,
the college-bred men and women who
constitute the professional class and the
intellectual aristocracy of the Ghetto,
judged by the standard of the slum dis-
trict, they are prosperous.
	The first educated Russian Hebrews
to come to this country were attracted
neither by the American colleges nor by
the access of their race to a professional
career. In the minds of some cultured
enthusiasts, the general craze for shak-
ing off the dust of the native land and
seeking shelter under the stars and stripes
crystallized in the form of a solution of
the Jewish question. Of the two move-
ments which were set on foot in 1882
by the Palestinians and the Americans,
the American movement seemed the
more successful. Several emigrant par-
ties (the Eternal People, New Odessa)
were sent out with a view to establishing
agricultural colonies. The whole Jew-
ish race was expected by the Americans
to follow suit in joining the farming force
of the United States, and numbers of
Jewish students left the Russian univer-
sities and gymnasiums to enlist in the
pioneer parties. All these parties broke
np, some immediately upon reaching New
York, others after an abortive attempt
to put their plans into practice, although
in several instances undertakings in the
same direction have proved partially suc-
cessful. The would - be pioneers were
scattered through the Union, where they
serve their brethren as physicians, drug-
gists, dentists, lawyers, or teachers.
	Only from three to five per cent of
the vacancies in the Russian nniversities
and gymnasiums are now open to appli-
cants of the Mosaic faith. As a conse-
quence, the various university towns of
Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, France,
and Austria have each a colony of Russo-
Jewish pilgrims of learning. The impe-
cunious student, however, finds a univer
sity course in those countries inaccessible.
Much more favorable in this respect is
the United States, where students from
among the Jewish immigrants find it pos-
sible to sustain themselves during their
college course by some occupation; and
this advantage has to some extent made
this country the Mecca of that class of
young men. It is not, however, always
the educated young men, the graduates
of Russian gymnasiums, from whom the
Russian members at the American col-
leges are recruited. Not to speak of the
hundreds of immigrant boys and girls
who reach the New York City College
or the Normal College by way of the
grammar schools of the Ghetto, there are
in the colleges of New York, Philadel-
phia, Chicago, and Boston, as well as
among the professional men of the Jew-
ish colonies, not a few former peddlers
or workmen who received their first les-
sons in the rudimentary branches of edu-
cation within the walls of an American
tenement house. I was once consulted
by an illiterate Jewish peddler of thirty-
two who was at a loss to choose between
a medical college and a dry goods store.
I have saved two thousand dollars,
he said. Some friends advise me to
go into the dry goods business, but I
wish to be an educated man and live
like one. There are several practicing
physicians with a similar history in the
Ghetto, and in fairness it must be said
that by reading and study, while at col-
lege and afterward, some of them have
become well - informed and cultivated
men. Altogether there are in New York
alone about one hundred and fifty Rus-
sian physicians, about five hundred drug-
gists and drug clerks, some twenty law-
yers, from thirty to forty dentists, and
several representatives of each of the
other professions.
	The Russian-speaking population is
represented also in the colleges for wo-
men. There are scores of educated Rus-
sian girls in the sweat-shops, and their
life is one of direst misery,  of over-</PB>

work in the shop, and of privations at
home.
	Politically the Jewish quarter is among
the most promising districts in the me-
tropolis. The influence of the vote-buyer,
which is the blight of every poor neigh-
borhood in the city, becomes in the Ghetto
smaller and smaller. There is no method
of determining the number of votes
which are secured for either of the two
leading parties by any of the several
forms of bribery enumerated by Mr.
James Bryce; but there are always some
reform parties in the field which have
no money to put up, and whose vote 
whatever might be said of their doctrines
 is exclusively one of principle. At the
last municipal election there were four
such parties in Greater New York. These
were, the Citizens Union,  whose can-
didate for mayor, Mr. Low, appealed to
the voters for purity in municipal elec-
tions,  the Socialist Labor Party, the
Henry George Democracy, and the Pro-
hibitionists. In the four Assembly dis-
tricts (the fourth, eighth, twelfth, and
sixteenth) composing the main Ghetto of
the metropolis, the aggregate vote polled
by these four reform parties was 8678
(with Low in the lead, and the Socialist
as a good second) in a total vote of
25,643,  a proportion which gives the
Jewish quarter a place among the least
corruptible districts in the city.
	If some immigrants have not the ad-
equate conception of the significance of
our institutions of which Senator Fair-
banks speaks, it is the American slum
politician who gives the newcomer les-
sons in that conception; and if it hap-
pens to be an object lesson in the form
of a two-dollar bill and a drink, the po-
litical organization which depends upon
such a mode of rolling up a big vote
is certainly as much to blame as the
ignorant bribe-taker.
	The ward heeler is as active in the
Ghetto as elsewhere. Aided by an army
of workers, which is largely made up
of the lowest dregs of the neighborhood,
he knocks, on election day, at the door
of every tenement house apartment,
while on the street the vote market goes
on in open daylight as freely as it did
before there was a Parkhurst to wage
war against a guilty police organization.
This statement is true of every destitute
district, and the Jewish quarter is no ex-
ception to the rule. As was revealed by
the Lexow committee, some of the lead-
ing district bosses in the great city, in-
cluding a civil justice, owe their power
to the political cotiperation of criminals
and women of the street. Unfortunately
this is also the case with the Jewish neigh-
borhood, where every wretch living on
the profits of vice, almost without excep-
tion, is a member of some political club
and an active worker for one of the
two machines, and where, during the
campaign, every disreputable house is
turned into an electioneering centre. If
the tenth ward has come to be called the
Klondike of the police, so much the
worse for the parties who are directly re-
sponsible for the evil which justifies both
that appellation and the name of Ten-
derloin, which is borne by a more pro-
sperous neighborhood than the Ghetto.
	The malady is painful enough, but it
is not the guilty politician from whom
the remedy is to be expected. As to
the Jewish quarter, the doctrine of self-
help is practiced by the workiugmen
politically as well as economically. In
proportion as the intelligence of the dis-
trict is raised by the thousand and one
educational agencies at work, the many
characteristics of the best citizens with
which Miss Van Etten was impressed
in the Jews of the East Side come to the
front, and the power of the corruption-
ist wanes.
	The immigration reformers dread of
foreign socialism is scarcely consistent
with his classification of the various na-
tionalities who immigrate in large num-
bers. To judge from the overwhelming
social - democratic vote in Germany, a
large proportion of the Germans who</PB>

come to our ports are socialists, and yet
they are placed at the very top of the
list of desirable immigrants. Moreover,
with some twenty states of the Union
officially recognizing the Socialist Labor
Party and printing its ballots, a crusade
against the doctrine by the government
xvould be a self-contradiction. Nor is it
true that socialism is a foreign importa-
tion. The two socialist aldermen in the
country (at Paterson, New Jersey, and
Haverhill, Massachusetts) were elected
by American workingmen; the new so-
cialist organization called the Social De-
mocracy is largely composed of Ameri-
cans, and makes converts among the na-
tive elements of the working class. The
Jewish immigrants, at all events, bring
no socialism with them; and if it is true
that the socialist following among Jewish
workingmen is considerable and is grow-
ing, they owe it to the economic condi-
tions which surround them here and to
the influence of the American socialist
with whom they come in cont~ct. Like
other socialists, they look to the ballot-
box for the changes which they advocate.
It is the Jewish socialist who leads the
neighborhood in its fight against the
political and moral turpitude which the
politician spreads in the tenement houses.
	The Jewish immigrants look upon the
United States as their country, and now
that it is engaged in war they do not
shirk their duty. They have contributed
three times their quota of volunteers to
the army, and they had their represent-
atives among the first martyrs of the
campaign, two of the brave American
sailors who were wounded at Cardenas
and Cienfuegos being the sons of Hebrew
immigrants.
	The Russian Jew brings with him the
quaint customs of a religion full of po-
etry and of the sources of good citizen-
ship. The orthodox synagogue is not
merely a house of prayer; it is an in-
tellectual centre, a mutual aid society, a
fountain of self-denying altruism, and a
literary club, no less than a place of
worship. The study-rooms of the hun-
dred~ of synagogues, where the good old
people of the Ghetto come to read and
discuss words of law as well as the
events of the day, are crowded every
evening in the week with poor street ped-
dlers, and with those gray-haired, misun-
derstood sweat-shop hands of whom the
public hears every time a tailor strike
is declared. So few are the joys which
this world has to spare for these over-
worked, enfeebled victims of the in-
ferno of modern times that their reli-
gion is to many of them the only thing
which makes life woith living. In the
fervor of prayer or the abandon of re-
ligious study they forget the grinding
poverty of their homes. Between the
walls of the synagogue, on the top floor
of some ramshackle tenement house,
they sing beautiful melodies, some of
them composed in the caves and forests
of Spain, where the wandering people
worshiped the God of their fathers at
the risk of their lives; and these and
the sighs and sobs of the Days of Awe,
the thrill that passes through the heart-
broken talith-covered congregation when
the shoffar blows, the mirth which !fllls
the house of God and the tenement
homes upon the Rejoicing of the Law,
the tearful greetings and humbled peace-
makings on Atonement Eve, the myste-
rious light of the Chanuccah candles,
the gifts and charities of Puriin, the
joys and kingly solemnities of Passover,
 all these pervade the atmosphere of
the Ghetto with a beauty and a charm
without which the life of its older resi-
dents would often be one of unrelieved
misery.
	How the sweat-shop striker and the
religious enthusiast are found in the
same person is an interesting question,
and the following little episode may not
be out of place.
	It was a late hour during the recent
strike of the Vest - Makers Union, and
the Jewish quarter was enveloped in
the quiet of night. As I made my way</PB>

through the market-place, a merry, bi-
zarre hubbub of singing voices broke
UI)0fl the stillness of the street. The
voices came from a tumble-down frame
house, and were traced to three tiny
low-ceiled rooms on the second floor.
A Holy Ark and a reading - desk beto-
kened the character of the place. The
little synagogue was crowded with be-
whiskered, pious, ragged old men. They
sat at long tables, swaying and nodding,
curling their side-locks or stroking their
beards, as they sang a joyous Sabbath
melody. Their faces shone and their
voices trembled with emotion. A dark-
eyed little girl of ten and her gaunt,
sallow-faced father were hovering about,
serving barley soup, cake, and beer to
the company.
	I am no waiter, explained the
gaunt man. I am a member, like the
others; but my wife prepared the feast,
and somebody must serve it, so my little
girl and I took the task upon ourselves.
We are a Mishnah class. We meet
every evening, after work, to study the
holy words, and now that we have con-
cluded the sixth tractate we celebrate
the event. Each of us has contributed
twenty-five cents, and so we are enjoy-
ing what the Uppermost has sent us.
What other delights are open to us in
this world ?
	The assemblage proved to be made
up of striking vest-makers. Yes, we
attended the meeting to-day, said a
shaggy, red-haired man, but you know
the saying, Half for yourselves and half
for your God. To-morrow we shall go
to the meeting again. Ours is a just
cause. It is for the bread of our chil-
dren we are struggling. We want our
rights, and we are bound to get them
through the union. Saith the Law of
Moses: Thou shalt not withhold any-
thing from thy neighbor nor rob him;
there shall not abide with thee the wages
of him that is hired through the night
nntil morning. So it stands in Leviticus.
So you see that our bosses who rob us
and who dont pay us regularly commit
a sin, and that the cause of our union is
a just one. What do we come to Amer-
ica for? To bathe in tears, and to see
our wives and our children rot in pover-
ty? Tears and sighs we had in plenty
in the old country.
	A frown had settled upon his face,
but it suddenly disappeared as he said,
with a wave of his hand: Well, this is
not the time to discuss matters such as
these. We have enough of them during
the day. This is our holy feast,  a
time for joy, not for woe. We have
concluded the sixth tractate, thank the
Uppermost.
	The shaggy vest-maker shut his eyes,
and with his features relaxed in a smile
of unfeigned bliss, he burst out singing
and snapping his fingers with the rest.

Shakespeares heroines whom any cow-
ard would die for, there are a scant score
of women in English literature whose
colors any one of us were proud to wear
against all corners. Di Vernon, Doro-
thea Brooke, Elizabeth Bennet, Lady
Castlewood, Katriona, and a dozen of
their kin make up the sum. Our mod-
em chivalry must have incentive. Our
imagination must be aroused. For im-
agination is not dead, but sleeping. It
slumbers soundly in the presence of the
excellent Marcella, dozes in the face of
Bathsheba Everdene, nods over Lord
Ormonts Aminta, and turns a deaf ear
to the melodious voice of Glory Quayle.
But let another Beatrix (oh that there
could be another!) come tripping down
the stair to meet us in a modern chapter,
wearing in our honor her white shoes and
her scarlet stockings, and imagination will
start up hotly enough at her approach.
	The heroine such as the imagination
cherishes has disappeared from our liter-
ature. Her place is filled by intelligent
young women of various types. They
are preferably serious. Then their forte
is religion and their foible philanthropy.
They probe the questions of society and
life, and become at once the subjects of
conversation in serious drawing-rooms.
But a heroine of this class is always sub-
ordinate in interest to her ideas. She is
impersonal, or her personality is obscured
by the bright halo of her intellect.
	Or again, the young woman is any-
thing but serious. She may, perhaps,
figure in one of Mr. Anthony Hopes ro-
mances. Surely she is not a heroine to
touch the imagination. Our attention
is riveted to the story. In the dove-
tailed succession of alarums, excursions,
entrances, retreats, adventures, esca-
pades, a few brisk words of love are our
only key to the ladys character. The
swift lunge and parry of her speech
amuse, but do not captivate. As we
close the book, we are on no nearer terms
with her than with some pretty actress
when the curtain is rung down.
	The heroine of to-day is most apt to be
a dramatic character. The story is pre-
ferably tragic. With grim determina-
tion, the novelist stretches his reader on
the rack, adjusts the thumbscrews, tight-
ens the iron boots. The proof of the
novel is in the pain it gives. With few
exceptions, the plot is one of two or
three established types. The inexpres~
sive She is separated from her lover
by the prejudices of caste, as in Mr.
Caine, or by the intolerance of parents,
as in Mr. Meredith. Or perhaps our
story-tellers solve to their own satisfac-
tion the problem so popular in the nov-
els of France, and ring the changes upon
Monsieur, Madame et lautre, as the
French critics say. Here the psycholo-
gist has free range. Conditions and con-
clusion must be scientific, no matter
about the reader. The pathos of the
story centres round the heroine. She
is dramatic, passionate, intense. But it
is not the intense, passionate, dramatic
woman whom we commonly grow fond
of in life. Why should she win us in
books? She may be interesting, touch-
ing, absorbing, bat that is quite a differ-
ent matter. Such cannot be the heroine
of our choice. Were her complexities
incarnate upon earth, as they may be in
a galaxy of women, should we follow
her? Surely. Admire her? Perhaps.
Love her? No,  a thousand times, no!
Her passion, beauty, and suffering might
conspire to insure the aim,
But it s innocence and modesty
That polishes the dart,

and we are proof against her enmity.
	Nothing is so elusive as feminine
charm. Photograph it, and you will not
find its counterfeit upon the plate. Print
it in books, and your description is cold
as the type that stamped the paper.
Only a few great artists have succeeded
in this most difficult of portraitures.
Whether it be Jane Austen or Ivan Tar-
guenieff who draws the picture, we love
and are grateful.
	That a novel without a heroine whom</PB>

we delight to think of is imperfect, few
will gainsay. In these days of novel-
writing and novel-reading, it is interest-
ing to notice how wide the author shoots
of the difficult mark. Yet if the novel-
ist holds up the mirror to life, great are
his opportunities. Mr. Henry James, in
a recent essay, comments upon the fresh
field offered by the modern business man,
	whose song has still to be sung, and his
portrait still to be painted. This is most
true, but how much vaster the. province
presented by the modern woman! Away
with the humdrum hackneyed models of
the past! Away with the Priscillas of
an outworn age! Let every novelist set
upon his marks, for surely his goal is
within sight.
	The progress of woman is evident on
every hand. Far be it from us to belit-
tle her advancing strides. Now, discard-
ing the thwarting skirt, she climbs the
Alps and lends a helping hand to the
lagging mountaineer. Now we hear of
her directing an army of sweepers and
cleansing the Augean streets of Chicago.
Now, scarcely pausing to vote, if we may
trust the papers, she rushes to mass-
meetings and proposes to join the Na-
tional Guard. If the existing uniform
must be altered, more s the pity, but
even so there will be something gained.
Or again, she enters the quieter walks of
life, and becomes a physician, lawyer, or
mere clergywoman. If your novelist is
still dissatisfied with these riches of ma-
terial, let him turn for his heroine to
the sweet girl-graduate. Think of
the plot of psychological problems which
can be made to thicken about her!
Armed from mortar-board to heel, she
can meet the hero on his own ground,
give him the choice of weapons, and beat
him roundly.
	Let the story-teller sweep the horizon
with his literary glasses. Everywhere
he will see the army of new women de-
manding recognition. Choice is invidi-
ous, but choose he must. Now at last
he can find a heroine worthy of his novel.
A novel, forsooth! Why, she would
queen it in an epic, while former heroes
flee to Dunciads!
	These are auspicious times for the
maker of heroiues. Well may he look
forward to the new century with confi-
dence in the approaching consummation
of his art. The development of the he-
roine will increase the scope of the plot.
The seductive villain will be thrown on
the defensive, and it is the hero who
will be won. The new heroine will be
masterful, accomplished, dazzling, if you
will, but will she charm? Will it be she
whom the young men of the next gener-
ation will wish to dream of? Will her
qualities go to make their ideals? Will
they reverse the novelists process, and
run to seek her likeness through the
world, or will they cling to the magic
memory of the few lovely portraits they
possess?
	The story-teller must pursue his de-
stiny. He will sketch the world about
him in flattery, caricature, or truth.
What will be the heroine of his choice?
An forward though I canna see,
I guess an fear.
	FROM the days of papyrus to the nine-
Concerning teenth century, when of the
Bibilomania. making of books there is no
end, biblioniania has affected mankind
in more or less intensified form. In-
effectually has it been diagnosed and
treated by bibliographs of all ages. Pei-
gnot defines it as a passion for possess-
ing books; not so much to be instructed
by them as to gratify the eye by look-
ing on them. He who is affected by
this mania knows books only by their
titles and dates, and is rather seduced
by the exterior than the interior.
	The symptoms of so virulent a disease
are not to be mistaken. They can be
instantly known, says Dibdin, by a pas-
sion for (1) large paper copies; (2) un-
cut copies; (3) illustrated copies; (4)
unique copies; (5) copies printed upon
vellum; (6) first editions; (7) true edi-
tions; (8) a general desire for the</PB>

black letter. I would add to these a
passion for (9) editions printed at private
presses; (10) editions privately bound.
	A characteristic of the disease is that
it succumbs to no known remedies. All
applications, external as well as inter-
nal, seem but to increase its fervency;
neither does poverty allay it, once the
craze is on. Many a one so afflicted has
gone starving to bed, transported by the
possession of an incunabulum for which
he has expended his last sou. No con-
dition, no age, is exempt, no climate. It
rages among royalty as among the com-
moner herd of humanity.
	French book - collectors, and notably
the mesdames de France, have displayed
peculiar and luxurious tastes in binding.
We are told that of the daughters of
Louis XV., Ad6laide affected red moroc-
co; Sophie, citron; and Victoire, olive.
Catharine de Medici was so great a con-
noisseur of finely bound books that au-
thors and booksellers tried to distinguish
themselves in bindings made expressly
for her. Such was their success that it
was deemed expedient, upon her death,
to strip the books of their ornate and cost-
ly dress, lest they should fall a prey to
her creditors. Marie Antoinette had a
library of upwards of five thousand vol-
umes in the Petit Trianon; and Ma-
dame de Pompadour, whose conduct was
not in every respect above criticism, must
surely be commended for her love of
books, as she was the possessor of three
thousand volumes. Her bookbinder was
no less a personage than the celebrated
Anton Michel Padeloup. Madame de
Maintenon, too, had rare and exquisite
taste in books and bindings; and enrolled
among book-lovers are to be found the
names of Marguerite dAngoul~me, Mar-
garet of Valois, Diana of Poitiers, as
ivell as the Duchesse de Montpensier,
La Grande Mademoiselle, the Mar-
quise de Montespan, and the Duchesse
du Berry. To them we owe some of the
finest examples of the bookbinders art.
The idiosyncrasies of their dispositions
we can almost forgive by reason of that
taste which to-day makes glad the heart
of the book-fancier.
	Nor do these names close the list of
bibliophilists. Charles the Bald was a
lover of books and learning. A Bible
was illuminated expressly for his pri-
vate use, and his love of learning often
carried him to royal extremes. The
story goes that one Johannes Erigena,
surnamed Scotus, a man renowned for
learning; sitting at table, in respect of
his learning, with Charles the Bauld,
Emperor and King of France, behaved
himselfe as a slovenly scholler, nothing
courtly; whereupon the Emperor asked
him merrily, Quid interest Scotum et
Sotuni? [What is there between a Scot
and a Sot?] He merrily, but yet mala-
pertly answered, Mensa [The table]; as
though the Emperor were the Sot, and
he the Scot.
	Of English book-lovers the name is
legion. Dibdin tells us that Richard de
Bury, tutor to Edward III., and after-
ward Bishop of Durham, was the first
affected. However this may be, certain
it is that he owned more books than all
the other bishops of England. Dean
Colet and Erasmus abetted the mania,
and Sir Thomas More was not exempt.
Queen Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey
were given over to bibliophilism; and
Henry VII. and James I., both book-
lovers, even attempted literary produc-
tion on their own account.
	Pepys, despite his feminine frailties,
was a collector of rare books; and sun-
dry kicks disposed gratuitously among
his servants, his flirtatious deportment
at church when full of years; his mal-
treatment of the partner of his joys and
sorrows, all these are of little moment
in comparison with that worthy love of
an old book, a rare book, a grave, in-
nocent book.
	His Grace the Duke of Roxburghe
conceived a passion for first editions.
It has been related with all due authen-
ticity that at a certain sale a first edition</PB>

of Shakespeare was offered. The dukes
friends were deputed to bid it in, while
he viewed the contest at a distance.
Twenty guineas and more had been of-
fered, when a slip was handed his Grace
asking if his friends should continue bid-
ding. The duke wrote in reply 
Lay on, Macduff,
And damnd be him that first cries, Hold,
enough!

It is needless to say that the duke be-
came the happy possessor of the folio.
	Undoubtedly, it is to the bookbinder of
the past that we owe in a very large de-
gree the extension of the mania. Such
exquisite workmen as Grolier, Maioli, Le
Gascon, DerOme, and Padeloup worked
for all time; and how amazed, not to
say dumfounded, would these worthies
be to behold the methods we employ to
supply the ever increasing demand for
books! Nowadays we preserve a book
of American manufacture, not for the
beauty of its binding, not for the tooling
on this one or that, not for the rare qual-
ity of the morocco, but, perchance, be-
cause it is a first edition of Hawthorne
or of Poes Tamerlane, or, what is more
than probable, because undue use would
soon end in its destruction, such is the
ephemeral nature of our art of to-day.
The signs, however, are propitious; and
when once we have recovered from ex-
treme youth, with its hurry and bluster
and unsophistication, then shall our ver-
satility be turned toward the arts, of
which not the least is the art of binding.
	The peculiar ideas in bookbinding are
many and curious. The Golden Ass of
Apuleius was once bound in asss skin;
a collection of pamphlets respecting one
Mary Tufts, reputed to have been con-
fined of rabbits, was sent forth to the
world in rabbit skin; Tuberville on Hunt-
ing was bound by Whittaker in deer
skin; Foxs historical works met the gaze
of humanity in fox skin, and Bacons
works in hog skin.
	On May 15, 1874, there was sold in
Paris, by auction, a part of the library of
M. Lucien de Rosuy, father of the emi-
nent Japanese scholar. Some of the
books, we are told, were bound in cat
skin colored garnet and buff; others in
the skins of the crocodile, royal tiger,
rattlesnake, seal, otter, white bear, and
Canadian black wolf. I confess to lit-
tle, if any, sympathy for the taste of M.
Lucien do Rosuy, authority in binding
though he may have been. How much
more healthful and normal that of him
who has written concerning his simple
wants: 
Of books but few,  souse fifty score
	For daily use, and bound for wear;
The rest upon an upper floor;
	Some little luxury there
Of red moroccos gilded gleam
And vellum rich as country cream.

	In addition to the many evils we lay
at the door of the French Revolution is
the morbid practice of binding in human
skin. What must have been the feel-
ings of that lady whose lover, a Russian
poet, is said to have presented her with
a volume of his sonnets bound in his
own skin, taken from an amputated leg!
More desirable by far, from a moral
point of view, as a salutary warning to
the young and to evil doers generally, was
the practice in vogue in the less enlight-
ened past of flaying criminals to obtain
materials for binding contemporary legal
documents. This recalls an edition of
The Newgate Calendar, being the me-
moirs of the most notorious characters
convicted of outrages on the laws of
England since the eighteenth century,
the binding of which was ornamented in
gold with designs suggestive of the con-
tents ; to wit, dark lanterns, masks, pis-
tols, handcuffs, shackles, and other re-
minders of crime. A public library in
Bury St. Edmunds contains a full ac-
count of the execution of a murderer, in
an octavo voh.une bound in the murder-
ers own skin by a surgeon of the town.
	A more elegant, and certainly a less
gruesome habiliment for a book was a
piece of the waistcoat of Charles I., in</PB>

which a volume was bound relating to
the dwarf Jeffrey Hudson. A copy of
the New Years Gift was appareled in a
like manner. With this the supply must
have been exhausted, since we read of no
further use being made of the garment.
	To the bibliognostic the following lines
from Popes Dunciad are eloquent with
meaning 
There Caxton sleeps with Wynkyn at his
side,
One	clasped in wood, and one in strong cow-
hide.

	Another fancy that obtained at an
early date was the insertion of jewels
into the bindings of books. St. Jerome
is said to have exclaimed, Your books
are covered with precious stones, and
Christ died naked before his temple
	By a law of March 24, 1583, Henry
III. of France forbids the bourgeois to
wear precious stones in their dress, but
such is the graciousness of his Majesty
he allows their books of devotion to be
adorned with diamonds, not exceeding
four, while the nobility are allowed five,
and the princes are not limited as to
number. It was the same monarch who,
when he instituted the order of Peni-
tents, invented a binding consisting of
the cheerful device of deaths - heads,
cross-bones, tears, crosses, and other in-
struments of the Passion, on black mo-
rocco, relieved, however, by the inscrip-
tion Spes inca Dens.
	Carlyle, it is said, had no love for
books per Se, and Darwin was not de-
terred by any sentimental notions of sac-
rilege from cutting an unwieldy volume
in two for easier manipulation. Not so
Petrarch, who would suffer the loss of a
leg rather than submit to such torture an
edition of the Epistles of Cicero, tran-
scribed by himself, and bound so mas-
sively as to be constantly falling upon
that unfortunate member. But Carlyle
was too sairously bent upon the re-
formation of humanity, and Darwin too
much absorbed in the origin of that hu-
manity, to have time for the indulgence
of a fancy so pertinacious as bibliophi-
lism. If a portion of the Iliad was found
in the hands of a mummy, think you it
was more precious in the eyes of Car-
lyle, the lover of great men,  Carlyle,
who styles the immortal Johnson the
withered pontiff of Encyclopa~dism? To
him books were of intrinsic worth only
for the soul and thought that were in
them. The value of Boswells Letters
was not enhanced in Temples eyes be-
cause they were discovered in a shop at
Boulogne in use for wrapping-paper; nor
of Sternes Diary in that it was found in
a plate - warmer. He was an admirer
of Luthers Table Talk, not because it
was unearthed from an old foundation,
wrapped in strong linen cloth, waxed
within and without, in which condition
it had lain since its suppression. And
so he writes: In books lies the soul of
the whole past; the articulate audible
voice of the past, when the body and
material substance of it has altogether
vanished like a dream. All that man-
kind has done, thought, gained, or been,
 it is lying as in magic preservation in
the pages of books. And again: Is
it not verily, at bottom, the highest act
of mans faculty that produces a book?
And as such the Sage of Chelsea rever-
enced it; not for any atmosphere of an-
tiquity that proceeded from it.
	But let me not seem to discourage the
bibhiomaniacs profession; this were the
part of no true bibliophile. Rather do
I say, Love a book !  in any way, whe-
ther its age, or dress, or thought appeals
to you, love it with all the ardor of your
soul.</PB></P>

THE OLD WORLD IN THE NEW.

	AT a French dinner-table, a few years
ago, I found myself opposite a genial
English clergyman who was somewhat
disturbed by the local tendency to quote
values and spaces in terms of francs and
centimes, metres and centimetres, instead
of in the old - established and well - ap-
proved pounds, shillings, and pence, feet
and inches. Some attempt was made to
interest him in the practical convenience
of the decimal system, and he gave po-
lite and patient hearing; but the seed
fell upon stony ground, where was no
deepness of earth, and its first fair pro-
mise soon withered away before an ap-
peal to the common consciousness of
man. I think, said the Englishman,
addressing his international audience,
everybody will have noticed that when
one has small sums to pay, francs and
centimes or dollars and cents do well
enough; but if any large sum is involved,
one is always forced, in order really to
appreciate the amount, to reduce it to
pounds, shillings, and pence.
	Socrates, in the Phn~do, compares the
people of his day, who thought their
world about the IEgean to be the whole,
to ants and frogs about a marshy pool.
The ants and the frogs we have ever
with us. They are antiquarians of Co-
penhagen to whom Danish history is the
history of the world. They are the
school committee men who insist that
Kansas schools should teach only Kan-
sas history and Kansas geography and
Kansas weather. They are the political
historians who make the world start
afresh with the Declaration of Independ-
ence. They are the financial experts
who ignore the existence of international
values. They are the three wise men
of Gotham who went to sea in a bowl.
All those who do not know that the ex-
perience of the race is one continuous
whole, in which dates and boundaries are
only guide-posts, and not barriers, are
the ants and frogs of Socrates. With-
out life perspective and historical per-
spective there can be no sound political
judgment,  least of all in these days,
when mighty world forces are twirling
the millstones of the gods, and the gar-
nerings of the ages are pouring into the
hopper.
	We are living in great times. Forces
that have been silently at work for cen-
turies are just finding their expression.
The closing years of the nineteenth cen-
tury are engaged in a process of histori-
cal liquidation by which the debtors and
creditors of the ages are coming to their
due. Scarcely have the echoes of the
last contest died away on the shores of
the IEgean, where has been the battle-
ground and ultimate clearing-house of
old world issues, when the new world
issues take their shape and choose their
battle-ground by the Chinese Ocean.
Through the trans-Siberian railway Rus-
sia this year finds for the first time an
outlet to the open sea, and enters the
lists for the empire of the world. The
bayonets which in the seventies estab-
lished a German Empire are now, under
cover of an understanding with Russia,</PB>

opening a way for German small wares erto known. Four years are not past,
in a conquest whose menace is toward and the dim vistas of futurity have
England. Ill-mated France shares with
Russia and Germany their policy of re-
stricted colonial markets, and toys with
colonizing schemes for which she has
more money and ambition than men.
The worn-out states and peoples of the
old world are passing through bank-
ruptcy. Africa is being rapidly appor-
tioned as spoil. The English Empire, in
consciousness of isolation and peril,
draws its own bonds closer, and awakes
to tardy recognition of its Western kins-
men, of their strength and of their kin-
ship of purpose. The United States of
America find themselves forced, whe-
ther they will or not, to transmute their
policy of resisting intrusion into one of
assuming the positive responsibilities of
a moral hegemony in the West. With-
in three years the entire strategic map
of international politics has been made
anew. Alsace-Lorraine and Constanti-
nople no longer represent the burning
questions of diplomacy. New issues and
vastly larger fields of action have been
opened. Three years ago, we felt that
our own international issues, so far as
they existed, had little relation to the
great worlds worry. To-day, we are,
for good or bad, in the midst of it all.
	Intercommunication and rapid transit
have been steadily drawing the ends of
the earth together. Silent, mighty forces
have long been assembling to the melt-
ing-pot the stubborn forms and patterns
of the older world. Suddenly the fire
is lighted.
	Lord Rosebery, while Premier of Eng-
land, made in Parliament the following
statement: We have hitherto been fa-
vored with one Eastern Question, which
we have always endeavored to lull as
something too portentous for our imagi-
nation; but of late a Far Eastern Ques-
tion has been superadded, which, I con-
fess, to my apprehension is in the dim
vistas of futurity infinitely graver than
even that question of which we have hith
become the arena of the present, and the
Far Eastern Question is at the doors of
England and at our own. It is a ques-
tion in which all 4he world is involved.
The centre of disturbance may be now
in China, now in Cuba, now in the Phil-
ippines, but the disturbances are all in
sympathy. It is a question in which the
whole history of our race is involved.
Its tangled movements viewed simply
in their shifting surface phases yield,
however, no intelligible statement. They
concern too vast an area, too long a tra-
dition; they cannot be understood from
the levels of the present. One must seek
high ground, for they tell their meaning,
they betray the outlines of their plot, only
in terms of the world labor,  the drama
of the history of the race. For great
areas and mighty upheavals the geologist
must run the gamut from Areh~an and
Cambrian to Pleistocene. To-day, in a
sense that never before was true, the old,
the oldest world of man is sole compe-
tent interpreter of the new.
	When in the year 326 B. c. Alexan-
der the Great stayed his eastward march
in northwestern India at the Sutlej, and
turned his course down the Indus to seek
the sea, a boundary line was fixed and
set which proved to mean for the history
of the human race more than any ever
created by the act of man. The eastern
boundary of Alexanders empire, running
from the Jaxartes River, a tributary of
the Sea of Aral, southward along the
Pamir ranges, the roof of the world,
to the Indus, and then on to the Indian
Ocean, divided the world and its history
into two utterly distinct parts.
	The portion which lay to theeast with
its two great centres, India and China,
and which to-day includes a little over
half the population of the globe, had no
lot nor share in the life and history of
the western part, which we may call our
Nearer World. In the long process of
mixture and fermentation which history</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00153" SEQ="0153" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="147">	The Old World in the New.	147
has suffered since Alexanders time, all
the elements within this Nearer World,
stretching from Afghanistan and Persia
to the shores of western Europe, have
yielded their contribution, small or great,.
to the civilization upon which our mod-
ern life is based. The history which
we study, whether of events, institutions,
ideas, or religions, has all been a history
of this Nearer World.
	India and China went their own way.
The Nearer World knew little of them,
gave little to them, received little from
them, until after the discovery of the
route around the Cape of Good Hope.
The intercourse opened by that narrow
way is, in the twentieth century, to tread
the three broad highways of the Suez
Canal, the trans - Siberian railway, the
Pacific route, which represent, respective-
ly, England, Russia, America. England,
by the Canadian Pacific, shares the Pa-
cific route, and she must soon open an-
other by rail from the Mediterranean to
the head of the Persian Gulf.
	Alexanders boundary was not a boun-
dary of race. It ran across the bands
of blood. A section of the Aryan race,
isolated behind its barriers, became the
dominant caste and the rulers of India,
and developed or administered there a
form of life and thought utterly distinct
from any other product of the Aryan tem-
per. It was a boundary set in the his-
toric life of man. How real it was the
distribution of the great religious faiths
of the world will tell. Political institu-
tions and boundaries fade and shift; no-
thing human yields so permanent a map
as faith. The conquests of religions are
chiefly those of name and outward form.
Unless the population changes, the faith
in substance abides.
	To the east of Alexanders boundary
will be found Hinduism, Buddhism, Con-
fucianism; to the west, two systems born
out of the soil of Alexanders empire,
one of the west, Christianity, the other
of the east, Mohammedanism,  both of
them, in history and outward guise of
statement, the products of Semitism. If
a map of the world should be colored
so as to represent the predominant re-
ligions of different regions, it would ap-
pear that Mohammedanism reaches its
eastern frontier essentially at the line
drawn from the Jaxartes along the
roof of the world and down the
course of the Indus; that is, at Alexan-
ders old frontier. Its territory repre-
sents the oriental or non-occidental por-
tion of Alexanders empire. It is itself
merely a second growth on western
Asiatic soil, a revival and reassertion of
orientalism in the reaction from Euro-
pean conquest. And yet, when com-
pared with the fundamental thought of
the systems grown in India and China,
it shows itself a creation of our world,
and not of the remoter one.
	Upon our colored map we should find,
further, that the territory of Eastern
Christianity corresponds in general to
the sphere of influence of ancient Athens
and Byzantium; that the territory of Ro-
man Catholicism corresponds to the do-
main of the Western Roman Empire, 
Italy, the Spanish Peninsula, France,
and the Rhine and Danube valleys of
Central Europe; while the old Germani,
who withstood the legions of Drusus and
Varus, are represented still by the indi-
vidualistic Protestants of the north.
	The civilization of the Nearer World
had its birth in the two centres Egypt
and Babylonia. It was in the long
river valleys of the Nile and the Eu-
phrates that the two types of ordered
life we call by the names Egyptian and
Assyrian gained their strength and their
individuality. Their meeting-place and
agora was the eastern Mediterranean,
its coast lands and islands. Here the
resultant of the Mesopotamian and
Egyptian civilizations united as a female
principle with the virility of European
occidentalism, and the fruit was that civ-
ilization upon which European history,
and all the history we have hitherto
cared for, is based.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00154" SEQ="0154" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="148">	148	The Old World in the New.
	Consciousness of the power of individ-
ual initiative has been throughout the
characteristic feature in occidentalism;
passive conformity to the ordinance of
fate and the settled order of the world,
the spirit of orientalism. The West is
aggressive, the East passive; the West
finds the source of creation and action
in the individual, the East in the govern-
ing power, be it state or fate. The West
looks outward, and seeks to comprehend
and control the material universe of its
environment; the East looks within, and,
learning from the winds and the stars
only the lessons of moral order and the
mandates of destiny imposed upon the
soul, seeks to know and control the things
of the spirit.
	In this fabric of the Nearer World
joined of the West and the East, the
East supplied the informing spirit, the
ordered life, the civilization; the West,
the moving will and the arm of power-
First Greece, then Rome, then in their
turn the peoples of the north, assumed
the leadership. Fresh blood of will and
empire was drawn constantly from the
north. But, however empire might
change, the old frontier between the
West and the nearer East tended to
maintain itself where it was when his-
tory dawned,  at the A~gean and the
Bosporus. Two years ago all eyes
were turned toward the ZEgean. Crete,
Greece, Constantinople, and the Turk
were words on every lip. All issues of
international politics were quoted solely
in terms of the old Bosporus question.
The history of the Nearer World had
simply gone back for another bout on
the old field,  the field on which the
first contests were fought, and to which
most of the contests since have been re-
ferred in real or spectred battle.
	Viewing history in the large, we can-
not fail to see that the world we live
in is essentially a Mediterranean world.
All its fundamental forms and moulds
for law and government, art, architec-
ture, and literature, thought and faith,
were created beside the Mediterranean;
all its political and religious struggles,
all its wars, were the fighting over of
old Mediterranean questions; and as a
system of types and forms, it never can
be really understood and known except
as it be reduced to Mediterranean terms,
and studied in the perspective of a Ro-
man, Greek, or Syrian horizon.
	Such was the life habit of the Near-
er World. To-day all this has changed.
Suddenly the centre of interest has
shifted from the ~gean to the Yellow
Sea. A class of questions has arisen,
overwhelming, in the magnitude of the
issues they involve, all the great ques-
tions of earlier days, and none of them
admits solution in terms of the Medi-
terranean; none of them concerns the
Mediterranean, or its peoples, or its
history~ That which the silent course
of events has long been preparing, now
in the fullness of time is come. Almost
without a sign of warning we are trans-
ferred from the history of the Nearer
World to the history of the Great
World, and to that history the life and
the interests of the great dominant peo-
ples of the earth will hereafter belong.
	To no people is the transition of more
profound and fundamental importance
than to the people of the United States.
It involves for them nothing less than a
rethinking of the entire problem of na-
tional purpose, destiny, and duty.
	The old history, which we have called
the history of the Nearer World, dealt
with the antagonisms and the blending
of its two component factors, occidental-
ism and orientalism; the new history
will record the process of assimilation
which follows the uniting of the two
halves of the whole world. There can
be no question as to which of the two
will conquer and control, according to
the external forms of conquest; but it
is idle for us, in the light of historical
experience, to imagine that the blending
is to mean nothing more than the absorp-
tion of the East by the West,  nothing</PB>

more than the exploitation of China and
India by the greed and power, or even
the enlightenment, of Western nations.
Rome conquered Greece, but was con-
quered by its art, its manners, and its
thought. Europe, in the form of Greece,
and then of Rome, subjugated Asia; but
Asiatic wealth and luxury reshaped Eu-
ropean life, and Europe has its religion
from the conquered people. We may
easily underestimate the solidity of these
civilizations we confront, and the perma-
nence of their forms of life arid of their
moulds of thought. The economic con-
ditions, the political ideas, and the funda-
mental religious and philosophic thought
of our world cannot and will not escape,
in the great leveling that is to come, the
most far-reaching and momentous trans-
formation. England has touched yet
only the surface of India, merely the hem
of the garment; but her commerce, the
equipment of her life, her governniental
mechanism and ideals, have already been
radically influenced, and the marvelous
effect which acquaintance with Hindu
thought is exercising upon mens funda-
mental thought of the world has spread
far beyond the circles of the learned and
of the faddists, and, I am persuaded, can
be estimated in its profound importance
only by the historians of later days.
	Both Jndia and China embody types of
life and forms of thought which, strange
and incomprehensible as they may be to
us, have been shapen and polished in
the mills of a human experience repre-
senting in composite the experience of
more human souls than have elsewhere
shared a common life.
	India is the land of the vast and the
boundless, the true motherland of the ro-
mantic. Endlessly prolific, she sets no
restraint on the imagination. So India
lacks that which was to the Greek, a~ the
representative occidental, the supremest
virtue, temperate control,  naught to
excess. The tumid, redundant forms
of her art, as of her literature and her
theogony, attest the absence of that sense
of due economy and fitness which made
the creations of the Greek eternal models
of restraint and harmony. To the ag-
gressive occidental, time is the opportu-
nity of action, time is money; for the
Hindu, there were no days or years, and
hence no history.
	The occidental is a pluralist; person-
alities, individual psyches, are for him
the starting-points, the prime factors of
the universe; to enforce personality and
make it effective is the mission of life.
The Hindu is a monist; the world-all
is the starting-point; personality is an
aberration from it; to bring this person-
ality back to rest, absorbed into accord
with the world-all, is the toil and mission
of life. Knowledge is the recipe of sal-
vation; ignorance is the sin.
	China is another cosmos. It is pre-
eminently the land of the practical. Its
world is the established social order of
men fixed in forms and conventions,
whose authority is absolute, as their rea-
sons are past finding out. Life is a
drama. Men merely play parts. The
look-see (appearance) and the make-
see (delusive persuasion) constitute the
substance of life. The starting-point and
whole of things is neither the world-all
nor the individual soul, but the stage and
scenery and plot into which the individ-
ual must fit the action of his part, and
within which take his rOle. There is no
truth, no real.
	With the Greek it is intemperance or
slopping over which is the sin, with
the Hindu ignorance, with the Chinaman
innovation. The purpose of education
is, for the Greek, to give personality
its maximum of effectiveness; for the
Hindu, to endow it with a knowledge
that shall reveal the hindrances to union
with the world-all; for the Chinaman,
to force the individuality, like a Chinese
girls foot into a shoe, into the fixed rOle
or craft it must use in this present life.
The Greek education is frankly the lib-
eral education; the Chinese, frankly pro-
fessional and technical.</PB>

	China has perhaps one fourth the pop-
ulation of the globe, but no one suspects
it of schemes of imperial conquest. The
yellow danger menacing the world
comes not from the thrifty tradesmen
and peasants of China. China is a na-
tion without a fist. Its people are lack-
ing in any idea or motive around which
could be assembled the sentiments of pa-
triotism. Devotion to the honoring of
ancestors and solicitude for private gain
are the two sentiments of a people who
constitute, not a nation nor a state, but a
scheme of living.
	The new history is to be concerned,
then, with the assimilation of these two
strange and mutually diverse elements of
the farther world to the substance of the
nearer world,  just as the old world
history involved an assimilation of West
and East. With the parallel goes also a
contrast. The old history centred about
an inland sea. All its issues had their
ultimate home by the Mediterranean.
In the new history the world is turned
wrong side out. The outer ocean is the
agora. Power is estimated in terms of
navies rather than of armies. Coal is
king, and coaling-stations mark the bonds
of empire as the Roman military roads
did of old. The pattern of the world
has been turned inside out. The old
world, like an ancient house, was built to-
ward the inside and its colonnaded court;
the new is built toward the outside, with
windows and veranda.
	The old history had its Eastern Ques-
tion; the new has its Easternmost Ques-
tion. In the later phases of the old,
Turkey was the sick man; in the
new, it is China; and where the car-
cass is, there are the eagles gathered to-
gether. The old involved the constant
query who should be the leader of the
occident,  Greece, Rome, France, Ger-
many, England, Russia? The new asks
who shall hold the empire and lead the
civilization of the world; shall it be the
Slav, the Teuton, or the Latin?
	The aggressiveness shown by France
in colonial enterprise is scarcely more
than artificial; it represents no inner
need or impulse except as it be a yearn-
ing for bonds and shares. France is
really smitten with the palsy of her own
prudence and thrift. Families are small.
Sons are not put through the school of
self-reliance. A nation lacking men who
know how to take risks and assume the
responsibility of their own choices can-
not compete for leadership among the
peoples. French is the language of a
diplomacy which lives on in the close at-
mosphere of the old Mediterranean con-
troversies; out in the breezy ocean world,
the greater world, the medium of inter-
national intercourse tends to be English.
	A colder-blooded people than any of
the Latin race will win the contest, in
these days of organization and calcula-
tion and mechanism and coal. The Ger-
man is patient enough and practical
enough. He is, like his Anglo-Saxon
brother by nature, a stout champion of
individual freedom, but lie lacks some-
thing his brother possesses. This some-
thing it is not easy to describe, but the
lack of it allows him to tolerate the yoke
of C~esarism, imported from the Latin
world; gives him ready adaptability to
the institutions of other peoples, so that
he is quickly absorbed; and, most char-
acteristic of all, forbids his appreciation
of a game like football.
	The character in which the English-
man asserts his right to rule an empire
is the character demanded by this most
truly Anglo-Saxon sport. It is made up
of roughness, willingness to risk, ahsence
of supersensitiveness, fearful directness,
and a sublime devotion to fair play. The
typical Englishman believes in venturing,
hard hitting, blunt truth-telling, equal
justice, and personal cleanliness.
	England had the start of Continental
Europe in preparing for the issues of the
new history, in that the English Chan-
nel enabled her to free herself early from
the more baneful entanglements of the
Mediterranean quarrels. England has</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00157" SEQ="0157" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="151">	The Old World in the New.	151

long been living in the world whose
agora is the open seas. Not until these
last days of the nineteenth century, how-
ever, has her one prospective rival, Rus-
sia, been able to find a way out into the
world. This vast power, spanning at
the north half the globe, was until this
year pent up as an inland state. Arch-
angel and the Baltic ports are ice-blocked
for a portion of the year. Yladivostok,
founded in 1858, and afterward selected
as a terminus for the Siberian railway, is
closed to navigation four months in each
year. Odessa is blocked at the Bosporus.
	England has diligently kept the barri-
ers up between Russia and the sea. In
1878 she checked her at the gates of
Constantinople; in 1886, when Russia
was in control of the passes of the Hin-
du-Kush, and could see her way out to
the ocean by way of Afghanistan, Brit-
ish power again raised the dykes, and
since then the occupation by England of
the Mekran and the Chitral valley has
set a double rampart against Russian ad-
vance. It remains yet for England to
occupy the Persian Gulf, and join it by
rail to the coast where Beaconsfield set
Cyprus on guard.
	The events attending the Chinese-
Japanese war were of most serious con-
sequence to Englands policy and .inter-
est. Before the war began, she was the
trusted adviser of China, and her pro-
tector against Russian aggression. Be-
fore the war ended, England found her-
self identified with Japan, a nation she
had underestimated too long, and sud-
denly came to appreciate. Russia, sup-
ported by her associates, Germany and
France, assumed the r6le of protecting
friend discarded by England, checked
and nullified the victory of Japan, and
China is now almost her vassal. That
which it has been the constant aim of
English diplomacy and power for years
to prevent has come about within this
year. Russia has a harbor in the Yel-
low Sea, has gained a foothold on the
shore of the iceless ocean. The astute-
ness of Li Hung Chang, on the other
hand, has seen the way for bringing the
product of Chinese industry to the West-
ern world by the overland route, and
China is to be introduced to the West by
help and intermediation of Russia. Here-
in lies the quid pro quo.
	Russias strength is in her geographic
position. Unmenaced in the rear, span-
ning Europe and Asia, and knowing no
difference between them, she bides her
time, and slowly pushes her way south
like a mighty glacier. Gradually the
barriers give way. Germany, which once
held her in check at the west, is now 
thanks to Bismarcks anti-English policy,
continued by the young Emperor  in
league with her and in commercial war
with England. In Continental diplomacy
she is supreme arbiter. Panslavism and
the Eastern Church have carried her
around Constantinople almost to the
shores of the ZEgean, and the first oppor-
tunity of Englands preoccupation will
give her exit through the Bosporus.
Steadily she works her way into Central
Asia, where the half-oriental temper of
her people makes her government pecu-
liarly acceptable, and her administration
in general fortunate and wise.
	Entered in the lists for the world
empire are, then, these two. The con-
flict is set for which generations have
been preparing. Where is our place?
Russia is our old-time friend. When-
ever we have been at issue with Eng-
land, Russia has lost no opportunity to
show synipathy with us. England is a
mother who has constantly ignored or
underestimated us. With a blindness
of vision almost unparalleled in all the
stupidities of statesmanship, her ruling
class have committed wrong after wrong
against us, in slight and misjudgment and
selfishness, all culminating in the attitude
toward us during the war for the pre-
servation of the Union. But the heart
of the great English middle class has
always been right. The English com-
mon man, with a fine consciousness of</PB>

affinity, regards us as his own, and re-
joices in the American states as a crea-
tion and vindication of his own kind.
The English country squire is fading
away, and the plain commoner is com-
ing to a hearing. And we are of one
kind. When the battle is set between
the Slav and the Anglo-Saxon, our hearts
prove us inheritors of more than Anglo-
Saxon blood: we are inheritors of the
principles embodied in Anglo-Saxon life.
	The Slav stands for government which
has the sanctions of its authority from
above and without; the Anglo-Saxon, for
one whose authority has its source in
the governed themselves. One follows
the rule of expediencies, and holds that
what succeeds is right; the other builds
solid achievement on the things that are
real, and believes in the blunt word of
truth. One raises the barriers of re-
stricted privilege; the other opens the
markets and the courts of the world to
equal opportunity and even justice. One
builds on the distrust of the purposes
and the intelligence of men; the other,
upon the high optimism of democracy.
To one the state is a prison or strait-
jacket; to the other it is the training
school of the race, where responsibility
begets character, and free opportunity
begets content.
	There can be no doubt of our sympa-
thy,  what is our duty? Has the new
order of the world brought us new obli-
gations of duty? The old world linger-
ing in the meshes of Mediterraneanism
afforded us no interests but such as we
might well wish to shun with all their en-
tangling alliances. The barrier of the
ocean removed us from the old world
gathered about its inland sea, and set us
apart in the far West at one side of the
earth. The utilization of this barrier
has afforded us the opportunity for es-
tablishing ourselves in possession and use
of our soil, and for developing our re-
sources and our system of government.
	But now the old world has passed.
History is turned inside out. The outer
ocean is the agora; the whole world, not
half, is involved; and instead of being,
as in the old order of things, far at one
side, we stand full in the midst,  mid-
way between Europe and its goal in the
Farther East. Sooner than any pro-
phet could have foreseen, the question is
upon us.
	Our old-time policy of resisting arbi-
trary European interference in the af-
fairs of American peoples has been ex-
tended, under the pressure of what we
believe is a genuine humanitarian senti-
ment, into intervention against a Euro-
pean misgovernment in Cuba which had
passed the limits of toleration, and, hav-
ing ceased to be government, had become
a case of arbitrary interference in the
course of American events.
	The moment we took this step we be-
came involved in the great world pro-
blems. Englands position in the Far
East hurried her to our side, and gave us
her welcome to participation in wider
responsibilities for the order of the world.
England and America, alienated in terms
of the Nearer Worlds life, have found
each other on the field of the Greater
World. They belong together, and their
union means not only a check to the Rus-
sian menace, but peace and the orderly
development of civilization in the world.
	Many of us deplored the Spanish war;
many of us now look forward with anx-
ious solicitude concerning the effect of
victory on the victor; but still, as we
survey the movements of human history
in the large, we cannot fail to see in all
that is occurring the inevitable grist of
the mills of the gods and the irrefragable
judgments of the Weltgericht. Spain
and the Middle Ages could not tarry in
the West. We, on the other hand, could
not shut ourselves within the walled gar-
dens of our pleasant domesticity, and
shun responsibilities that the commerce
and intercourse of the larger world ex-
act of those who stand for order and
equal justice in the affairs of men.
	While, then, we may well be called</PB>

upon now to readjust our conception of
national purpose and duty to the new
order and our new position, we dare not
be false to ourselves or our past. Our
charter and creed we must interpret, if
no longer in the letter, then all the more
scrupulously in the spirit. However the
letter and the form may fade and vanish
away, there are some things that must

ernment of the people and for the peo-
ple cannot impose on conquered peoples
a foreign sway, or one that finds its su-
preme motive in the benefits accruing to
others than the governed. We must
stand as we were founded, a nation that
draws diverse interests and diverse coin-
munities into peaceful cotiperation under
recognition of the rights of the individual
man, and the self-government of peoples
and states.
	Conquest and empire, and all that be-
longs thereto both of method and of idea,
are utterly abhorrent to the theory of
those institutions through which America
has aspired to enlighten the world, and
utterly foreign to the structure our f a-
thers reared out of their stony griefs and

as in individuals. Only in loyalty to the
old can we serve the new; only in un-

and use the present; for history is not
made, but unfolded, and the old world
entire is ever present in the new.

THE TREND OF THE CENTURY.

	EVERY century has its own character-
istics. The two influences which have
made the nineteenth century what it is
seem to me to be the scientific spirit
and the democratic spirit. Thus, the
nineteenth century, singularly enough,
is the great interpretative century both
of nature and of the past, and at the
same time the century of incessant and
uprooting change in all that relates to
the current life of men. It is also the
century of national systems of popular
education, and at the same time of na-
tion-great armies; the century that has
done more than any other to scatter
men over the face of the earth, and to
concentrate them in cities; the century
of a universal suffrage that is based
upon a belief in the inherent value of
the individual; and the century of the
corporation and the labor union, which
in the domain of capital and of labor
threaten to obliterate the individual. I
want to trace, if I can, what has been
the trend of this remarkable century in
the domain of thought, of society, of
commerce, of industry, and of politics.

the trend of this remarkable century in
the domain of thought, of society, of
commerce, of industry, and of politics.
Especially I want to do this as it con-
cerns life in the United States.
	I speak first of the trend of thought;
for thought, immaterial though it be, is
the matrix that shapes the issues of life.
The mind has been active in all fields
during this fruitful century; but, outside

vidual observers and students of nature
in all ages. The seed idea is to be found
at least as far back as the time of Ba-
con, not to say of Aristotle. But it is
true that only in this century has this
attitude toward nature become the uni-
form attitude of men of science. The
results that have flowed from this gen-
eral attitude toward nature have been
so wonderful that the same method has
been employed by students of other sub-
jects, with results hardly less noteworthy.
To this attitude on the part of men of
science toward nature we owe the great
advances in our knowledge of natural
law which this century has witnessed;
and from this increased knowledge of
natural law the manifold inventions have
come that have changed the face of the
world. To the scientific method applied
to the problems of the past, by men of
letters, we owe our ability to understand
the hieroglyphs of Egypt and the cunei-
form inscriptions of Babylonia.
	One of the chief results of the scien-
tific method as applied to nature and
the study of the past is the change that
it has wrought in the philosophic con-
ception of nature and of human society.
By the middle of the century, Darwin
had given what has been held to be sub-
stantial proof of the theory of the de-
velopment of higher forms out of lower
in all living things; and since then, the
doctrine of evolution, not as a body of
exact teaching, but as a working theory,
has obtained a mastery over the minds
of men which has dominated all their
studies and all their thinking. The con-
sequences of the doctrine have been very
different in different fields of mental ac-
tivity. In the field of religious thought
it has undoubtedly been a source of very
serious perplexity, because it has con-
fronted men with the necessity of re-
shaping their conceptions of the divine
method of creation according to a theory
exactly the opposite of that which had
been previously held. When Coperni-
cus, in the sixteenth century, began to
teach that the earth revolved about the
sun, it must have seemed to be doctrine
that disputed the most evident of facts.
All men in all ages had seen the sun
rise in the east and set in the west, and
therefore the new doctrine must have
appeared, at first sight, to be utterly sub-
versive both of the science of that day
and of the religion of that day. The
men of science, then as now, easily ac-
commodated themselves to the new teach-
ing as its truthfulness became clear, de-
spite its revolutionary character, for to
them it meant only a fresh start along a
more promising road; but the opposi-
tion of the Church reveals the agony of
mind that was involved for the Christian
believer, in the effort to restate his con-
ception of mans importance in the sight
of God from the point of view of the
newly recognized truth, instead of from
the point of view of the old error. Still,
men have been able to do this, though
it took them a long time to do it. The
discovery of Copernicus was announced
in 1543; yet I read the other day, in
the life of Samuel Johnson, the first
president of Kings College in New York
city, that it was by him and his col-
leagues of Yale, in the early part of the
eighteenth century, that even the learned
people of Connecticut were led to accept
the Copernican theory of the universe
instead of the Ptolemaic. Indeed, so
late as the first Commencement of Kings
College, in 1758, one of the students, in
a clear and concise manner, deinonstrat-
ed the revolution of the earth round the
sun, both from astronomical observa-
tions and the theory of gravity, and de-
fended the thesis against two of his
classmates. These incidents illustrate
happily, by the way, how far America
was from Europe in those days. It is
easy to believe, therefore, that the evo-
lutionary conception of creation, with its
sublime suggestion of the limitless pos-
sibilities of endless development, will in
time be accepted as the basis of mens
religious thinking as universally as re</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00161" SEQ="0161" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="155">	The Trend of the Century.	155

ligious men now accept the Copernican
system of the universe. In the mean-
while, it should be a source of comfort
to every man whose mind has been trou-
bled by this new teaching of science that,
in this experience, nothing has happened
to him which has not happened before;
and it may be observed that if the man
of science has thus taught, in a new way,
that man is allied to the beasts that per-
ish, he has also shown, by his own wide
reading of naturallaw, that man is capa-
ble of tracing the processes of the in-
finite, thus setting the seal of science to
the doctrine of revelation, that man, in
his essence, is the child of God.
	The effect of the scientific method and
of the doctrine of evolution upon philo-
sophy, during the century, has been to
bring the philosopher and the man of
science closer together. In ancient times
the philosopher was in his own person a
man of science; that is to say, he not
only knew all of the science that was
known, but he was himself th~ princi-
pal agent in advancing mans scientific
knowledge. Through the centuries, as
mans knowledge of nature has increased,
one science after another has been set
aside from the domain of philosophy, so
to speak, as a field apart. Thus, as-
tronomy, physics, and chemistry have
long been recognized as independent
fields of knowledge; and the philosopher
has left it to the astronomer, the physi-
cist, and the chemist to enlarge mans
knowledge in those fields. During the
nineteenth century even psychology has
become, to a great extent, an experi-
mental science, so that philosophy, in
our day, has come to concern itself once
more with all knowledge rather than with
special fields of knowledge. Accord-
ingly, we find the greatest philosophers
basing their philosophies upon the widest
possible survey of facts; and the great-
est scientists turning from their facts to
account for them, as they may, by some
adequate philosophy. Thus, the theory
of evolution, resting as it does upon the
observed facts of nature, has come to
dominate the philosophy of the century
no less than its science.
	In the domain of education one sees
the same philosophy at work, having for
its handmaid the democratic tendency
which has marked the political devel-
opment of the century. Every public
educational system of our day, broadly
speaking, is the child of the nineteenth
century. The educational system of Ger-
many, which in its results has been of
hardly less value to mankind than to
Germany itself, dates from the recon-
stitution of the German universities after
the battle of Jena. Whatever system
France may have had before the Revo-
lution went down in the cataclysm that
destroyed the ancient r6gime, so that
the educational system of France also
dates from the Napoleonic period. In
the United States, while the seeds of the
public school system may have been
planted in the eighteenth, or perhaps
even in the seventeenth century, it has
only been in the nineteenth century, with
the development of the country, that our
public school system has grown into
what we now see; while in England, the
system of national education, in a demo-
cratic sense, must be dated from 1870.
This attempt on the part of the great
nations to provide systematic instruction
for the people, from childhood to man-
hood, from the elementary school to the
university, reflects, as it seems to me,
the commingling of the two great ten-
dencies of the century, the democratic
and the evolutionary. Out of the growth
of the democratic principle has come
the belief that it is worth while to edu-
cate all the children of the state; and
out of the scientific method, which has
led to the general acceptance of the evo-
lutionary theory, has been developed the
advance in educational method which is
so marked a feature of the last decades
of the century. Formerly, it was satis-
factory to educate a child according to
some preconceived theory, or as it had</PB>

always been done. To-day, the best
systems of education are increasingly
based upon the laboratory method, and
upon the observation of facts relating to
childhood and youth. The new disci-
plines, also, are freely admitted on even
terms with the old.
	In other domains of knowledge, such
as history and literature, the application
of the scientific method has resulted not
only in the overthrow of many of our pre-
conceived conceptions in regard to the
past, but also in the opening up of vast
fields of information which formerly were
closed to the seeker after truth, because
he did not command the open sesame
to its treasures. I think, therefore, the
statement is justified which I made at
the beginning of this paper, that it is to
science we must look for the thoughts
which, in the nineteenth century, have
dominated and fructified all other think-
ing. The illumination of the century has
proceeded from that source, and the light
that has been shed especially by the study
of nature has been carried into every
nook and corner of human history and
human life.
	But the consequences of the general
scientific attitude toward nature which is
characteristic of this century have been
twofold. Not only has the scientific
method furnished a philosophy of na-
ture and of human life, but, by the great
increase in mans knowledge of natural
law to which it has led, it has resulted
in endless inventions, and these, in turn,
have changed the face of the world. It
is not my purpose to catalogue these in-
ventions,  not even the most conspicu-
ous of them. I rather want to point
out some of the changes in the life of
society which have been caused by them.
One of the most noticeable of these re-
sults is the great increase in the number
and size of cities. What the elevator
is to the high building the railroad and
the steamboat are to the city. They
make practicable a city such as without
them could not be. In striking contrast
with this tendency of people to concen-
trate in cities, we observe, on the other
hand, a world movement of people which
has been facilitated by the same inven-
tions. Mans knowledge of the earth
that he inhabits has been made substan-
tially complete during the present cen-
tury, and the ends of the earth and the
islands of the sea have been brought
into rapid and easy communication with
the centres of the worlds life. In other
ages, tribes often migrated from one part
of the world to another. The path by
which they went was stained with blood,
and the country of which they took pos-
session they made their own by violence
and conquest. But in this century, mil-
lions of people, not as tribes, but as fam-
ilies and as individuals, have migrated
peacefully from Europe to America, to
Australia, to Asia, and to Africa. This
world-wide movement of the peoples has
been made possible only by the inven-
tions that have built up the cities; but it
also reflects, as it seems to me, the influ-
ence of the democratic spirit urging men,
in vast numbers and upon their own re-
sponsibility, always to seek for conditions
of life in which they may enter upon lifes
struggle less handicapped by the past.
	The rapid progress of invention during
the century has been coincident with one
far-reaching change in the habits of so-
ciety, the importance of which is seldom
recognized. I refer to deposit banking.
Of all the agencies that have affected the
world in the nineteenth century, I am
sometimes inclined to think that this is
one of the most influential. If deposit
banking may not be said to be the result of
democracy, it certainly may be said that
it is in those countries in which demo-
cracy is most dominant that deposit bank-
ing thrives best. The first bank in the
United States was the Bank of Mary-
land, opened in Baltimore in 1790. It
was open for a year before it had a de-
positor. Even fifty years ago the dis-
cussions of bankers turned mainly upon
circulation. Very little attention was</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00163" SEQ="0163" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="157">	The Trend of the Century.	157
given to the question of deposits. At
the present time our banks are coinpar-
atively indifferent to circulation; but
they aim to secure as large deposits as
possible. Deposit banking does for the
funds of a country precisely what mobi-
lization does for the army of a country
like France. Mobilization there places
the entire manhood of the country in read-
iness for war. Deposit banking keeps
every dollar of the country on a war foot-
ing all the time. Some one has said that
it would have been of no use to invent
the railroad, the submarine cable, or the
telephone at an earlier period of the
worlds history, for there would have
been no money at command to make any
one of them available before this modern
banking system had made its appearance.
If this be so, then indeed the part that
has been played by deposit banking in
the developments of the century cannot
be overestimated.
	During the century the conditions of
the worlds commerce have been radically
altered. It is not simply that the steam-
boat and the locomotive have taken the
place of the sailing-ship and the horse;
that the submarine cable has supplanted
the mails; nor even that these agencies
have led to such improvements in bank-
ing facilities that foreign commerce is
done, for the most part, for hardly more
than a brokerage upon the transaction.
These are merely accidents of the situ-
ation. The fundamental factors have
been the opening up of virgin soil in vast
areas to the cultivation of man, and the
discovery of bow to create artificial cold,
which makes it possible to transport for
long distances produce that only a few
years ago was distinctly classed as per-
ishable. The net result of these influ-
ences has been to produce a world coin-
petition at every point of the globe, both
on a scale never before known, and as re-
gards articles that have been heretofore
exempt from all competition except neigh-
borhood competition. Thus, not only has
it become impossible to raise wheat pro-
fitably in England or even on our own
Atlantic coast, but the price of such an
article as butter, for example, in the state
of New York, is fixed by what it costs
to produce a similar grade of butter in
Australia. Under the influence of these
changes, the merchant of the early part
of the century has become as extinct as
the mastodon. But if these changes
have introduced new and strange pro-
blems for the merchant, they have also
presented problems of no less difficulty
to the statesman. In the first half of the
century, China was the great source of
supply for both tea and silk. At the
present time, more than half of the tea
consumed in England comes from India
and Ceylon, and more than three quar-
ters of the tea consumed in the United
States comes from the island of Formo-
sa and from Japan. Even in silk China
has largely lost her market to Japan
and Europe. Who shall say that this
gradual destruction of Chinas export
trade has not had much to do with bring-
ing the ancient empire to the point where
it seems about to be broken up? The
outflow from the old empire is not suffi-
cient to stem the inflow, and the aggres-
sive commerce of the outside world ap-
pears to be ready to break down the
ancient barriers and overflow the coun-
try, whether it will or no.
	This unification of tIme world, and its
reduction in size from the point of view
of commerce, reveal some tendencies
that are full of interest. The general
tendency to protection was the first an-
swer of the statesman and of the nations
to the pressure of competition from new
quarters. It represented an effort to
make the terms of the world competition
between young countries and old, be-
tween old countries and new, somewhat
more even. The remarkable exception
to this tendency presented by Great
Britain reflects the exceptional situation
of Great Britain among the nations.
Her home domain is too small to furnish
occupation either for her men or for her</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00164" SEQ="0164" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="158">	158	The Trend of the century.
money, and therefore the people of the
little island have swarmed all over the
world. As a consequence, Great Brit-
ain s commercial policy is, in a certain
sense, a world policy; but it is notice-
able that the other great nations, whether
young or old, being obliged to frame
their policy from a different point of
view, have hitherto relied, with few if
any exceptions, upon protection to equal-
ize the terms of the competition. Now,
however, a second tendency appears to be
discernible. If protection represents the
attempt of a nation to hold itself aloof,
to some extent, from the competition of
the world, the tendency of the aggres-
sive nations of Europe to divide up
among themselves the undeveloped por-
tions of the earth, and even the territory
of weaker nations, seems to me to re-
present a growing conviction that the
policy of protection, from its nature,
must be a temporary one; and also to
reveal a dimly recognized belief that the
true way for the old countries to contend
with the semi-civilized, in the long run,
is to raise the standard of living in the
less advanced countries, so that the semi-
civilized shall not be able to drag the
most highly developed peoples down to
their own level. That is to say, if the
first response of the civilized nations to
the world competition to which I have
referred has been the attempt to limit
its unwelcome effects by the erection of
artificial barriers at every custom house,
the second response seems likely to come
in the effort of the strong nations to dom-
inate the weak,  not for their destruc-
tion, but for their uplifting. In other
words, civilization, being brought face to
face with the competition of the semi-
civilized, appears to believe that the best
way to preserve its own integrity is to
introduce the conditions of civilization
everywhere. If this be a correct diag-
nosis of the recent developments of f or-
eign policy on the part of several of the
great nations, it indicates a disposition
to secure protection in the future by ag
gressive action, rather than by defensive
action as heretofore. I am not discuss-
ing the merits of the case, but only try-
ing to point out the possible significance
of movements that are likely to have no
little influence on the future.
	But we should lose sight of one of the
most important factors that have been at
work in producing these results and in
changing the life of men, if we did not
consider for a moment the influence of
invention in the great domain of industry.
In its relation to agriculture this influence
appears in three forms: there has been
a much more intelligent application of
chemistry to the cultivation of the soil;
steam power has been very largely sub-
stituted for hand power; and the rail-
road has made accessible vast areas of
country which, in any previous age of
the world, it would have been impossi-
ble profitably to cultivate. In the sub-
stitution of machinery for hand power
in the domain of manufacture, two inci-
dental results have proved of far-reach-
ing consequence, although neither was
necessarily involved in the substitution
of the machine for the hand. I refer,
first to the division of labor, and sec-
ond to the interchangeability of parts
in many standard manufactured arti-
cles. It has added enormously to the
productiveness of a factory to divide
the labor employed according to the
processes. By this means, the labor
becomes more expert, the product is in-
creased, and the quality is improved. It
is true that the action of the laborer
thereby becomes also, to a great extent,
automatic; but so does the execution of
the skilled musician, as the result of his
practice and his skill. It is probable that
the mind of the laborer, thus largely set
free during his hours of toil, is at work
quite as busily as before, and in ways
that make him more than ever an active
factor in the worlds life. The practice
of making interchangeable parts in many
manufactured articles has also added
enormously to the convenience and avail-</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00165" SEQ="0165" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="159">	The Trend of the Cent cary.	159

ability of such articles. The standardiz-
ing of the threads of screws, the sizes of
bolts, and the like adds beyond measure
to the effectiveness of manufacture and
to the convenience of industry. But it
is a superficial view of these things to
suppose that their effect is exhausted in
a tendency to cheapen products and to
improve industrial opportunity. It is
evident that division of labor is possi-
ble under freedom only in a community
the members of which are animated by
mutual trustfulness and mutual respect.
Interchangeable parts are of value only
when men trade continually with one an~
other. They involve a recognition of
the advantage to be had by considering
the general welfare rather than simply
one s own convenience. That is to say,
both of these things reveal and emphasize
the tendency to democracy in industry,
which seems to me as marked a feature
of our times as the tendency to demo-
cracy in the political life of men. In
other words, industry rests more and
more completely upon the mutual inter-
dependence of the masses of mankind.
	Other changes, less material, have
taken place in the commercial and in-
dustrial world during this same great
century. The wage system has become
universal, and the corporation and the
trade union have become dominant in
many branches of industry and com-
merce. Commodore Vanderbilt laid the
foundation of his fortune by operating a
small boat on a ferry. The business of
transportation grew under his hands to
such an extent that even so exception-
ally able a man as he could not control
it in his own person. Under the form of
a corporation, he was obliged to associate
with himself many others, in order to
carry on the immense business which he
developed. The corporation, in this as-
pect, therefore, is democratic, resting as
it does upon the substitution of the own-
ership of many for the ownership of one.
A sailing-ship used to cost comparatively
little, and many an individual could af
ford to have one or two or a small fleet
of them. The modern steamship, on the
other hand, is exceedingly costly, and
there would be few of them indeed if
there were no more than could be owned
by individuals. But just as in political
democracy there is a tendency on the part
of the many blindly to follow one, so in
corporations one man is apt to determine
the efficiency or inefficiency of the cor-
poration. Similarly, in the trade union
and other organizations of labor, the or-
ganizations which are the most capably
led are the most effective.
	The corporation and the trade union
interest me especially from another point
of view, because of the strange contrast
they present to the democratic tenden-
cies of the times. Democracy, as a po-
litical theory, emphasizes the equality of
men. and the equal rights and privileges
of all men before the law. The tenden-
cy of it has been, in this country, to de-
velop in multitudes of men great indi-
viduality and self-reliance. Side by side
with this tendency, however, we see the
corporation supplanting the individual
capitalist, and the, trade union obliter-
ating the individual laborer, as direct
agents in the work of the world. Strange
as this contrast is, both tendencies must
be consistent with democracy, for the
corporation and the trade union flourish
most where democracy is most developed.
Indeed, they seem to be successful and
powerful just because democracy pours
into them both its vital strength. The
criticisms that are justly enough launched
against both probably spring largely from
the fact that, by reason of the rapidity
of their development, men have not yet
learned how to control them so as to se-
cure the maximum of benefit and the
minimum of abuse.
	In this country, I suppose, there are
few who would deny that the corporate
form of doing business is not only in-
evitable, but on the whole advantageous.
At the same time, the opinion undoubt-
edly would be almost as universal that</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00166" SEQ="0166" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="160">	160	The Trend of the Century.
the abuses in corporate management con-
front the country with some of the most
serious problems that lie before it. The
impersonality of the corporation lends it-
self readily to many abuses from which
the sense of personal responsibility saves
individual men. The corporation, being
a creature of legislation, as it has gradu-
ally acquired control of more and more
of the field of business, has brought all
business into relations with the legisla-
ture which are as unfortunate as possible.
When business was in private control,
legislators interfered comparatively little,
because those who conducted the business
had votes. Corporations, however, have
no votes; but they have money; and it
is not exaggeration to say that the peo-
ple fear, if they do not believe, that the
money of the corporations is often more
influential in shaping legislation than are
the votes of the people. The statement
of a railroad magnate, that in Republi-
can counties he was a Republican, and
in Democratic counties he was a Demo-
crat, but that everywhere he was for
the railroad, was the cynical admission
of an attitude easily understood, but
none the less dangerous. When one
tries to devise remedies for the evident
dangers of the situation, it is not easy to
be precise. It is possible, I think, to
indicate some directions in which to look
for improvement, so far as improvement
is possible outside of higher standards
of public virtue. The fundamental evil
in the corporate form of management,
undoubtedly, is the loss of personal re-
sponsibility. It is a common remark
that as directors men will do things
which as individuals they would not
think of doing. Indeed, the evil lies
deeper than this. Because they are di-
rectors, and therefore, as they say, trus-
tees for others, they feel constrained to
do for the benefit of the stockholders
what as individuals they abhor. This
reasoning may well be considered falla-
cious, but that it is very influential in
determining the action of corporate di-
rectors cannot be questioned. The re-
medy for this loss of personal responsi-
bility, so far as there is any remedy by
legislation, must come from publicity.
When the legislature grants the imper-
sonal form for the conduct of business,
and grants, in addition, a limited liabil-
ity, there is no reason why it should not,
at the same time, demand that all of the
operations of this artificial person  or
perhaps I ought to say, of this combina-
tion of natural and privileged persons 
should be matters of public record. The-
oretically, I cannot believe that there is
any reason why the demand for publicity
in relation to the actions of corporations
should not be carried to any detail to
which it may be necessary to carry it in
order to secure the result of absolute hon-
esty as toward stockholders, creditors,
and the public. It should be observed,
perhaps, that corporations naturally di-
vide themselves into two classes,  those
which exercise, by virtue of a public
franchise, quasi-governmental functions,
and those which conduct purely private
business. I think the same rule of pub-
licity, as a general principle, should ap-
ply to both kinds of corporations; but it
is evident that publicity may have to be
carried much further in regard to the
first kind than in regard to the second.
	I think there is one other direction in
which corporations can be further con-
trolled to the public advantage. In many
of the states, already, it is impossible to
organize a corporation without paying in
the capital in cash. If this requirement
could be extended so as to demand that
neither stock nor bonds should be issued
except for a cash equivalent, it would
strike at the root of one of the evils in-
cident to corporate management which
has done much to arouse against corpo-
rations popular indignation. I do not
know why the law might not require,
where stock or bonds are to be issued as
the equivalent of invested property, pat-
ents, good - will, and the like, that the
valuation upon which such issues may be</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00167" SEQ="0167" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="161">	The Trend of the Century.	161

made should be fixed by public authori-
ty. The corporation that means to serve
the public honestly and fairly is not like-
ly to object to being required to have
assets of full value for all the securities
which it offers to the public. It is the
corporation which wishes to make money
out of the public dishonestly that aims
to float all manner of securities that have
no value at all, or only a nominal value.
I believe it to be a righteous demand that
the laws regulating corporations should
protect the public much more adequately
than they do now against such frauds.
	But while it is evident that the cor-
porate form of conducting business has
been of wide benefit to mankind, despite
the abuses that have attached to it, there
may not be such general admission of
the truth that the trade union and the
labor organization have been equally
beneficial. It is sometimes said that
labor organizes because capital does, and
that it is obliged to do so in self-defense.
I am far from saying that there is no
truth in this statement, but I think that
it is only a partial statement of the truth.
Labor organizes, primarily, not simply to
contend against capital and for self-de-
fense, but for precisely the same reason
that capital does; that is, for its own ad-
vantage. It organizes in response to a
tendency of the times which labor can
resist no more than capital. It is the re-
cognition by labor of the vision of the
poet, that the individual withers and the
world is more and more. It may not
be denied that organized labor has often
been cruel in its attitude to laboring men
who wish to work upon an individual
basis; but it cannot be justly said that it
is more cruel than organized capital has
been in its own field. The individual
competitor has been removed from the
pathway of the trust as remorselessly as
the individual laborer has been deprived
of work by the labor organization. In-
deed, I think it may be said that there
is no fault that can be charged against or-
ganized labor which may not be charged
	VOL. LXXXII.  NO. 490.	11
with equal truth against organized capi-
tal. The forms in which these faults
exhibit themselves, from the nature of
the case, are different, but in both in-
stances the fault is the same. In the
meanwhile, one has only to consider the
protectionist policy of nations in order
to be able to understand the protection-
ist policy of the trade unions. No labor-
ing man can tell at what moment a new
invention will appear which will deprive
him of his livelihood. It is inevitable,
at such a time, that men should draw
together and present a common front to
the problems of life, rather than attempt
to contend with them as individual atoms.
It is evident, also, that in many direc-
tions the trade union has improved the
condition of the laboring man, looked at
from the point of view of the mass. It
seems to me that the true line of devel-
opment, instead of antagonizing labor
organization, is to endeavor to make it
responsible, so as to substitute for the
irresponsibility of the single laborer the
adequate responsibility of the great body
of laborers. I have been told that in the
most progressive labor unions of Eng-
land, where the question is an older one
than it is here, the aim of the union is to
determine by joint action and by agree-
ment with the employers the conditions
under which the trade shall be carried
on, and the tendency is to be indifferent
whether the person employed is in the
union or out of the union, provided that
the standard regulations thus established
for the trade are observed upon both
sides. Under such a policy the war of
the union is waged against inequitable
conditions of life, and not against indi-
vidual laborers who happen to be outside
of the union. It is easy to understand
that the employer would prefer to have
all such matters entirely under his own
control, but it is probably true that, un-
der the complex conditions of modern
life, this is no longer absolutely possible
anywhere; and it is also probably true
that, by a general recognition of this cir</PB>

cumstance, the standard of living may
be raised in any community, to the great
benefit of all concerned.
	The tendency to democracy in politics
is unquestionably the dominant political
fact of the century. Not to attempt
to trace the operation of this tendency
everywhere, it seems to show itself not
only in the wide extension of the suf-
frage in such countries as England and
the United States, but also in the nation-
wide army of Germany. It is true that
there is little enough of the free spirit of
democracy in a military system like that
of Germany. On the other hand, the uni-
versal suffrage existing in Germany for
the election of members of the Reichstag,
and the universal demand of the state
for military service from all its people,
are both of them instances of the use of
the democratic spirit of the times in the
service of a different polity. In other
words, outside of Russia, and possibly
even there, monarchical government in
Europe is obliged to depend for its sup-
port upon the great body of the nation,
instead of upon the power of the great
and the noble. In England, the mon-
archy, although it retains the forms and
expressions of power that were natural
in the time of the Tudors, has become
so responsive to the demands of demo-
cracy as to give, in effect, a democratic
government. In the United States, the
century. though it began with a lim-
ited suffrage, ends with universal man-
hood suffrage, and even with woman
suffrage in some of the Western States.
There is one essential difference, how-
ever, which ought never to be forgotten,
between the democracy of the United
States and the democracy of England.
The struggle of democracy in England
for centuries has been to convert a gov-
ernment of privilege into a modern de-
mocracy. This implies an hereditary
disposition on the part of the great body
of the people to look up to men of edu-
cation and position as natural leaders, 
a tendency which still remains to temper
very importantly all the activities of
English public life. In the United States
there is no such tendency. Hence the
problem of democracy here is to learn
how to educate itself to higher stan-
dards, and therefore to the attainment
of better results. In other words, de-
mocracy in the United States is building
on hard-pan, and every advance gained
is an advance that reveals the education
of the whole people to a higher level.
Undoubtedly, universal suffrage and the
large immigration of people without any
experience in self-government have given
form to many of our problems; but I
often think there is far too great a dispo-
sition among us to magnify the difficul-
ties which these conditions present. If
all our failures be admitted, whatever
they are, the history of the United States
is certainly a marvelous one. Surely, it
is bad philosophy to assume that our his-
tory is what it is in despite of, and not
because of, our democracy. It is a nota-
ble fact that hardly an immigrant who
remains in this country long enough to
become a citizen is willing to return to
live in his own home. This is a striking
testimony to the fact that, whatever our
shortcomings, the average conditions of
life are freer and happier here than any-
where else in the world. And our insti-
tutions have certainly sufficed to produce
a people of the very highest average of
intelligence.
	The fact is, in my judgment, that our
problems arise not so much from uni-
versal suffrage as from the effect of the
multiplication table applied to all the
problems of life. I recollect that Mr.
James Bryce, when in this country a few
years ago, delivered an interesting lec-
ture which he entitled An Age of Discon-
tent. In the lecture he pointed out that
during the early part of this century the
great desire of men was for political lib-
erty. But when political liberty had been
obtained, he said, instead of ushering in
an epoch of universal good will, it had
brought with it apparently only universal</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00169" SEQ="0169" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="163">	The Trend of the Century.	163

discontent. Allowing the statement to
pass unchallenged, if I were to try to
suggest an explanation of this discontent,
I should be inclined to say, first of all,
that a partial explanation, at least, can
be found iu the immense increase of pop-
ular opportunity that is due to the spread
of democracy, and which has resulted in
so magnifying every problem that the
world has not yet learned how to deal
with many of them. The problems are
not only new; in scale they are thorough-
ly in keeping with the times, for nothing
is more characteristic of the age than the
large units of its enterprise. A single
building to-day will hold as many tenants
as a block of buildings in the beginning
of the century; a single bridge of our
time will cost as much as twenty bridges
of the earlier day; and so one might go
through the entire catalogue of private
and public undertakings. But size often
makes simple things difficult. Any one
building a house in the country, when he
has dug a well has solved the problem of
his water supply; but to supply water
for a great city calls for the outlay of
millions of dollars, and for the employ-
ment of the best engineering talent in the
land. Yet nothing has happened except
that the problem has been magnified.
Thus the difficulties created by the multi-
plication table are real; so that the very
enlargement of opportunity that demo-
cracy has brought with it has faced de-
mocracy with problems far harder than
were formerly presented to any govern-
ment.
	Another cause of the prevailing dis-
content, if that be taken for granted,
I find in the constant and uprooting
changes in life that have been incident
to the rapid progress of scientific inven-
tion in our day, and from which no class
of people have been exempt. The un-
rest is so general and so world-wide that
it is not surprising that men are seeking
to find for it some remedy which, by its
thoroughness, seems to give promise of
a complete cure. Every one is conscious
of the new problems, but no one is wise
enough to see how they are to be worked
out. Men want a universal panacea.
Accordingly, the anarchist and the nihil-
ist say that all government, or even so-
ciety itself, is a failure; that the thing
to do is to destroy the foundations of
government or of society as they now
exist, and to start fresh. The commu-
nist, less radical, says that society is not
at fault, but that the institution of pri-
vate property is the source of all trouble.
If communism could be introduced, and
the people could own everything in com-
mon, then, he thinks, the inequalities
and injustices of life would disappear.
The socialist, on the other hand, recog-
nizing the fallacy of both claims, says,
No, that is not the trouble. The state,
as the one preeminently democratic cor-
poration of the day, ought to control the
instruments of industry and commerce.
When these are controlled by the state,
for the general good, instead of being
held as now for private advantage, then
a better day will be ushered in. And
so it goes. It cannot be gainsaid that
under every form of government the
times are trying mens souls in every
condition of life; but there is no uni-
versal panacea. There is nothing to be
done but patiently to meet each problem
in the best way possible, in the confi-
dence that in the long run the outcome
will be advantageous to mankind. This,
at all events, I think may be said of our
own people, and of their equipment for
the problems of the times: that the
American people, in great crises, by their
self-control, by their willingness to make
sacrifices, and by their evident honesty
of purpose, have gladdened the hearts of
their friends, and have encouraged those
who love to believe that mankind is wor-
thy of trust. That our country has not
perfectly learned the art of self-govern-
ment goes without saying; but that it has
made progress in many and difficult di-
rections I think must also be admitted.
	In the meanwhile, some of the pro-</PB>

blems of greatest difficulty are those
which come simply from our size. Mere-
ly to get out the vote of a great city, or of
a state, or of the nation requires so much
machinery as to give to the machine in
politics a power that does not always
make for the public good. It is not sur-
prising, therefore, that wherever this pro-
blem is greatest, as in the large cities
and the large states, there the tendency
to the control of the machine by one man,
and to the control of the government by
one man through his control of the ma-
chine, is the most evident. It does not
yet fully appear how the country is to se-
cure the legitimate results now obtained
through the party machines, without pay-
ing to the machines, as such, a price
which is out of all proportion to the
value of their services. It is not to be
believed, however, for one moment, that
the wisdom and patriotism of the future
will be any less equal to the solution of
problems than the wisdom and patriot-
ism of the past have been. It is appar-
ent that the power of the machine, in the
last statement, lies in its control of the
power to nominate, because the control
of that power opens or closes for every
man the door to public life. In some
way, it must be made easier for men
whose aim is simply to serve the public
to get into public life and to stay in it
without loss of self-respect. The many
movements toward primary reform which
look to regaining for the people the con-
trol of nominations are movements in the
right direction. It is evident that the
public instinct has recognized the source
of the difficulty, and that everywhere
men are at work trying to find a remedy
for the evils of which they have become
aware. The saying, Eternal vigilance
is the price of liberty, did not originate
in our day. We are conscious of our own
shortcomings and of our own difficulties,
and we are apt to forget those out of which
the world has grown. We have only to
remember these things to gain heart. In
a single word, I believe the problem of
good government, in our day and coun-
try, is largely a problem of education;
and in this view it is interesting to recall
what was pointed out not long ago by
Dr. Stanley Hall, that education is the
one thing as to . the value of which all
men everywhere, at the present time, are
agreed. Not that there is agreement on
the methods and detail of education, but
all men are agreed that education is a
thing to be encouraged, a thing to be de-
sired, a thing to be struggled for, and a
thing to profit by. In this education our
universities have a large part to play.
They are already doing much in the di-
rection of a constructive study of poli-
tics and of society. Perhaps they are
not doing enough in the direction of the
constructive study of industry and com-
merce, for in an industrial and commer-
cial age both political and social ques-
tions are largely shaped by commerce
and industry. In economics, the work
of the universities is largely critical, not
to say destructive; but because of their
ability to illuminate the problems of the
present with a broad knowledge of what
is being done the world over, as well as
with the knowledge of the past, and be-
cause of their own inherent democracy
of spirit which puts them in vital touch
with the spirit of the times, I am con-
fident that they may, if they will, make
valuable contributions to such a study of
industry andecommerce as will cause the
universities to become still more impor-
tant factors in shaping the future of the
country.
	To sum up, therefore, I should say
that the trend of the century has been to
a great increase in knowledge, which has
been found to be, as of old, the know-
ledge of good and evil; that this know-
ledge has become more and more the
property of all men rather than of a
few; that, as a result, the very increase
of opportunity has led to the magnifying
of the problems with which humanity is
obliged to deal; and that we find our-
selves, at the end of the century, face to</PB>

THE PROPER BASIS OF ENGLISH CULTURE.

	SURELY it is time our popular cul-
ture were cited into the presence of the
Fathers. That we have forgotten their
works is in itself matter of mere impiety
which many practical persons would con-
sider themselves entitled to dismiss as a
purely sentimental crime; but ignorance
of their ways goes to the very root of

ful as to merit some preliminary setting

of fact, our genuine affection for these
beautiful foreign works is here adduced
because, in establishing our love for great
poetry in general, it necessarily also es-
tablishes some special cause for our neg-
lect of native works in particular.
	For example, we are all ready to smile
with a lofty good humor when we find
Puttenham, in 1589, devoting a grave
chapter to prove that there rsiay be an
Arte of our English Poesie as well as
there is of the Latine and Greeke; we
remember the crushing domination of the
old culture in his time, and before it
we wonder complacently at all that icy
business of elegant Latin verses and
polite literature, and we feel quite
comfortable in thinking how completely
we have changed these matters.
	Have we? One will go into few mod-
erately appointed houses in this country
without finding a Homer in some form
or other; but it is probably far within
the truth to say that there are not fifty
copies of Beo~vulf in the United States.1
Or, again, every boy, though far less
learned than that erudite young person
of Macaulays, can give some account
of the death of Hector; but how many
boys  or, not to mince matters, how
many men  in America could do more
than stare if asked to relate the death
of Byrhtnoth? Yet Byrhtnoth was a
hero of our own England in the tenth
century, whose manful fall is recorded
in English words that ring on the soul
like arrows on armor. Why do we not
draw in this poem  and its like  with
our mothers milk? Why have we no
nursery songs of Beowulf and the Gren-
del? Why does not the serious educa-
tion of every English-speaking boy com-
mence, as a matter of course, with the
Anglo-Saxon grammar? These are more
serious questions than any one will be
prepared to believe who has not followed
them out to their logical results.
For the absence of this primal Angli-

editions of the work have been published here.
cism from our modern system goes, as
was said, to the very root of culture.
The eternal and immeasurable signifi-
cance of that individuality in thought
which flows into idiom in speech be-
comes notably less recognized among us.
We do not bring with us out of our
childhood the fibre of idiomatic English
which our fathers bequeathed to us. A
boys English is diluted before it has be-
come strong enough for him to make up
his mind clearly as to the true taste of it.
Our literature needs Anglo-Saxon iron;
there is no ruddiness in its cheeks, and
everywhere a clear lack of the red cor-
puscles. Current English prose, on both
sides of the water, reveals an ideal of
prose-writing most like the leaden sky
of a November day, that overspreads the
earth with dreariness,  no rift in its
tissue nor fleck in its tint. Upon any
soul with the least feeling for color the
model editorial of the day leaves a
profound dejection. The sentences are
all of a height, like regulars on parade;
and the words are immaculately prim,
smug, and clean-shaven. Out of all this
regularity comes a kind of prudery in
our literature. It ought not to be, that
our sensibilities are shocked with strong
individualities of style like Carlyles or
even Ruskins. One always finds a cer-
tain curious reaction of this sensibility
upon these men, manful as they are;
they grow nervous with the fine sense
of a suspicion of charlatanry in using a
ruddy-cheeked style when the general
world writes sallow-skinned; and hence
sometimes too much color in their style,
 a blush, as it were. We are guilty of
a gross wrong in our behavior toward
these authors and their like. A man
should have his swing in his writing.
That is the main value of it; not to
sweep me off my legs with eloquent pro-
pagandism, but simply to put me in po-
sition where I may place the frank and
honest-spoken view of another man along-
side my own, and so make myself as
large as two men, quoad rem.</PB>

	But we lack a primal idiomatic bone
and substance; we have not the stalwart
Anglicism of style which can tolerate
departures, breaks, and innovations; we
are as uncomfortable over our robustious
Carlyle as an invalid, all nerves, with a
great rollicking boy in the room,  we
do not know what he may do next.
	How wonderful this seems, if we take
time to think what a strong, bright, pic-
ture-making tongue we had in the begin-
ning of the sixteenth century, when the
powerful old Anglo - Saxon had fairly
conquered all the foreign elements into
its own idiom I For it is about with
the beginning of that century that we
may say we had a fully developed Eng-
lish literary instrument. Chaucer was
not, and could not be, the well of Eng-
lish undefiled which Spensers somewhat
forgetful antiquarianism would have him.
He was fed with two streams of language
which were still essentially distinct in
many particulars. It was a long while
before the primal English conquered the
alien elements into its own idioms, 
longer, indeed, in Chaucers world than
in Langlands.
Almost every house will furnish the
means of placing in sharp contrast the
vivacity and robust manfulness of the
English language early in the sixteenth
century, and the more flaccid tongue
which had begun to exist even as early
as the eighteenth. Wartons History of
English Poetry, for example, collates a
couple of stanzas from The Nut-Brown
Maid  which must belong to the end of
the fifteenth or the beginning of the six-
teenth century  with the corresponding
stanzas of a paraphrase made by Prior
in 1718. It may not be amiss to make
sure by inserting one of these examples
here. In the original ballad, the wild
lover, testing the girls affection, cries 
Yet take good hede, for ever I drede
That ye could nat sustayne
The thornie wayes, the depe valeis,
The snowe, the frost, the rayne,
The colde, the hete; for, dry or wete,
We must lodge on the playne;
And us abofe none other rofe
But a brake bush or twayne;
Which sone sholde greve you, I believe,
And ye wolde gladly than
That I had to the grene wode go
Alone, a banyshed man.

	I cannot see how language could well
have put it feather than that; but, two
hundred years afterward, this is Priors
idea of the way it should have been said:
Those limbs, in lawn and softest silk arrayd,
From sunbeams guarded and of winds afraid,
Can they bear angry Jove? Can they resist
The parching dog-star and the bleak north-
east?
When, chilld by adverse snows and beating
rain,
We tread with weary steps the longsome plain;
When with hard toil we seek our evening food,
Berries and acorns from the neighbouring
wood;
And find among the cliffs no other house
But the thin covert of some gatherd boughs;

Wilt thou not then reluctant send thine eye
Around the dreary waste, and, weeping, try
(Though then, alas! that trial be too late)
To find thy fathers hospitable gate,
And seats where ease and plenty brooding
sate?
Those seats, whence long excluded thou must
mourn;
That gate, for ever barrd to thy return;
Wilt thou not then bewail ill-fated lov~,
And hate a banishd man, condemnd in
woods to rove?
	Or, if it be objected that this may
be an exaggerated single example which
proves little, almost every bookcase con-
tains Thomas Johness translation of
Froissart, in the notes to which occur
here and there extracts of parallel pas-
sages from Lord Bernerss translation,
made in the time of Henry YIII.; and
the least comparison of Berners with
Johnes shows how immeasurably more
bright, many-colored, and powerful is
the speech of the former.
	And this brightness, color, and power
make for the doctrine of this present
writing, because they are simply exu-
berant manifestations of pure Anglicism
put forth in the moment of its triumph.
We are all prone to forget the odds
against which this triumph was achieved.

For four hundred years  that is, in
round numbers, from 670 to 1070  the
English language was desperately striv-
ing to get into literature, against the
sacred wishes of Latin; and now, when
the Normans come, the tongue of Aid-
helm and C~edmon, of Alfred and 1-
fric and Cynewulf, must begin and fight
again for another four hundred years
against French,  fight, too, in such
depths of disadvantage as may be ga-
thered from many a story of the relentless
Norman efforts to exterminate the native
tongue. Witness, for example, Matthew
Pariss account of the deposition of the
Bishop of Worcester in 1095 by the
Normans because he was a superannu-
ated English idiot who could not speak
French; or Ralph Higdens complaint,
as John Trevisa translates it from the
Polychronicon: Children in scole,
ayenst the usage and manir of all other
nations, beeth compelled for to leve hire
owne langage and for to construe hire
lessons and hire thinges in French; and
so they haveth sethe Normans came first
into Engelond; moreover, Gentilmen
children beeth taught to speke Frensche
from ~the tyme that they bith rokked in
hire cradle and kumeth speke and play
with a childs broche.
	Eight hundred years the tough old
tongue has been grimly wrestling and
writhing, life and death on the issue,
now under this enemy, now under that,
when Lord Berners and Sir Thomas
More begin to speak.
	It is, therefore, with all the sacred
sanction of this long conflict that a man
can drive home upon our time these fol-
lowing charges: first, that it is doing its
best, in most of its purely literary work,
to convert the large, manful, and simple
idioms of Alfred and Cynewulf into the
small, finical, and knowing clevernesses
of a smart half-culture, which knows
	1 As distinguished from the modern scien-
tific English, which is certainly an admirable
instrument in the hands of Tyndall, of Huxley,
and of many more.
neither whence it came nor whither it is
going; and secondly, that as a people
we are utterly ignorant of even the names
of the products of English genius dur-
ing the first four hundred of the eight
hundred years just mentioned, insomuch
that if a fervent English-lover desire to
open his heart to some one about Beo-
wulf, or The Battle of Maldon, or The
Wanderer, or Deors Lament, or The
Pha~nix, or The Sea-farer, or The Ad-
dress of the Departed Soul to its Body,
or Elene, or the like, he must do it by
letter, for there are scarcely anywhere
two in a town who have read, or can
read, these poems.
	In short, our literary language1 has
suffered a dilution much like that which
music has undergone at the hands of the
weaker devotees since the free use of
the semitone began. Soon after the
chromatic tone had attained its place a
wonderful flexibility shows itself in mu-
sic, the art expands in many directions,
the province of harmony becomes inde-
finitely large; but this very freedom
proves the ruin of the weaker brethren:
the facilities of modulation afforded by
the minor chords and the diminished
sevenths tempt into unnieaning and cloy-
ing impertinences of composition, and
these have to be relieved, again, by set-
ting over-harsh and crabbed chords in
the midst of a too gracious flow of tone.
	Now, as music has reached a point
where it must pause, and reestablish the
dominancy of the whole tone, fortifying
it with whatever new tones may be found
possible in developing the scale accord-
ing to primal  or what we may call
musically idiomatic  principles, so must
our tongue recur to the robust forms,
and from these to the underlying and
determining genius, of its Anglo-Saxon2
period.
	In other words,  for what has so far

ally agreed to substitute Old English. I

been said has been in defense and expli-
cation of the sentence which stands at
the beginning of this paper,  culture
must be cited into the presence of the
Fathers.
	In the humblest hope of contributing
to that end, I eagerly embrace the op-
portunity of calling the general readers
attention to the rhythmical movement
 and afterward to the spiritual move-
ment  of an Anglo-Saxon poem dating
from about A. D. 993, known as The
Death of Byrhtnoth, or otherwise as The
Battle of Maldon, which, in the judg-
ment of my ear, sets the grace of loyalty
and the grimness of battle to noble mu-
sic. I think no man could hear this
poem read aloud without feeling his
heart beat faster and his blood stir.
	The rhythm of this poem  let it be
observed as the reader goes through the
scheme  is strikingly varied in time-
distribution from bar to bar. The poem,
in fact, counts with perfect confidence
upon the sense of rhythm, which is well-
nigh universal in our race, often boldly
opposing a single syllable in one bar to
three or four in the next. I should not
call this bold except for the timidity
of English poetry during the last two
hundred years, when it has scarcely ever
dared to venture out of the round of its
strictly defined iambics, forgetting how
freely our folk songs and nursery rhymes
employ rhythms and rhythmic breaks,
 as Peas porridge hot, for example,
or almost any verse out of Mother Goose,
 which, though complex from the
standpoint of our customary rhythmic
limitations, are instantly seized and co-
ordinated by children and child-minded
nurses.1

	[Apart from its literary merit, this
poem has other features of interest. It
is an example, perhaps singular, of an
epic contemporary with the events it re-

cites, and probably written by one who
had a share in the battle. The poets
point of view never moves from the Eng-
lish side; he does not know what is done
or said among the Danes; he knows none
of their names, not even that of their
leader. We may therefore rely on its be-
ing a faithful picture of what was done,
said, and even thought during this last
resolute stand of England against the vi-
kings.
	The incident itself is memorable. In
A. D. 979 IEthelred Lack-Counsel (gener-
ally called the Unready ) was crowned
at Kingston, and the bloody cloud in
the likeness of fire, seen at midnight,
which followed that event, may well have
seemed to the old chronicler, in the light
of later experience, a foretokening of the
years to come, when the heavens, night
after night, were red with the glare of
burning towns and homesteads, and the
ground was crimson with the blood of
the slaughtered English. For the Danes
had begun their terrible invasions, and
met with but little resistance. In the
next year, Leicester, Thanet, and South~
ampton were plundered, and the inhab-
itants mostly slain, says the chronicle;
in the next, Padstow in Cornwall was
plundered, and Devonshire harried with
fire and sword; in the next, London was
burnt. We come at last to the year 991,
and we are told 
In this year came Anlaf with ninety-
three ships to Staines and harried all
roundabout that; and then fared thence
to Sandwich, and thence on to Ipswich,
and overran all that, and so to Maldon
[Essex]. And there against them came
the ealdorman Byrhtnoth with his army,
and fought with them, and they slew the
ealdorman and held the battlefield. And
in this year for the first time men coun-
selled that they should rather pay tribute
to the Danish men for the mickle terror
that they wrought at the sea-coasts. And

	It is plain from this that the fall of
Byrhtnoth snapped the sinews of Eng-
lish resistance; and from this time forth
we read of nothing but feeble and futile
musterings of men, without plan or con-
cert of action, and all to no purpose:
half-battles lost because the support did
not arrive in time; fleets ordered to
help the land force, and coming after all
was over; and ever, says the chroni-
cler, when they should have been for-
warder, then were they later, am ever
the foes waxed more and more. And
the tribute grew heavier and heavier,
and there was less to pay it with, and
leaders like ~lfric turned traitors in
sheer despair, until the doomed king,
crowning a life of imbecility by a deed
of bloody madness, slaughtered the peace-
ful colonists of the Danelagh, and Swe-
gen came in a storm of fire and blood,
hurling the wretched descendant of Cer-
dic from the throne, while England bent
her neck to the Danish rule. After half
a century, two phantoms of a monk and
a warrior, Edward and Harold, seemed
to wear the Saxon crown; but the mon-
archy of Alfred received its death-blow
at Maldon, not because the East Saxon
militia was broken, but because Byrht-
noth fell.
	And now who was Byrhtnoth? The
chronicler, overmuch given to record-
ing investitures and deaths of bishops
and abbots, tells us but little; but from
the Book of Ely, an abbey founded by
Byrhtnoth himself, we get glimpses of
him, probably from the hand of one who
had seen him face to face. He was eal-
dorman  that is, lord or general  of
the East Saxons, and one of the greatest
nobles in England. He was, says the
monkish historian, eloquent of speech,
great of stature, exceeding strong, most
skillful in war, and of courage that knew
no fear. He spent his whole life in de-
fending the liberty of his country, being
altogether absorbed in this one desire,
and preferring to die rather than to leave
one of its injuries unavenged. And all
the leaders of the shires put their trust
altogether in him.
	After telling of several of his victories,
the historian comes to his last fight. His
force was far inferior to that of the in-
vaders, but he hastened to meet them
without waiting for reinforcements,  a
piece of rashness like that recorded in
the poem, where, from mere excess of
haughty courage, he disdains to defend
the ford of Panta, and lets the vikings
cross unmolested, a fatal hardihood
which cost him the battle and his life.
On his march, when he came to Ram-
sey Abbey he asked for provisions for
his men. The abbot said that it was not
possible for him to feed so great a num-
ber, but, not to seem churlish, he would
receive as his guests the ealdorman and
seven others. Byrhtnoth rejected the
mean offer with scorn. I cannot fight
without them, he said, and I will not
eat without them, and so marched on to
Ely, where Abbot IElfsig bounteously
entertained him and his force.
	But the ealdorman, thinking that
he had been burdensome to the abbey,
would not leave it unrewarded; and on
the following morning bestowed upon it
six rich manors, and promised nine
more, with thirty marks of gold and
twenty pounds of silver, on the condi-
tion that if be fell in the battle his
body should be brought and buried
there. To this gift he also added two
crosses of gold and gems, and a pair of
curiously wrought gloves. And so, com-
mending himself to the prayers of the
brethren, he went forth to meet the
enemy.
	When he met them,~undeterred by
the multitude of foes and the fewness of
his own men, he attacked them at once,
and for fourteen days fought with them
daily. But on the last day, but few of
his men being left alive, and perceiving
that he was to die, he attacked them
with none the less courage, and had al-
most put them to flight, when the Danes,
taking heart from the small numbers of</PB>

the English, formed their force into a
wedge, and threw themselves upon them.
Byrhtnoth was slain, fighting valiantly,
and the enemy cut off his head, and hare
it with them to their own country!
	Plainly a prince of men, and the true
king of England at that day, though
he never wavered in his allegiance to
ZEthelred, my prince. And this last
day of the great dim battle in the
east, more worthy the poets song than
that merely fabulous battle in the
west which the late Laureate celebrated
in such singing verse,  this last agony
of the last vigorous struggle to free Eng-
land from the ferocious invaders, is the
subject of the poem.
	True, Byrhtnoth is not so musical
a name as Arthur, and Leofsunu and
Wulfmier sound harsh compared with
Lancelot and Percivale; but the fantas-
tic chivalry of the Round Table and
their phantom-like king are not only his-
torically untrue, but merely impossible,
 a bright-hued web of the stuff that
dreams are made of,  while these gal-
lant men of Essex and their heroic chief
veritably lived, and fought, and died
where they stood, rather than yield one
foot of English ground or forsake their
fallen leader; and they were men of our
own race, and it maybe that their blood
flows in our own veins.
	Unflinching courage, personal devo-
tion to the chief, absolute contempt of
death, are matters of course in this war-
rior-poets mind, and need no particular
eulogy.]

	I have translated two hundred lines
of the poem,  which is a fragment, of
three hundred and twenty-five lines in
all, lacking the original beginning and
end,  with special reference to two
matters.
	(1.) In the first hundred lines  be-
ing the first hundred of the poem as it
stands  I have had particularly in view
the send and drive of the rhythm: and
to keep these in the readers mind I
have made the translation, so far as the
end of that hundred, mostly in dactyls,
which continually urge the voice forward
to the next word, with an occasional
trochee for breath and variety.
	(2.) But in my second hundred lines
being those consecutively following the
first, up to the hundred and eighty-fifth
line of the poem, when I pass to the last
sixteen, with an intercalary account in
short of the matter of the imitervening
hundred and twenty-five  I have aban-
doned the metrical purpose, and changed
the paramount object to that of show-
ing the peculiar idioms of Anglo-Saxon
poetry: the order of words, the vigorous
use of noun and verb, the parallelisms
and repetitions (like those of Hebrew
poetry, as in the lines near the last,
]Elfnod and Wulfmier lay slain; by
the side of their prince they parted with
life), and the like. I have thought that
the modern reader might contemplate
with special profit the sparing use of those
particles  such as the, a or an,
his, their, and others  which have
made the modern tongue so different
from the old, both in its rhythmical work-
ing and in its weight or momentum.
The old tongue is notably sterner, and
often stronger, by its ability to say
	man, horse, shield, and not  the
man, a horse, his shield, etc.
and it is an interesting question, at least,
whether we might not with advantage
educate our modern sense to be less
shocked by the omission of these par-
ticles at need. Without here adducing
many ~onsiderations which would have
to be weighed before any one could make
up his judgment on this point, I have
simply called attention to these particles,
where modern usage required me to sup-
ply them in the translation, by inclosing
them in parentheses.
	In both the metrical and the unmetrical
portions of the translation I have dis-
carded the arrangement into lines as in-
terfering with the objects in view; the
poem showing clearly enough, by the</PB>

plane of its thought, that it is a poem,
though presented in whatever forms of
prose.
The fragment begins with the last
two words of some sentence, brocen
wurde (was broken), and then proceeds
as follows: 
Bade then (that is, Byrhtnoth bade)
each warrior loose him his horse and
drive it afar, and fare thus on to the
hand-fight, hopeful of heart.
	Then straightway the stripling of Offa
beheld that the earl would abide no
cowardly thing: so there from his hand
he let fly his falcon, his beloved hawk,
away through the wood, and strode to the
battle; and man might know that never
that youth would fail from the fight
when once he fell to his weapon. There-
at Eadric was minded to stand by his
ealdorman fast in the fight; forth gan
bear his javelin foe-ward, manful in
mood, whilever that he in his hands
might hold his buckler and broadsword;
his vaunt he avouched with his deeds,
that there he should fight in front of his
prince.
	Then Byrhtnoth began to array him
his warriors, rode and directed, coun-
selled the fighters how they should stand
and steadfastly hold to their places,
showed them how shields should be
gripped full hard with the hand, and
bade them to fear not at all. When fair-
ly his folk were formed he alighted in
midst of the liegemen that loved him
fondliest; these full well he wist that
his faithfullest hearth-fighters weie.
	Then stood forth one from the vi-
kings, strongly called, uttered his words,
shouted the sea-rogues threat to the earl
where he stood on the adverse shore:
Me have the scathful seamen sent,
and bidden me say that now must thou
render rings 1 for thy ransom, and bet-
ter for you shall it be that ye buy off a
battle with tribute than trust the hard-

you, if only ye heed this message; firm
will we fashion a peace with the gold.
If thou that art richest wouldst ransom
thy people, pay, for a peace, what the
seamen shall deem to be due; we will
get us to ship with the gold, and fare
off over the flood, and hold you acquit.
	Byrhtnoth cried to him, brandished
the buckler, shook the slim ash, with
words made utterance, wrathful and re-
solute, gave him his answer: Hearest
thou, sea-rover, that which my folk say-
eth? Yes, we will render you tribute
	in javelins  poisonous point, and

ward you not in the fight. Herald of

thy people a bitterer message: that here

Too base, methinketh that ye with your

	Bade he then bear forward bucklers,
and warriors go, till they all stood ranged
on the bank that was east. Now there,
for the water, might never a foeman
come to the other: there came flowing
the flood after ebb-tide, mingled the
streams: too long it seemed to them,
ere that together the spears would come.

	There stood they in their strength by
Pantas stream, the East-Saxon force
and the ship-host: nor might either of
them harm the other, save wheu one fell
by an arrows flight.

hardened warrior hold him the bridge,
who Wulfstan was hight, bold with his
kinsmen, Ceolas son; he smote with his
spear the first man down that stepped
over-bold on the bridge. There stood
by Wulfstan warriors dauntless, Maccus
and IElfere, proud-souled twain; they
recked not of flight at the ford, but
stoutly strove with the foe what while
they could wield their weapons. When
they encountered and eagerly saw how
bitter the bridgewards were, then the
hostile guests betook them to cunning;
ordered to seize the ascents, and fare
through the ford and lead up the line.
Now the earl in his over-bold mood gave
over-much2 land to the foe. There,
while the warriors whist, fell Byrht-
helms bairn 8 to calling over the waters
cold : 
Now there is room for you, rush to
us, warriors to warfare; God wot, only,
which of us twain shall possess this place
of the slaughter!
	Waded the war - wolves west over
Panta, recked not of water, warrior vi-
kings. There, oer the wave they bore
up their bucklers, the seamen lifted their
shields to the land. In wait with his
warriors, Byrhtnoth stood; he bade form
the war-hedge of bucklers, and hold that
ward firm to the foe. The fight was at
hand, the glory of battle; the time was
come for the falling of men that were
doomed.
	There was a scream uphoven, ravens
hovered, (and) the eagle sharp for car-
nage; on earth was clamor.
They let from (their) hands (the) file-

the sea-warrior (a) Southern spear that

wrought then with his shield that the
shaft burst in pieces and that spear broke

the warrior; he with (his) spear stung

the blither; laughed the valorous man,
said thanks to the Creator for the days-
work that the Lord gave him.
	Then some (one) of the warriors let
fly from his hand a dart that it forth-

the Whiggism of Macaulay show that
each took a retainer on his side. For
such reasons, of the thousands of histo-
ries with which the world has heen flood-
ed, scarcely more than half a dozen can
fairly he said to he alive after the lapse of
a hundred years. When one has named
the works of Herodotus, of Xenophon,
of Thucydides, of Julius C~esar, of Tad-
tus, and of Gibbon, what other historical
hooks are there, more than a hundred
years old, that can he said at the present
day to have any real vitality?
	It is to he feared that the United
States has fared no better than other na-
tions. The fierce democracy of Bancroft
blinded him to the other side, and the
federalism of Hildreth gives to his work
a kindred quality of partiality and in-
completeness. However unconsciously,
both were great advocates rather than
great judges. Other historians have had
the same defects, and the popular im-
agination has been obliged to feed itself
upon representations more or less incom-
plete. Forty years or more ago, one of
the foremost of American scholars re-
marked, before a large audience of uni-
versity professors and students, that his-
tory must be rewritten from the American
point of view. Although there may have
been some reason for such a declaration,
there seems to have been no need to give
it special emphasis; for, whatever have
been the defects of American historians,
lack of patriotism has certainly not been
one of them. It may well he doubted
whether, in any one of the crucial peri-
ods of our history, the unsuccessful side
has ever been adequately presented.
	Nor have we been altogether fortu-
nate in our historical novels. The im-
portance of fiction as a means of por-
traying the spirit of a time is not likely
to be denied, either by those who con-
scientiously take an inventory of their
own historical knowledge, or by those
who stop to consider how it is that their
fellows acquire historical impressions.
Very many of us would have to admit
that, aside from the somewhat unpala-
table and perhaps nauseating intellectu-
al pemmican of the old historical text-
books, we have derived our knowledge
of European history chiefly from the
historical romances of Scott and the
other novelists and dramatists of this
century. After all, history is but the
way in which the thoughts, the impres-
sions, and the acts of men and women
have moved in procession toward some
more or less definite end; and it is hard-
ly too much to say that this procession
has seldom been so vividly represented
by the historians as by the great novel-
ists and dramatists. Of the craft and
the cunning by which Louis XI. made
France into a nation, have not the most
of us learned more from Quentin Dur-
ward than from all other sources put to-
gether? Has not Woodstock given us
a large share of what we know of the
spirit and the atmosphere of the great
Cromwellian struggle? Do we not real-
ly know more of the essential characteris-
tics of Scotch history than we do of the
history of New England, or New York,
or Virginia? Nobody is likely to deny
that The Antiquary and Rob Roy and
Kidnapped and A Window in Thrums
have done more to make us feel the at-
mosphere of Scotch life, and make us
know how the Scotch have lived and
moved and had their being during the
last two centuries, than all the histories
combined.
	The business of acquiring what passes
for knowledge is not altogether a ques-
tion of accuracy, although on the matter
of accuracy itself there is not a little to
be said. Every historical scholar, as
well as every lawyer, knows that one of
the most difficult things in the world is
to be certain about a fact. Our courts
are organized for the purpose of pro-
moting the quest of facts in case of dif-
ferences of interests and opinions. Did
not the great Burke say that the highest
function of government was to put twelve
good men into a jury-box? It is by no</PB>

means always certain that the historical
description is more accurate as a repre-
sentation of the moving forces of society
than the novel; but even when it is more
accurate, it often fails to make any deep
impression on the public, because nine
persons are having their opinions rapidly
formed from the novel, while only one is
slowly reaching his conclusions from the
study of history.
	It can hardly be claimed that we in
the United States have been very suc-
cessful in presenting historical truth in
this way. Not many of our novels have
left a lasting impression. Hawthornes
Scarlet Letter, it is true, by catching the
weird and relentless spirit of Puritanism,
and impressing it deeply and permanent-
ly upon the imaginations of all readers
of good English everywhere, has done
more to create a strong and correct un-
derstanding of the dominant spirit of
New England Puritanism than all the
histories of New England put together.
Perhaps it should be said that service
of a kindred nature was rendered by
the representative historical novels of
Cooper. But all the works of this au-
thor had grave defects. Though the pic-
ture was less accurate, it was scarcely
less impressive; and consequently, it
served its purpose, for right or wrong,
in essentially the same way. Americans,
as well as Europeans, who fed their ju-
venile imaginations upon the Leather-
stocking Tales formed impressions which
subsequent knowledge has found it dif-
ficult to erase. So strong was this im-
pression that of thousands of people on
both sides of the Atlantic it has mat-
tered little that every one who has come
into close contact with the Indian  in-
deed, every one who has even at a dis-
tance studied his characteristics with
care  knows that he is a rudimentary
human being; that, with hardly a trace
of real nobility of nature, he is inferior
to the white man, even in those lower
qualities in which he has generally been
thought to excel. It is of little conse
quence that he has easily been outdone
whenever he has come into collision with
the white man on even terms; that he
is outwitted by the frontiersman in the
mysteries of woodcraft, and indeed in
all those qualities of resourceful cunning
which have been supposed to be his pecu-
liar characteristic. It is curious to re-
flect how hard it has been to eradicate
the impressions of the Indian that were
stamped into the minds of all readers of
novels some two generations ago.
	Hawthorne and Cooper are the two
great delineators of the spirit of the
times and the localities of which they
wrote; but where, until recently, have
we been encouraged to look for another?
The name of Mrs. Stowe will undoubt-
edly suggest itself to many minds as an
adequate answer; but a little reflection
will probably convince any thinking read-
er that Uncle Toms Cabin is not an his-
torical novel in any true sense whatever.
That remarkable book was certainly an
important contribution to literature and
to history. It is no doubt entitled to the
unique distinction of having planted con-
trolling impulses in the hearts of millions
of people, and of having preached its ser-
mon with a power that to a vast number
of its readers was absolutely irresistible.
It may be admitted, moreover, that it is
not unfaithful in its delineation of what
it portrays; for it probably cannot be
successfully denied that every one of its
horrors could be matched by some actual
occurrence. But it still remains true
that as a representation of slavery in its
completeness, except as a political tract,
it has the fatal defect of presenting a
single phase of the subject as if it were
the whole. Even its unrivaled effec-
tiveness as a political pamphlet cannot
rescue it from a one - sidedness which
will forever prevent it from taking rank
as a great historical novel. Quentin
Durward, The Heart of Midlothian, and
Henry Esmond are entitled to high rank,
not so much because of their exceptional
power of plot and description as be-</PB>

cause of the fidelity with which they
portray or reflect all the phases of the
life and society which they undertake to
present. Bret Harte has described early
life in California with a similar spirit, if
not with similar success. Simms had
some success in depicting certain phases
of early life in the South; Miss Mur-
free, Joel Chandler Harris, and Thomas
Nelson Page have given us graphic pic-
tures of more modern conditions. Miss
Wilkins has shown with marvelous skill
one side of life in New England; and
Paul Leicester Ford has made a strong
representation of New York political
methods in The Honorable Peter Ster-
ling. But since the publication of The
Spy of Cooper, until within the past
year, unless we except Harold Frederics
In the Valley, there has been no such
representation in fiction of the dominant
characteristics of the war for independ-
ence. For the most part, we have been
obliged to rely, for our impressions of
the life and atmosphere of that great
contest, upon such representations as the
historians have given us. It is not ne-
cessary to impute inaccuracy to them,
unless it be inaccuracy to give such pro-
minence to certain phases of the ques-
tion as to leave a warped and imperfect
impression upon the mind of the reader.
It must be remembered that it is not
from the fuller and larger and more
carefully prepared histories that popular
impressions are derived. They come
rather from the books that are used in
the public schools. This is evident when
we remember how large is the percent-
age of the children who never pursue
their studies beyond the grammar school
grades, and that the masses are obliged
to be content with popular books.
	The school-books naturally present the
most obvious events, and they are hard-
ly to be condemned for failing to point
out the hidden causes which are so often
the potent factors of success and defeat.
Thus, it has happened that certain very
important phases of the war for inde
	VOL. LXXXII.  NO. 490.	12
pendence have received scant consider-
ation by those who have had much to do
with framing public opinion. Moreover,
there is nothing more sure than that the
impressions which a child receives of the
right and wrong of a dispute are difficult
to eradicate.
	One of the erroneous impressions
lodged in the popular imagination is the
supposed unanimity, or approach to
unanimity, with which the Revolution was
undertaken; and there is also a popular
impression, equally erroneous, that the
logical and the constitutional objections
to the Revolutionary policy were weak
and insignificant. The fact is that the
Revolutionary War was a civil war in a
far more strict and comprehensive sense
than was the war between the states
which broke out in 1861. But there has
never been lodged in the popular ima-
gination any adequate impression of the
tremendous significance of those who al-
ways insisted upon calling themselves
Loyalists, but who were early stigma-
tized by their opponents with the oppro-
brious epithet of Tories. Did we not
all receive a nearly indelible impression
from our juvenile reading that the Tories
of the Revolution were men of such thor-
oughgoing badness that simple hanging
was too good for them? It is now fair,
however, to presume that we are far
enough away from that exciting period
to admit, without danger of bodily harm,
that there were really two sides to the
question as to whether fighting for in-
dependence was the more promising of
the two policies open to the colonists.
Until the appearance of Professor Ty-
lers Literary History of the Revolution,
who among the historians had fairly pre-
sented both sides of the case?
	As usual in times of great excitement,
the public was divided by more or less
indefinite lines into several parties.
These may be conveniently classified into
four groups,  two on either side. Of
those who were governors or other offi-
cials of the Crown, and consequently</PB>

were ready to stand by the king through
thick and thin, nothing need be said.
But a second class of opponents to the
Revolutionary movement was far more
important, and is entitled to more care-
ful consideration. Many, while fully
admitting that the policy of the British
government was in many respects bad,
denied that forceful revolt was the pro-
per way to remedy the evils. They be-
lieved, and until the outbreak of the
war they boldly asserted, that a loyal
and persistent support of the party led
by Pitt, Burke, and Fox would finally
result in the downfall of the Kings
Friends and the restoration of the
Whigs, with all attendant advantages.
They declared with confidence that open
revolt would inevitably close the lips of
those who in England sympathized with
the American cause, and would drive all
the members of Parliament to the sup-
port of the government in putting down
what would be regarded as a rebellion.
They declared also that in case of fail-
ure to secure the adoption of this policy
by Parliament nothing would be lost, in-
asmuch as existing evils were far more
than counterbalanced by existing bene-
fits. They pointed out, moreover, that
there was no evidence of a general dis-
position in England to oppress the colo-
nists, and that there could be no lurk-
ing danger in the policy they advocated.
There were many, too, who took the
ground that in any event success by
armed resistance was so overwhelmingly
improbable as to be practicably impos-
sible, and that an unsuccessful effort
would probably augment the evils com-
plained of.
	Then, on the other hand, the Revolu-
tionists, also, may be divided into two
classes. There were those who protest-
ed earnestly against what they regarded
as the oppressions of the mother coun-
try, but who, up to 1775, believed that
reasonable protests would be met with
reasonable replies and concessions. The
leaders of this class were Washington
and Franklin. Then there were those
who at the beginning of the dispute were
out-and-out advocates of resistance, and
a little later out-and-out advocates of in-
dependence.
	It is not strange that the latter class
finally got the upper hand and secured
the adoption of its policy. In times of
intense political excitement it is the
thoroughgoing who are apt to have their
way. It was the Rhetts and the Yan-
ceys who drew Lee and Stephens and
the rest of the reluctant South after
them into the whirlpool of 1861; and
if they had succeeded, they would have
been placed in that category of nation-
founders in which Otis and Samuel
Adams and Patrick Henry now occupy
so lofty a position. After all, as has
often been said, the most important dif-
ference between a revolution and a re-
bellion is the fact that the one justifies
itself by success, while the other con-
demns itself by failure.
	The importance of the Tory element
in the Revolutionary War may be judged
either by its numbers or by its respecta-
bility. Of the exact relative strength of
the Tories and the Revolutionists it is not
now easy to form a very confident opin-
ion. Indeed, at the time of the war, in
the absence of all machinery for taking
a census of Loyalists and Revolutionists,
the most careful estimate was not likely
to be trustworthy. Two facts, however,
are certain. One is that the Tories al-
ways claimed that if a census could have
been taken, or if the question could have
been fairly submitted to an unintimidated
vote, it would have shown that a very con-
siderable majority of the people through-
out the country and throughout the entire
war were opposed to the policy of resist-
ance. The other fact is that those mem-
bers of the Revolutionary party who had
the best opportunity for observing and
judging  men, for example, like John
Adams, of Massachusetts, and Judge Mc-
Kean, of Pennsylvania  believed that
at least one third of the people were at</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00185" SEQ="0185" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="179">	Some Neglected Aspects of the Revolutionary War.	119

all times opposed to the war. Moreover,
it is obviously probable that many were
Loyalists in secret. Indeed, it is well
known that in all parts of the country
and in all periods of the war many were
in the habit of slinking away from the
tar and feathers of the Revolutionists,
and betaking themselves either stealthily
out of the country, or to rocks and caves
and other impenetrable hiding - places.
Thus, the number of real opponents to the
war may easily have been even greater
than was apparent.
	But aside from the opinions of con-
temporary judges, if we look into such
evidences as are now available, we are
forced to the same conclusion. No one
can study the energetic and comprehen-
sive measures of the various legislatures
without seeing that the Tory element
was formidable in numbers as well as in
character. The records in Massachu-
setts show that the Tories were a con-
stant source of anxiety and dread. In
Connecticut the strength of the opposing
element was still greater. In New York
the Dutch and their retainers and sup-
porters were, as a rule, so notoriously
opposed to the war that the Tories in
tho aggregate certainly formed a very
considerable majority of the population.
Here is a typical example. Judge Jones,
in describing the election of members to
Congress in April, 1775, says: The
Loyalists, numbering three fourths of the
legal voters, marched in a body to the
polls, but their adversaries, having col-
lected boys, unemployed sailors, and ne-
groes, threatened all who opposed them.
The result of this process was that a
majority of the ballots cast were found
to be in favor of the Revolutionary
members. But even the methods of
this patriotic mob as portrayed by Jones
were not very successful; for in May of
1775 the New York Assembly passed
resolutions approving of the course of
the British ministry,  resolutions which
gave great satisfaction in England, and
went far to convince the government
that the colonial opposition had been
greatly exaggerated; that it was indeed
insignificant, and could easily be over-
come. In New York city, if Washing-
ton, soon after his arrival from Boston,
had not sent a shivering chill through
the enthusiastic opposition of the Tories
by promptly hanging the foremost of
their leaders, the Loyalist party might
have been so successfully organized as
to have kept the ~tate solid in its sup-
port of the king. It was only this en-
ergetic action of Washington, supported
as it was a little later by the similar en-
ergy of John Jay in judiciously banishing
the most formidable of the Tory lead-
ers, that finally brought the dominant
forces of New York to the support of the
war.
	In Pennsylvania it was long doubt-
ful whether the official support of the
state could be given to the war move-
ment; and that support was never very
thorough or very enthusiastic. What
Dr. Mitchell, in Hugh Wynne, has repre-
sented as the condition in Philadelphia
was the condition throughout the state.
It is perhaps significant that when, not
long after the evacuation of Philadel-
phia by Clinton, Arnold was placed in
command of the city, he found the To-
ries in full social sway, and that he came
so far under their influence as to fall in
love with the most beautiful and accom-
plished of their daughters,  a proceed-
ing preliminary to that alliance which,
years afterward, caused his wife to he
called the saddest as well as the hand-
somest woman in England. His mar-
riage with Margaret Shippen, however
happy from a domestic point of view, yet
gave an additional motive for Arnolds
final plunge.
	Virginia seems to have had about the
same proportion of Tories as Massachu-
setts. In North Carolina, the people,
throughout the war, were nearly equally
divided in their allegiance between the
two Georges. South Carolina was Tory;
and Georgia was so true to its royal</PB>

namesake that the state not only refused
to supply its quota of troops to the Amer-
ican George, but at the moment when the
untoward event at Yorktown upset its
calculations the legislature was on the
point of denouncing the resistance as a
failure, and giving its formal allegiance
to the British side.
	But it was not in numbers only that
the Tories were formidable. They were
even more formidable in influence, char-
acter, and respectability. It was natu-
ral, of course, that they should include
not only the considerable class who
held office under the king, but also a
very large proportion of those whom we
should now ban or bless by calling them
conservatives. Thus it happened that
in the Tory ranks were many clergymen,
lawyers, physicians, as well as college
graduates in general. Before the war,
these men had been considered not only
respectable, but eminent, in their several
callings. Professor Tyler has admira-
bly shown that even in the political lit-
erature of the day the Tories took an
important part. While it must be ad-
mitted that in the production of the cu-
rious concoctions of rhyme and water
which in those days passed for poetry
the Revolutionary patriots took the lead,
yet in elegant, forceful, logical prose, it
is hard to see that the writings of such
Loyalists as Boucher, Seabury, Leonard,
and Galloway were inferior to those of
Otis, Dickinson, Paine, and Adams; nev-
ertheless, their writings have been quite
forgotten.
	But if we turn from literary merit, and
consider simply the soundness or the un-
soundness of their political and consti-
tutional arguments, we shall find that
they are still more worthy of consider-
ation. Indeed, the drift of opinion of
the most intelligent constitutional critics
of to-day, in America as well as in Eng-
land, is toward the view that in their
constitutional arguments the Loyalist or
Tory writers had a strong case. Natu-
rally, the long succession of British con-
stitutional lawyers, from Lord Mansfield
down to Sir William Harcourt, have uni-
formly and almost if not quite unani-
mously held that, according to the im-
memorial custom of the realm,  that is,
according to the British Constitution, 
the enactments of the imperial Parlia-
ment, consisting of Crown, Lords, and
Commons, are constitutionally binding
upon all British subjects. While they
freely admit the authoritative force of the
maxim, No taxation without represen-
tation, they insist at all times that the
maxim never has had, and has not now,
the meaning that was attached to it by
Otis, Dickinson, and the other colonial
writers. They maintain that, in Parlia-
ment, the king, or the queen, represents
all the members of the royal family;
the House of Lords, all the members of
the nobility; and the House of Com-
mons, all the commonalty of the colo-
nies as well as of the mother country.
According to the British theory, every
member of the House of Commons repre-
sents no more truly the people who elect
him than he does also all the other mem-
bers of the commonalty, both in Great
Britain and in the colonies. It was in
accordance with this theory that the great
cities of the manufacturing districts,
which until recently had never sent a sin-
gle member to the House of Commons,
were held to be as truly represented as
were London and York. This doctrine
carried with it the same right to tax the
colonies as to tax the citizens of Liv-
erpool, Manchester, Birmingham, and
Leeds; and the denial of that right by
the colonial orators and essayists ap-
pears never to have made the least im-
pression upon the constitutional law-
yers of the mother country. Even
Burke, who pleaded so eloquently and
vehemently for conciliation with Ameri-
ca, freely admitted, and never for a mo-
ment denied, that the government was
acting within its constitutional rights.
His contention was that, although Par-
liament possessed the constitutional right</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00187" SEQ="0187" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="181">	Some Neglected A.~pects of the Revolutionary War.	181

to impose taxation, it was nothing less
than consummate madness to attempt to
exercise that right, inasmuch as such ac-
tion would inevitably, sooner or later,
result in the loss of the colonies.
	Now, this was exactly the ground
taken by the American rrories, and ex-
actly the opposite of the doctrine pro-
mulgated by the colonial writers on the
Revolutionary side. There were two
dominant notes in the contentions of the
opponents of the British policy during the
whole of the thirteen long years before
the spring of 1776. The first was that
the British Parliament had no constitu-
tional right to tax the colonies; and the
second, that it was the duty of the self-
respecting colonists to resist the exercise
of every unconstitutional act. Accom-
panying these assertions was the em-
phatic and oft-repeated declaration that
nobody sought or was in favor of inde-
pendence. As late as the time when the
first Continental Congress adjourned in
October, 1775, the idea of independence
met with no favor from Washington;
and Franklin, who was then the Ameri-
can agent in London, assured the mem-
bers of the British Parliament that he
had never heard of anybody, drunk or
sober, who favored independence.
	In view of all these facts, what won-
der is it that the Tories, or what may be
called the British party in America, con-
tained within its ranks many of the most
intelligent and the most highly educated
people of the colonies? In 1778 the le-
gislature of Massachusetts banished and
confiscated the property of three hun-
dred and ten of the most prominent of
the Tory leaders of that state. Who
were they? In scanning the list of
names, Professor Tyler significantly re-
marks that it reads almost like the
bead-roll of the oldest and noblest fami-
lies concerned in the founding and up-
building of New England civilization.
Dr. George E. Ellis, some years ago,
pointed out the fact that in that list of
three hundred and ten persons more
than sixty were Harvard graduates.
Nor was this exceptional. In the Mid-
dle States and in the South the Loyal-
ist party contained a large representa-
tion of the graduates of Yale, Princeton,
William and Mary, and Pennsylvania.
Some of these were put to death, some
were banished, and some were driven
into hiding-places, whence, at the close
of the war, they emerged only to be the
targets of contempt and of all forms of
abuse. A careful investigation of this
phase of the contest will unquestionably
lead every student to the conclusion that
the ranks of the Tories contained a very
considerable portion of the most thought-
ful, the most intelligent, and the most
refined of the colonial people.
	That every effort should be made to
destroy the power and the influence of
these people while the war was going on
was as natural as the attempt to make
the cause successful. But, unfortunately,
the severity of public opinion was not re-
laxed at the close of the war. Mr. Gold-
win Smith has pointed out that there
are special and exceptional reasons why
the end of a civil war should always
be followed by amnesty. But there was
no amnesty at the close of the Revolu-
tionary War. A single instance will
serve as an example of the spirit that
was shown. At the final evacuation of
Charleston, after the treaty of peace had
been signed; the departing British fleet
took all the Tories it could carry. Those
who, unhappily, were compelled to re-
main behind were subjected to the utmost
indignities. They were imprisoned,
whipped, tarred and feathered, dragged
through horse-ponds, and finally twenty-
four of their number were hung upon a
gallows in sight of the last of the retiring
British. So strenuous was the public
opinion of the patriots everywhere that
even the protests of officers and other
men of influence were in vain. General
Greene declared that it was an excess of
intolerance to persecute men for opinions
which twenty years before had been the</PB>

universal belief of every class of soci-
ety; and John Jay denounced the in-
judicious punishment and unmanly re-
venge, following the Revolution, as
without a parallel except in the annals
of religions rage in the time of bigotry
and blindness.
	The effect of the spirit so generally
shown in all parts of the country was inju-
rious in many ways. Mrs. Anne Grant,
the vivacious and intelligent Scotch lady
who lived for many years in America,
and then wrote her interesting and val-
uable book, compares the loss of the col-
onies in expatriating the Loyalists after
the Revolutionary War to the loss of the
French in driving out the Huguenots af-
ter the Revocation; and Mr. Goldwin
Smith, speaking of the fact that the ex-
patriated Tories generally betook them-
selves, with all their rankling sense of
injustice, to Nova Scotia, New Bruns-
wick, and the Canadas, remarks that if
a power hostile to the republic should
ever be formed under European influ-
ence in the north of the continent, the
Americans would owe such an event to
their ancestors who refused amnesty to
the vanqnished in civil war.
	There is another phase of the war to
which attention has not perhaps been
sufficiently called, namely, what might
be termed fortuitous good fortune, 
in Puritan phraseology, special provi-
dence. It is military commonplace to
remark that the issue of a battle often
turns upon a very trifling circumstance.
Napoleon used to say that in war a grain
of sand would sometimes turn the scale;
and yet that great commander was a
firm believer in the doctrine that pro-
vidence fights on the side of the heaviest
battalions. But in the Revolutionary
War providence often seemed to prefer
the other side. Several times nothing
less than the Puritans providential in-
terposition prevented a defeat, which
might speedily have ended the contest.
For instance, during the siege of Boston,
although Tories and spies were every-
where, it was never revealed to the Brit-
ish that for several months the colonists
had not ammunition enough for a single
battle. If an assault upon the Ameri-
cans had been made, it is difficult t~
see how the British could have failed of
overwhelming success. So, too, after the
battle of Long Island, when the capture
of the entire American force seemed in-
evitable, the army was saved partly, no
doubt, by the consummate skill of Wash-
ington in bringing the boats together,
but partly, also, by a dense fog which
enabled twelve thousand men, with all
their guns and supplies, to cross the river
without attracting the attention of the
British pickets or the British fleet.
When, a little later, in spite of Washing-
tons vigorous exhortations and the flat
side of his heavy sword, American re-
cruits gave way on the first fire of the
British at Kipps Bay, the whole of his
force in New York seemed to face in-
evitable annihilation. The British fleet
guarded both shores of Manhattan Is-
land, and the British army was above
the Americans, opposite to what is now
the East Thirty-Fourth Street Ferry. All
that was needed to smother the Ameri-
can force, and apparently the American
cause, was to march without delay across
the island, and to hold the Americans
with a large army in front and a naval
force in the rear, as afterward Wash-
ington held Cornwallis at Yorktown.
Howes army was more than twice as
large as Washingtons; but the doom
which the American commander with
the flat and the edge of his sword could
not prevent, the wit of Mrs. Murray,
the resourceful mother of Lindley Mur-
ray, readily averted. Occupying the
Murray country-seat, or mansion, as it
was then called, on Murray Hill, she was
directly in the line of the British march.
The detention of the army for several
hours by her tempting tea and other re-
freshments set before the officers ena-
bled General Putnam, by a rapid move-
ment up the west side of the island, to</PB>

take the American force out of the trap
before it was inexorably closed.
	A still more striking instance of kin-
dred nature was the reason why Gen-
eral Howe made his fatal move toward
Philadelphia in 1777, instead of sending
half of his troops northward to act with
Burgoyne. The British plan of cam-
paign, which resulted in the capture of
the northern army, was so well designed
and so comprehensive in its nature as
to cause the most serious apprehensions.
The plan to attack the Hudson from
three directions  from Montreal, from
Oswego, and from New York  cer-
tainly gave every promise of success. It
failed simply for the reason that there
was not proper codperation of the three
forces. In the absence of Howes co-
operation with Burgoyne, the people of
New England and New York so gen-
erously destroyed the supplies upon
which the enemy depended, and turned
out in such force, as to compel the in-
vaders either to starve or to surrender.
Moreover, St. Leger, even after the
defeat of Herkimer at Oriskany, was
scared away from the siege of Fort
Stanwix by the false report of American
successes. These several failures could
hardly have occurred but for one very
curious incident.
	The war office in London, as is now
well known, having designed the cam-
paign, issued general orders for the three
expeditions; but, in giving preliminary
directions to Sir William Howe, the de-
partment ordered him to await detailed
instructions. These instructions were
duly made out, directing him to divide
his force, and to leave in New York
only men enough to defend the city
against any attacks that might be made
by Washington, while with about half
of his army he was to march north for
the purpose of uniting and co~iperating
with Burgoyne. The plan threatened
to cut off New England from the rest
of the colonies, and also to rescue the
state of New York. It is not easy to see
how it could have failed if carried out
as devised. But the final instructions to
Howe did not arrive. His consequent
inactivity made it possible for Schuyler
at Albany, when he found that Bur-
goyne w~s likely to be taken care of, or
at least was advancing so slowly through
the woods to Whitehall as to cause no
special anxiety, to send Arnold up the
Mohawk to relieve Fort Stanwix and
drive back the invading force under St.
Leger. Arnolds success, it will be re-
membered, was so rapid and so complete
as to enable him to return in time to play
the leading part in the final entrapment
of Burgoyne. Thus, so far as we can see,
it was the delay of the anticipated orders
of Howe that left Burgoyne to complete
isolation and at the mercy of people who
flocked to the standard of Gates.
	But why did not these orders ar-
rive? The reason was not discovered
until afterward, when it was quite too
late. It was found that the papers had
been duly made out for the signature of
the minister of war, Lord George Ger-
main; but the punctilious fastidiousness
of that officer was dissatisfied with the
copy that had been prepared, and he
ordered that a new and fair copy
should be written out before he would
sign it. When this copy was completed
it was placed in the proper pigeon-hole
to await the signature of the minister.
Meantime, Lord George, having gone to
his country-seat, was absent so long that
on his return the order was not recalled
to mind. After Howe, acting in accord-
ance with the traitorous advice of Gen-
eral Charles Lee, had moved toward
Philadelphia, and Burgoyne had sur-
rendered, the order was rescued from
its innocent pigeon-hole to mock the fas-
tidiousness of the minister. Had the
order been sent, who will undertake to
say what its influence would have been
on the fate of the Revolution?
	One other example only will be offered.
There is abundant reason to believe that
the British government, as well as the</PB>

British officers, regarded the war as
practically at an end, when, in the early
winter of 1776, New Jersey had been
cleared and Washington had been driven
south of the Delaware. Howe had re-
ceived his knighthood for the capture of
New York, and Cornwallis, thinking his
services no longer needed, had sent his
portmanteau on board a ship, with the
purpose of embarking immediately for
home. That audacious recrossing of
the Delaware on Christmas night, which
caused Frederick the Great to put Wash-
ington into the rank of great command-
ers, broke up the New York festivities,
and called for immediate punishment.
When Cornwalliss army played the re-
turn move, the Americans were in un-
questionable peril. With the broad Dela-
ware and its floating ice in Washingtons
rear, and a British army twice the size
of his own in front, it is not difficult
to understand why Cornwallis thought
he had at last, as he said, bagged the
old fox. If the British commander
had attacked vigorously on the afternoon
of his arrival, as Washington, Grant,
Lee, or any other great general would
have done, the chances seem to have
been more than ten to one that Wash-
ington and his whole army would have
been taken prisoners. But Cornwallis
was so sure of his game that he made
the most stupendous blunder of the war,
and decided to refresh his men by a
nights sleep. It was a blunder precise-
ly like that which prevented General
W. F. Smith from taking Petersburg in
June of 1864; and it appears to have
been simply this mistake that enabled
Washington not only to draw his army
out of extreme peril, but also to fall upon
the enemy at Princeton early the next
morning, and, by threatening the British
stores throughout the state, to force Corn-
wallis back into New York, and so, at
the end of the campaign, to take posses-
sion of the whole of New Jersey with
the exception of two or three stations on
the Hudson. When Cornwallis finally
surrendered at Yorktown, well might he
express his admiration of the wonderful
skill which had suddenly hurled an army
four hundred miles with such accuracy
and deadly effect, and then generously
add, But, after all, your excellencys
achievements in New Jersey were such
that nothing could surpass them.
	One fact which, in the popular repre-
sentations of the Revolutionary War,
seems often either to have been over-
looked or not to have been sufficiently
emphasized, is the remarkable degenera-
tion of Congress after the war had really
begun. The first Continental Congress
had brought together many of the very
ablest men in the country. The colo-
nies fully realized that questions of the
utmost importance were to be consid-
ered, and they selected the best men as
their representatives. With the possible
exception of the Constitutional Conven-
tion, no other such body of men has ever
yet come together in the history of the
country. Its qualities went far to justify
the remark of the elder Pitt to Franklin
that it was the most honorable as-
sembly since the times of Greece and
Rome.
	But its successor was not of the same
character. Moreover, for reasons which
are not difficult to understand, a marked
deterioration took place as time went on.
As soon as the Declaration of Independ-
ence had been put forth, the people of
the individual states began to think of
organizing their own governments; and
they naturally called into the service of
constitution-making the ablest men they
could command. To adopt thirteen new
constitutions and to set thirteen new gov-
ernments in motion made large drafts
upon the available intelligence of the
country.
	Added to this depleting influence was
the still further necessity of a strong re-
presentation in Europe. One has only
to recall the names of those who were
governors of states, and of those who
were engaged in France, in Holland, and</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00191" SEQ="0191" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="185">	Some Neglected Aspects of the Revolutionary War.	185

in Spain, between 1776 and 1783, to un-
derstand that if these men had been in
Congress they would have furnished a
swaying and a staying power of incal-
culable value. Then, too, the army had
drawn into its ranks large numbers of
prominent men who otherwise would
have been in Congress. Nor can we
forget what may as well be called the
disaffected element. Samuel Adams,
as soon as he had succeeded in fairly
launching the Revolution, was so ener-
getic in the exercise of his doctrine of
state sovereignty that he seems to have
dreaded the power of the confederated
states scarcely less than he dreaded that
of George III.; and consequently he
was an almost unceasing obstructionist
to the cause of military efficiency. The
fiery impatience of John Adams was as
much in favor of the absurd and impos-
sible policy of a short and violent war
in the darkest period of the Revolution
as was the impatience of Horace Greeley
in 1862. Indeed, with the exception
of Gouverneur Morris and John Jay,
none of the members of Congress seem
to have realized that the only practi-
cable way of conducting the war to a
successful close was the patient policy
that was persistently followed-by the com-
mander-in-chief.
	Now, a simple enumeration of these
various facts is enough to show why it
was that the second Continental Con-
gress was so inferior to its great pre-
decessor. When we look into its meth-
ods of dealing with the war, we ought
not to be surprised to find that it was
very far from being that unselfish body
of intelligent patriots into which it seems
to have been converted by the trans-
forming and consecrating influence of
time. On the contrary, it is not too
much to say that one of the greatest
difficulties that Washington had to con-
tend with was the stupid, meddling, and
obstructing inefficiency of those who sat
at Philadelphia and at Yorktown for the
supreme control of Continental affairs.
At some of the meetings of that Con-
gress not more than a dozen members
were present, arid these were often men
of small ability and dogged pertinacity.
It was almost harder for Washington to
persuade  that is, to conquer  Con-
gress than it was to conquer the British.
One who looks through the long and
pathetic series of letters of the great
commander, and studies them with the
single purpose of understanding the re-
lations of Congress to the struggle that
was going on, is likely to be amazed not
only at the wisdom and tact of Wash-
ington, but at the almost infinite stupid-
ities and difficulties with which he had
to contend. The embarrassments that
arose from these relations were partly
political, but they were also largely mil-
itary. New England, though it had
heartily supported Washington at the
beginning, found its courage oozing out
and becoming lukewarm soon after the
theatre of active operations ~vas trans-
ferred to New York. It is not al-
together strange that, while Washington
was being driven from the centre of oper-
ations and steadily forced out of New
Jersey, the New Englanders should point
at what they could do at Bennington and
Saratoga when they were energetically
commanded; or that the New England
sentiment, led by John Adams, had, in
consequence, some sympathy with the
Conway Cabal.
	Neither Bancroft nor Hildreth nor
any one of the older historians has ade-
quately described the strength and the
nature of the prevailing dissatisfaction.
It is only in the light of letters and other
documents that have become available
within the past twenty years that we are
able fully to understand the spirit of the
time. Dr. Mitchell shows that spirit
perfectly when he puts into the Diary of
Jack Gainor these words: Most won-
derful it is, as I read what he wrote to
inefficient, blundering men, to see how
calmly he states his own pitiful case, how
entirely he controls a nature violent and</PB>

passionate beyond that of most men. He
was scarcely in the saddle as commander
before the body which set him there was
filled with dissatisfaction. This expres-
sion of the novelist describes the situation
better than do any of our historians, with
the exception of John Fiske. It may be
added that matters were brought to a
favorable crisis only when Washington
intimated that he might be driven to
resignation, declaring, It will be im-
possible for me to be of any further ser-
vice, if such insuperable difficulties are
thrown in my way.
	Moreover, it was largely the short-
sightedness as well as the energy of
John Adams which led Congress to tol-
erate the policy of short enlistments.
This policy Washington tried in every
possible way to prevent, but his efforts
were only partially successful. It was
not till he failed in his appeals to Con-
gress, and in his individual appeals to
the governors of the various states, that
he finally felt obliged to concentrate
his views in the memorable Circular
to States of October 18, 1780. What
can be more instructive or suggestive
than the following words? 
We have frequently heard the be-
havior of the militia extolled upon one
and another occasion by men who judge
from the surface, by men who had par-
ticular views in misrepresenting, by
visionary men whose credulity easily
swelled every vague story in support of
a favorite hypothesis. I solemnly de-
clare I never was witness to a single in-
stance that could countenance the opin-
ion of militia or raw troops being fit for
the real business of fighting. I have
found them useful as light parties to
skirmish in the woods, but incapable of
making or sustaining a serious attack.
This firmness is only acquired by habit
of discipline and service. - . - We may
expect everything from ours that militia
is capable of, but we must not expect
from them any services for which regu-
lars alone are fit. The battle of Cam-
den is a melancholy comment upon this
doctrine. The militia fled at the first
fire, and left the Continental troops, sur-
rounded on every side and overpow-
ered by numbers, to combat for safety
instead of victory.
	Not only was Congress inefficient in
securing a proper organization, but it
was equally inefficient in dealing with
supplies. Later investigations have
shown that the sufferings at Valley
Forge did not arise from a general in-
adequacy of food and raiment, but from
the fact that the commissariat depart-
ment was so woefully remiss in the
distribution of supplies where they were
needed. It soon came to be known
that at the very moment when thou-
sands of Washingtons troops were freez-
ing and starving for want of blankets
and food an abundant supply was ac-
cessible not many miles away. The
mischief had been done when Congress,
in opposition to Washingtons advice,
reorganized the commissariat depart-
ment in 1777. At that time Congress
decided to divide responsibility, and in
place of Colonel Joseph Trumbull, who
had been the successful head of the de-
partment, it put two men with coequal
authority to do his work,  the one to
make the purchases, and the other to
distribute the supplies. Then, too, as
if for the purpose of insuring chaos, the
subordinate officers were made account-
able to Congress rather than to the heads
of the department. Colonel Trumbull,
who was retained in one of the places,
was soon so disgusted with the inevitable
results that he resigned. Is it strange
that at one time the army was two days
without meat, and three days without
bread?
	The quartermasters department was
scarcely better. It was afterward ascer-
tained that at the very time when, as
Washington wrote, twenty-eight hundred
and ninety - eight men were unfit for
duty because they were barefoot and
otherwise naked, hogsheads of shoes,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00193" SEQ="0193" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="187">	Some Neglected Aspects of the Revolutionary War.	187

stockings, and clothing were lying at dif-
ferent places on the roads and in the
woods, perishing for want of teams, or
of money to pay the teamsters.
	But even worse than all this, those
who provided the supplies were tainted
with peculation and fraud. The his-
torical student, as he gives up the idea
that the legislation of the time was su-
premely wise, must also, however reluc-
tantly, ahandon the idea that the Re-
volutionary period was an age of spot-
less political virtue. Again and again
Washington pleaded with Congress and
with the chief officers of the individual
states. In appealing to President Reed,
of Pennsylvania, on the 12th of Decem-
ber, 1778, to bring those whom he calls
the murderers of our cause to con-
dign punishment, he unbridled his pas-
sion and sent these energetic words:
I would to God that one of the most
atrocious in each state was hung in gib-
bets upon a gallows five times as high as
the one prepared by Haman. The situ-
ation seemed so desperate that, only six
days later, he wrote to Benjamin Harri-
son, Speaker of the House of Delegates
of Virginia, As there can be no harm
in a pious wish for the good of ones
country, I shall offer it as mine that each
state will not only choose, hut compel
their ablest men to attend Congress.
	But Washingtons prayer, for this once
at least, was not answered. When, as
time wore on, the French ministers ar-
rived, they naturally had little difficul-
ty in playing upon the credulity and
simple-mindedness of the members. It
is now well known that the policy of
France in the alliance was twofold.
She not only insisted that the colonies
should not make peace until independ-
ence was recognized, but she was secret-
ly determined that the colonies should
not be so overwhelmingly successful as
to endanger the interests of France
and her allies by including the Canadas
and the territories lying in the West
and South. This latter phase of French
policy, revealed as it has been by the
publication of the correspondence be-
tween the French government and their
ministers in America, has made it cer-
tain that G6rard, Marbois, and Luzerne
employed all those arts of dissimula-
tion, as well as of flattery, which have
been called the mensonge politique.
The letters of Vergennes to the envoys
contain frequent references to donat ifs,
and those of d~ Circourt to stcours tern-
poraires en argent. These expressions
refer unmistakably to bribery, for Ver-
gennes writes to Luzerne, His Majes-
ty further empowers you to continue
the gifts which M. G6rard has given or
promised, and of which he will surely
have handed you a list. The list of
persons here referred to, who were to
be persuaded with money, has not been
disclosed; but Durand tells us that Tom
Paine, who was then the secretary of
the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and
of course knew all its secrets, was en-
gaged by the French minister, for a
thousand dollars a year, to inspire the
people with sentiments favorable to
France. No doubt the rascal earned
his money, but who the other members
were that were thus inspired we do not
know. That such inspiration, how-
ever, was used to a greater or less ex-
tent there can be no possible doubt.
One of the biographers of John Jay re-
lates that, some thirty years after the
events here mentioned, Gouverneur Mor-
ris went over from Morrisania to visit
his old friend Jay at Bedford. During
their conversation Morris suddenly ejac-
ulated through clouds of smoke, Jay,
what a set of damned scoundrels we
had in that second Congress Yes,
said Jay, that we had, and the vencr-
able ex-Chief Justice knocked the ashes
from his pipe.
	But perhaps the most important of all
tbe neglected phases of the Revolution-
ary struggle is the stupendous fact that
Great Britain was prevented from pro-
secuting the war with vigor by complica</PB>

tions in Europe. It would only partially
express the truth to say that England
fought the colonies with one hand tied
behind her, or even to declare that it
was only her left hand that was free.
No adequate impression of the relations
of the forces engaged can be obtained
without keeping constantly in mind sev-
eral all important facts that have too
often been neglected.
	It is necessary to remember that
France had but recently been as bitterly
humiliated by England as she was a
century later by Germany. Those mar-
velous years of the domination of the
elder Pitt had not only converted the
Kingdom of England into the British
Empire,. but had accomplished this pro-
digious result mainly at the expense
of France. It was from the French
that India was taken by Clive and Po
cock, as Canada was taken by Wolfe
and Saunders. Not only was France
stripped of her magnificent colonial
possessions in Africa, as well as in
Asia and America, but she saw her
navy everywhere defeated and dispersed,
and her commerce completely destroyed.
These events had occurred less than
twenty years before the outbreak of the
American war; and the natural conse-
quence was that the hostile feelings of
the people of France toward England
from 1763 to 1778 were quite as intense
as the feelings of the same people toward
Germany during the fifteen years after
the treaty of 1871. Everybody now
knows that if, during that period, Ger-
many had in any way become serious-
ly involved with a foreign power, the
French would have seized the opportu-
nity to wipe out the humiliation that had
overwhelmed them at Sedan and Paris.
Of kindred nature had been the relations
of England and France a hundred years
before.
	But even this was not all. The atti-
tude of England in regard to the right
of search had made her practically the
enemy of every one of the European
powers. While for some years there was
no outbreak, it was evident that nothing
but the utmost circumspection could pre-
vent a hostile alliance of the most formi-
dable character. The fact that Cather-
ine II. was prevented from a declaration
of war only by the earnest advice of
Frederick the Great shows that there was
not a little danger of a general European
conflagration. Moreover, the English
entered upon the American war with a
full knowledge of all this rankling hatred
upon the part of France, and of the
certainty that if at any time the French
should see an opportunity to interfere
with success they would not fail to do
so, and in all probability would draw sev-
eral of the other European nations after
them.
	Nor must it be supposed that France
had been so completely and permanently
crippled as no longer to be formidable.
Indeed, the nation had recovered from
the material disasters of 1759 nearly as
rapidly as, more than a century later, she
recovered from the disasters of 1871.
But, as their strength grew, the French
seemed to remember all the more vivid-
ly that their navy had been ruined, root
and branch, and that whenever a French
merchantman had ventured out of port
it had been pounced upon by some watch-
ful British cruiser. The armed neu-
trality of the Baltic powers had not
yet been directed against the supremacy
of the sea power of England, and con-
sequently not a ship of any nation, sus-
pected of transporting goods out of a
French port or destined to it, was cx-
erupt from search and confiscation; nor
could it be forgotten that it was to coun-
teract this exercise of what seemed like
omnipotence as well as omniscience that
the family compact was made which
bound Spain to declare war against Eng-
land within a year after war was declared
by France. It has not always been re-
membered by American historians that
it was chiefly the discovery of this secret
alliance by Pitt, and the opposition of</PB>

the headstrong young king to the mea-
sures by which the great minister pro-
posed to thwart the alliance, that led to
Pitts downfall, and the substitution of
Newcastle and Bute in his place.
	Moreover, the situation was aggravat-
ed by certain other very irritating con-
ditions. On the one hand, the needless
failure of Byng to relieve Minorca, and
the consequent fall of that important
island into the hands of the French, was
a source of such infinite chagrin to the
English that it could not be wiped out
by the mere execution of an admiral;
while, on the other hand, the possession
of Gibraltar by the British was so con-
stant a humiliation to the Spanish that
an offensive and defensive alliance be-
tween France and Spain was the inevita-
ble consequence of the situation. These
inflammatory elements were so menacing
that Pitt, at one time, made the remark-
able proposal to Spain to give up Gib-
raltar as the price of an alliance for the
recovery of Minorca. The mere fact
that such terms were offered is enough
to show the gravity of the situation. At
least, it may be said that if the answer of
Spain had been different, either France
would never have gone to the help of
America, or in doing so she would have
had Spain as an enemy rather than as
an ally. But, whatever the course of
France, the union of England and Spain
might easily have turned the scale of the
war; for, without the French alliance, it
is impossible to see how the colonies could
have escaped from being overwhelmed
by England and Spain combined. Even
if France were not prevented from the
alliance, her fleet could not have stood
against the united navies of England
and Spain; the expedition of de Grasse
would have been impossible, and the
Yorktown campaign could not have
occurred. Thus, it is easy to see that if
Pitts proposal had been accepted Eng
land might not only have regained Mi-
norca, but might also have retained the
American colonies. Such a result would
hardly have been a dear purchase even
at the tremendous price of Gibraltar.
	The main significance of all these con-
ditions for our purpose is the fact that the
English knew of the discoveries of Pitt;
that they were fully aware that Spain
and probably other European nations
would be allied with France whenever
the French government should see fit to
go to the assistance of the revolting colo-
nies. As is well known, the consumma-
tion of this twofold project would have
occurred much earlier than it did but
for the natural reluctance of Louis XVI.
to assist organized opposition to royal
authority. These conditions, moreover,
explain why it was that while England
had not less than two hundred thousand
men under arms, on land and sea, not
more than about twenty thousand of
them could be spared for the war in
America. They also explain why it was
that England decided to resort to the un-
usual method of using a part of the vast
wealth she had recently acquired by her
commercial supremacy for the employ-
ment of mercenary troops from Germany.
	From the letters and other papers
that are now coming to us in authentic
form and in rich abundance, we are
learning more perfectly than ever be-
fore how it was that the Revolution
was achieved. These revelations seem
likely to teach us that from the begin-
ning to the very end the Revolution was
a far more desperate and a far more
doubtful struggle than the historians
have led us to believe. They teach
us also that it was kept from the disas-
ter that seemed again and again ready
to overwhelm it, chiefly by that watch-
ful wisdom of Washington which, to use
Goethes phrase, was as unhasting and
as unresting as the stars.

	THERE is something enigmatical and
peculiar in the make-up of the Spaniard,

might express it. In trying to fathom
Iberian ways of thought and feeling,
we are frequently forced to fall back on
the supposition of a recent writer, that
there is something Spanish in the
Spaniard which causes him to behave in
a Spanish manner. I remember that
when I visited Spain, a few years ago,
I was somewhat disappointed in the ap-
pearance of the country itself, though it
has all the beauty of line and color of a
land for the most part devoid of turf
and trees. I found, however, an ample
compensation in the interest afforded by
this intense idiosyncrasy of the national
temperament. Abandoning the beaten
paths of travel, I spent several months
journeying over the Peninsula on foot,
from the Pyrenees to Gibraltar. In
this way, I was enabled to get beyond
the French civilization of Madrid, and
penetrate to the old Spanish civilization
which still lingers in the villages and pro-
vincial towns. But even with these op-
portunities for observation I was often
at a loss to formulate my impressions of
the Spaniards. This arose partly from
the strong Moorish and Oriental element
which combines in them so strangely
with European traits, partly from Spain
itself being pre~minently the land of puz-

in the national character a shining virtue
usually goes hand in hand with an egre-
gious fault. In no like area in Europe,
perhaps not in the world, do there exist
guch extremes of dryness and moisture,
heat and cold, fertility and barrenness,
such smiling landscapes and such dreary
desolation. And contrasts such as we
find between the arid steppes of Aragon
and the huerta of Valencia, between the
bleak uplands of Castile and the palm
groves of Elehe, between the wind-blown
wastes of La Mancha and the vega of
Granada, are not without counterpart in
the character of the inhabitants. What,
for instance, can be affirmed of a Cata-
lan which will also hold true of a native
of Seville? I remember that a theatre
audience at Madrid thought it the height
of comic incongruity when a stage valet
declared that he was a mixture of Ga-
lician and Andalusian. ( Yo soy una
mezcla de Gallego y Andaluz.) It is
hard, indeed, to avoid a seeming abuse
of paradox and antithesis in speaking of
Spain, that singular country, which,
in the words of Ford, hovers between
Europe and Africa, between civilization
and barbarism; that land of the green
valley and barren mountain, of the
boundless plain and broken sierra; those
Elysian gardens of the vine, the olive,
the orange, and the aloe; those track-
less, vast, silent, uncultivated wastes, the
heritage of the wild bee; . . . that ori-
ginal unchanged country, where indul-
gence and luxury contend with privation
and poverty, where a want of all that is
generous or merciful is blended with the
most devoted heroic virtues, where igno-
rance and erudition stand in violent and
striking contrast.
	We almost refuse to credit Madame
dAulnoys account of the mingled squa-
lor and magnificence, barbarism and re-
finement, that existed at Madrid toward
the end of the seventeenth century, when
Spain, isolated from the rest of Europe,
was still free to express her antithetical
nature. Throughout nearly everything
Spanish there runs this chiaroscuro, this
intense play of light and shade. In the
history of what other nation do we find
such alternations of energy and inertia,
such sudden vicissitudes of greatness and
decay? On the one hand, Spanish reli-

wastes of La Mancha and the vega of
Granada, are not without counterpart in
the character of the inhabitants. What,
for instance, can be affirmed of a Cata-
lan which will also hold true of a native
of Seville? I remember that a theatre
audience at Madrid thought it the height
of comic incongruity when a stage valet
declared that he was a mixture of Ga-
lician and Andalusian. ( Yo soy una
mezcla de Gallego y Andaluz.) It is
hard, indeed, to avoid a seeming abuse
of paradox and antithesis in speaking of
Spain, that singular country, which,
in the words of Ford, hovers between
Europe and Africa, between civilization
and barbarism; that land of the green
valley and barren mountain, of the
boundless plain and broken sierra; those
Elysian gardens of the vine, the olive,
the orange, and the aloe; those track-
less, vast, silent, uncultivated wastes, the
heritage of the wild bee; . . . that ori-
ginal unchanged country, where indul-
gence and luxury contend with privation
and poverty, where a want of all that is
generous or merciful is blended with the
most devoted heroic virtues, where igno-
rance and erudition stand in violent and
striking contrast.
	We almost refuse to credit Madame
dAulnoys account of the mingled squa-
lor and magnificence, barbarism and re-
finement, that existed at Madrid toward
the end of the seventeenth century, when
Spain, isolated from the rest of Europe,
was still free to express her antithetical
nature. Throughout nearly everything
Spanish there runs this chiaroscuro, this
intense play of light and shade. In the
history of what other nation do we find
such alternations of energy and inertia,
such sudden vicissitudes of greatness and
decay? On the one hand, Spanish reli-
gion in the sixteenth century culminated</PB>

in the Inquisition; and on the other, it
attained to the purest spirituality and
Christian charity in Santa Teresa, Fray
Luis de Leon, and San Juan de la Cruz,
the last of the great mystics, the splendid
sunset glow of medheval Catholicism.
The brilliant literature of the Golden Age
died away abruptly into platitude and
insignificance. Among the masterpieces
of this literature itself we pass with lit-
tle interval from heights of mysticism
and strains of lyric eloquence to the
works of the picaresque writers, recount-
ing the exploits of rogues and vagabonds.
Spanish society, which until recently
had no middle class, suggested to Cer-
vantes the perfect antithesis of Don Qui-
xote and Sancho Panza; and in Sancho
Panza himself, the Spanish peasant of
Cervantes time and of to-day, there is the
contrast between his shrewd mother wit
and his ignorance and credulity. Spain
has left almost entirely uncultivated that
intermediary region of lucidity, good
sense, and critical discrimination which
France has made her special domain.
	Perhaps the first requisite to getting
a clear notion of the Spaniard is to real-
ize in what respects he is not like the
Frenchman. We should not allow our-
selves to be misled by any supposed soli-
darity of the Latin races. In certain
essential traits the Spanish differ from
the French almost as much as the Hin-
dus from the Chinese, and in somewhat
the same manner. The chief thing that
strikes one in French literature is the
absence of what the Germans call In-
nigkeit, of inwardness,  the subordi-
nation of everything in man to his so-
cial qualities; among the Spaniards, on
the other hand, there is vastly greater
capacity for solitude and isolation. In
France, reason, insufficiently quickened
by the imagination, easily degenerates
into dry rationalism; whereas in the land
of Don Quixote the imagination tends
to break away from the control of the
senses and understanding, and is unwill-
ing to accept the limitations of the real,
and then follows the inevitable disen-
chantment when the world turns out to
be different in fact from what it had
been painted in fancy. Engaiic~ and
desengaito, illusion and disillusion, eter-
nal themes of Spanish poetry
	Intimately related to this intemperate
imagination of the Spaniard is his pride,
his power of self-idealization, his exalted
notion of his personal dignity. He is
capable of almost any sacrifice when ap-
pealed to in the name of his honor,  the
peculiar form his self-respect assumes, 
and of almost any violence and cruelty
when he believes his honor to be offend-
ed. The Spanish classic theatre revolves
almost entirely around this sentiment of
honor, which is mediawal and Gothic,
and the sentiment of jealousy, which is
Oriental. It was by working upon his
pride and sense of honor far more than
upon his religious instinct that Rome in-
duced the Spaniard to become her cham-
pion in her warfare against the modern
spirit. He looked upon himself as the
caballero andante who sallied forth to
do heroic battle for Mother Church.
	This self-absorption of the Spaniard
has interfered with his acceptance of the
new humanitarian ideal. Don Juan, in
Moli~res play, tells his valet to give alms
to the beggar, not for the love of God,
but for the love of humanity. In fact,
since the time of Molil~re man has been
substituting for the worship of God and
for the old notion of individual salvation
this cult of Humanity, this apotheosis of
himself in his collective capacity. He
has idealized his own future, and thus
evolved the idea of progress. He has
dwelt with minute interest on his own
past, and has thus given rise to the his-
torical spirit. He has ministered with
ever increasing solicitude to his own con-
venience and comfort, and has sought to
find in this world some equivalent for
his vanished dream of paradise. The
individual has so subordinated himself
to this vast common work that he has al-
most lost the sense of his independent</PB>

value. The individual, said M. Ber-
thelot only the other day, will count
for less and less in the society of the fu-
ture.
	The Spaniard, however, refuses thus
to identify the interests of his individual
self with the interests of humanity. He
is filled with that subtle egotism, engen-
dered by mediawal religion, which neg-
lected mans relation to nature and his
fellows, and fixed his attention solely on
the problem of his personal salvation.
In the olden time, it was not uncommon
for a pious Spaniard, on dying, to de-
fraud his earthly creditors in order that
he might pay masses for the welfare of
his soul; and it was said of such a man
that he had made his soul his heir.
The Spaniard remains thus self-centred.
He has little capacity for trusting his
fellow men, for co~iperating with them
and working disinterestedly to a common
end; he is impatient of organization and
discipline. And so, as some one has
remarked, he is warlike without being
military. We may add that he is over-
flowing with national pride without be-
ing really patriotic. He still has in his
blood something of the wild desert in-
stinct of the Arab, and the love of per-
sonal independence of the Goth. You
would rather suspect, says an old Eng-
lish author, speaking of the Spaniards,
that they did but live together for fear
of wolves. As a public servant the
Spaniard is likely to take for his motto,
Apr~s mol le d6luge, or, as the pro-
verb puts it, El ultimo mono se ahoga
(The last monkey gets drowned).
	In the Spaniards indifference to bod-
ily comfort and material refinements we
find traces of the Oriental and medkeval
contempt for the body.
Le	corps, cette guenille, est-il dune impor-
tance,
Dnn prix ~ m~riter seulement quon y
pense?

However, those happy days of Spanish
abstemiousness which Juan Valera de-
scribes have passed, never to return; that
golden era before the advent of French
cookery, when all classes, from grandee
to muleteer, partook with equal relish of
the national mixture of garlic and red
peppers; when window-glass was still a
rarity in the Peninsula; when, if a tenth
part of the inhabitants of Madrid had
taken it into their heads to bathe, there
would have been no water left to drink,
or to cook those garbanzos (chick-peas)
so essential in the Spanish dietary. But
in spite of the spread of modern luxu-
ry, which Seiior Valera looks upon with
ascetic distrust, the Spaniards still re-
main in the mass the most temperate
people in Europe.
	The cruelty of the Spaniard  or ra-
ther, his callousness, his recklessness of
his own life and of the lives of others 
is another mediawal and Oriental survi-
val; and then, too, there underlies the
Spanish temperament I know not what
vein of primitive Iberian savagery. Ma-
dame dAulnoy relates that on a certain
day of the year it was customary for
court gallants to run along one of the
main streets of Madrid, lashing furious-
ly their bare shoulders; and when one
of these penitents passed the lady of his
choice among the spectators, lie bespat-
tered her with his blood, as a special
mark of his favor. Insensibility to the
suffering of animals, though general in
Spain, is not any greater, so far as my
own observation goes, than in the other
Latin countries. Possibly, medheval re-
ligion, in so exalting man above other
creatures, in refusing to recognize his
relations to the rest of nature, tended
to increase this lack of sympathy with
brute creation. The Spanish peasant
belabors his ass for the same reason
that Malebranche kicked his dog,  be-
cause he has not learned to see in it a
being organized to feel pain in the same
way as himself.
	Closely akin, also, to the Spaniards
media,val and aristocratic attitude to-
ward life is his curious lack of practical
sense and mechanical skill. The good</PB>

qualities of the Spaniards, writes Mr.
Butler Clarke, alike with their defects,
have an old world flavor that renders
their possessors unfit to excel in an inar-
tistic, commercial, democratic, and skep-
tical age. Juan Yalera admits this prac-
tical awkwardness and inefficiency of the
Spaniard, but exclaims, Sublime inca-
pacity! and discovers in it a mark of his
mystic, ecstatic, and transcendental na-
ture. The Spaniard, then, finds it hard
to light a kerosene lamp without breaking
the chimney, much as Emerson made his
friends uneasy when he began to handle a
gun. Unfortunately, nature knows how
to revenge herself cruelly on those who
affect to treat her with seraphic disdain,
and on those who, like the Spaniards, see
in a lack of prudence and economy a
proof of aristocratic detachment. Qui
veut faire lange fait la b~te. After
centuries of mortal tension, man has
finally given over trying to look upon
himself as a pure spirit. (Indeed, in
the case of M. Zola and his school, he
has tried to look upon himself as a pure
animal.) He has been gradually learn-
ing to honor his senses and to live on
friendly terms with nature. The Span-
iard, however, has refused to adjust him-
self to the laws of time and space. He
is unwilling to recognize that the most
sublime enterprises usually go amiss
from the neglect of the homeliest de-
tails. He has failed to develop those
faculties of observation and analysis by
which man, since the Renaissance, has
been laying hold upon the world of mat-
ter with an ever firmer grasp. The
splendid sonorities of the Spanish lan-
guage serve in its poetry as a substitute
for the exact rendering of nature, and take
the place of a precise mastery of facts
in the speech of the orator in Cortes.
The Spaniard is reluctant to mar the
poetry of existence by an excessive ac-
curacy. Steamboats are advertised in
Spanish newspapers to start at such and
such an hour more or less (mas 4 menos).
Procrastination is the national vice. As
	VOL. LXXXII.  ~o. 490.	13
I walked along the alameda at Saragos-
sa, shortly after arriving in Spain, the
words I caught constantly rising above
the hum of voices were, mafiana, ma-
fiana por la mafiana, mafiana (to-mor-
row, to - morrow morning, to - morrow).
In Spain, says Ford, everything is
put off until to-morrow  except bank-
ruptcy. A thing in Spain is begun
late, and never finished, runs a native
proverb (En Espafia se empieza tarde, y
se acaba nunca); and again, Spanish
succor arrives late or never (Socorro
de Espaiia 6 tarde 6 nunca).
	Along with this Oriental disregard for
the value of time there is a dash of Ori-
ental fatalism. I remember once talking
the matter over with an old peasant, as
we walked together over the pass of Des-
pefiaperros into Andalusia. In this ac-
cursed world, he ended by saying, a
man who is born a cuarto (a copper
coin) is not going to turn out a peseta
(a coin of silver). A curious comparison
might be made between this true East-
ern fatalism of the Spaniard, the fatal-
ism of predestination, and that fatalism
of evolution which seems to be gaining
ground with us.
	Another Oriental and medheval trait
in the Spaniard is his lack of curiosity.
Quien sabe? (Who knows?) is the
formula of his intellectual indifference,
just as No se puede (It is impossible)
is the formula of his fatalism. The mod-
ern world is coming more and more to
seek its salvation in the development of
the reason and intelligence; and from this
point of view Renan is consistent in ex-
alting curiosity above all other vir-
tues. Christianity, on the other hand,
may justly be suspected of having insuffi-
ciently recognized from the start the r6le
of the intellect, and at times has inclined
to show a special tenderness toward ig-
norance. Pascal was but true to the tra-
dition of the Christian mystics when he
branded the whole process of modern
scientific inquiry as a form of concupis-
cence,  libido sciendi, the lust of know-

ing. When he felt the rise within him
of the new power of the reason which
threatened the integrity of his medhe-
val faith, he exclaimed in self-admonish-
ment, You must use holy water and
hear masses, and that will lead you to
believe naturally and will make you
stupid. Spain, for several centuries
back, has applied with great success this
panacea of Pascal for any undue activi-
ty of the reason. The abject ignorance
into which she has fallen is the result,
then, partly of Christian obscurantism,
and in part of Oriental incuriousness.
	Which is worse, after all, some of. us
may be prompted to ask in passing, this
incuriousness of the Spaniard, or that
eager inquisitiveness of his antipode the
American, which leads him to saturate
his soul in all the infinite futility of his
daily newspaper? Spain may at least
owe to her ignorance some of that wis-
dom of little children so highly prized by
Christianity. There is more simplicity,
kindliness, and naivet6 in Spain than in
the rest of Europe, writes Wilhelm von
Humboldt to Goethe. Other Western
countries are showing signs at present of
intellectual overtraining. The impres-
sion we get from a typical Parisian
Frenchman of to-day is that the whole
energy of the mans personality has gone
to feed the critical intellect, at the expense
both of what is below and of what is
above the intellect,  of the body and the
soul. The critical intellect of the Span-
iard has been so stunted and atrophied
by centuries of disuse that he has lost
the very sense of his deficiency. Educa-
tion is as truly the last object of his con-
cern as it is the first of the American.
	Juan Yalera, who has analyzed with
great acuteness the causes of spanish
decadence, says that Spains head was
turned in the sixteenth century by her
sudden accession to world-wide dominion,
coinciding as it did with her triumph,
after seven centuries of conflict, over the
Moors. She became filled with a f a-
natical faith in herself, with a delirium
of pride, and since then has hugged
with desperate tenacity, as embodying
absolute and immutable truth, those me-
dia~val forms to which she ascribed her
greatness. In the meanwhile, the rest
of the world has been quietly changing
from a medheval to a Greek view of
culture. It has been discovering that
growth is not in one, but in a multitude
of directions, and that the nation no less
than the individual is greatest which
can take up and harmonize in itself the
largest number of opposing qualities.
France, indeed, has been almost fatally
crippled by her attempt to carry into
modern times the principle of medimnval
exclusiveness. Sainte-Beuve traces to
the persecution of the Jansenists and the
expulsion of the Huguenots a loss of
balance in the French national charac-
ter. It was perhaps no idle fancy that
led the Parisian Nefftzer to exclaim, as
he heard the boom of the German guns
about the city in the siege of 1870,
We are paying for Saint Bartholo-
mews Day! The history of Spain
bears still more tragic witness to the
truth of Emersons saying that exclu-
siveness excludes itself. Nearly all her
skill in finance, manufacture, and agri-
culture departed from her with the
banishment of the Jews and Moriscos;
and the Inquisition shut that intellectual
element from her life which was needed
as a corrective of her over-ardent imagi-
nation and narrow intensity.
	However, modern ideas have fairly
got a footing in Spain during the past
forty years, and new and old have been
arrayed against each other with a truly
Iberian vividness of contrast. This bat-
tle beween medheval and modern is the
favorite topic of recent Spanish literature.
It has been treated, often with great
power, by novelists like Gald6s, Alar-
con, and Valera, and has inspired the
work of poets like Nufiez de Arce and
Campoamor. It is curious, this spectacle
of a nation hesitating between contradic-
tory ideals. Spain looks doubtfully on</PB>

our scientific and industrial civilization,
and in the very act of accepting it feels
that she is perhaps entering the path of
perdition. She does not share our ex-
uberant optimism, and has misgivings
about our idea of progress. She cannot,
like other Western nations, throw herself
with fierce energy upon the task of win-
ning dominion over matter, and forget,
In actions dizzying eddy whirid,
The something that infects the world.

She is haunted at times by the Eastern
sense of the unreality of life. It is no
mere chance that the title of the most fa-
mous play of Spains greatest dramatist
is La Vida es Sueflo, Life is a Dream.
This note, which is heard only occasion-
ally in English, and notably in Shake-
speare, recurs constantly in Spanish from
the Couplets of Manrique to Espronceda.
Wisdom, often for the Spaniard as al-
ways for the Oriental, reveals herself as
some strange process of solitary illumi-
nation, comparable to the awakening
from a dream. The mysterious vir-
gin, she calls herself in Esproncedas
poem, on whom man bestows his last
affections, and in whom all science be-
comes mute.
Soy la virgen misteriosa
De los iiltiinos amores, etc.

Whereas Bacon, speaking for the West,
says that the way of knowledge is one
that no man can travel alone.
	We might augur more hopefully of
Spains attempt to enter upon the path
of modern progress if she had been more
happily inspired in the choice of a model.
Wilhelm von Humboldt, one of the few
philosophical observers of Spain, re-
marks that her greatest misfortune is her
geographical position. All her ideas
come to her through France, and France
is above all dangerous to her. In that
ideal cosmopolitanism of which Goethe
dreamed, each country was to broaden
itself by a wise assimilation of the ex-
cellencies of other nationalities. The
actual cosmopolitanism which has arisen
during the present century has perhaps
resulted in an interchange of vices rather
than of virtues. I have sometimes been
tempted to see a symbol of this cosmo-
politanism in a certain square at Florence
whose fine old native architecture has
given way to a cheap imitation of the
Parisian boulevard; and over the front
of one of these modern structures appear
in flaming letters the words Gambri-
nus Halle!
	In theory, Spain should have sent
hundreds of her young men to German
universities and to English and Amen-
caa technical schools, in order that they
might thus acquire the scientific method
of the Teuton and the practical and
executive instinct of the Anglo-Saxon.
She should have fostered among her sons
an interest in commerce, in manufacture,
and above all in agriculture; they should
have been encouraged to go forth and
reclaim the waste tracts of their native
land, plant forests, and heal that long-
standing feud between man and nature
which in Spain is written on the very
face of the landscape.
	Instead of this, she has turned for her
exemplar to France, to the ideal, infinite-
ly seductive and infinitely false, embod-
ied in Paris. She has been guided in
this choice by her incurably aristocratic
instinct. It is estimated that in the days
of Spanish greatness only three million
out of a population of nine million con~
sented to work; and Spain still remains
a nation of aristocrats. Every true Cas-
tilian still aspires to be a caballero, or
horseman; the Spaniard is unwilling to
come down from his horse and put his
shoulder to the work of modern civiliza-
tion. I find in an old English author the
following judgment on Spain, which has
lost little of its truth: The ground is
uncultivated partly through the paucity
and partly through the pride of the peo-
ple, who breed themselves up to bigger
thoughts than they are born to, and scorn
to be that which we call ploughmen and
peasants. . . . And if you take men of
that nation, before they have spoiled</PB>

themselves, either by getting some great
office at home or else by much walking
abroad, to seek some employment or for-
tune there, you shall find them for the
most part to be of noble and courteous
and quiet minds, in the very natural con-
stitution thereof. Whereas, if you show
them a new and sweeter way of life,
either at home or abroad, it intoxicates
them so with the vanities and vices of
the world that they are many of them
quickly wont to suck the venom in, and
become the very worst of men. So that
naturally I hold them good; and that by
accident and infection they grow easily
to be stark naught.
	The Spaniards, then, have sucked in
the venom of the Parisian boulevard,
and have raised up in their capital a
showy fa~ade of borrowed elegance to
which nothing in the country corre-
sponds. I know of no more startling
contrast, even in Spain, than to pass sud-
denly from some gray, poverty-stricken
village of Old Castile into the factitious
glare and glitter of the Fuente Castel-
lana at Madrid. The highest ambition
of thousands of young Spanish provin-
cials is to swagger about in close-fitting
frock coats, and seek for political prefer-
ment, any meaner occupation being un-
worthy of such noble hidalgos. Govern-
ment places are few compared with the
number of applicants; they are ill paid
and of uncertain tenure, and the office-
holder has little choice except to steal
or starve. The vicious traditions of the
old absolutism have thus united with the
new frivolity to produce in the modern
Spanish official that harmonious blend-
ing of corruption and incompetency with
which we are familiar.
	However, we must remember how lit-
tle these afrancesados, these caf6-haunt-
ing, Frenchified Spaniards of Madrid
really represent the nation. In Spain,
even more than in France and Italy, the
germs of promise for the future are to
be sought anywhere rather than in the
upper classes. Even among the upper
classes, if we are to judge from recent
literature, there are those who do not ac-
cept the French ideal of lhomme moyen
sensuel, who would have the Spanish
character come under certain modern in-
fluences, without therefore sacrificing its
own native gravity and religious serious-
ness. It is encouraging to note in many
of the Spanish books published of late
years something of that robustness and
virility wherein lies the natural superi-
ority of the Spaniard over the other
Latins. Spain has as yet no decadent
writers, no Zola and no Gabriele dAn-
nunzio.
	To speak, then, of the lower classes,
there is a singular agreement among
those who have really mingled with them
as to their natural possibilities for good.
I have found in Spain, says Borrow,
amongst much that is lamentable and
reprehensible, much that is noble and to
be admired, much stern, heroic virtue,
much savage and horrible crime; of low,
vulgar vice very little, at least amongst
the great hody of the Spanish nation.
	There is still valor in Asturia, gen-
erosity in Aragon, probity in Old Cas-
tile. But how far will these old world
virtues of the Spanish peasantry be able
to withstand the contact with nineteenth-
century civilization? Will not the pro-
found poetry of their simple instinctive
life fade away at its touch, and the
racy originality of their native ways be
smothered under its smug uniformity?
Will they be able, in short, to make the
difficult passage from the medimeval to
the modern habit of mind without f all-
ing into anarchy and confusion? More
than any other land, Spain came under
the control of that Jesuitical Catholicism
issued from the Council of Trent which
has poisoned the very life-blood of the
Latin races; which, rather than lose its
hold upon the minds of men, has con-
sented through its casuists to sanction
self-indulgence; which has retarded by
every means in its power the develop-
ment of those virtues of self-reliance</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00203" SEQ="0203" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="197">	Ny Friend Ah-Chy.	197

and self-control that more than any oth-
ers measure a mans advancement in the
modern spirit; and now that the Span-
iards are escaping from the artificial re-
straint of their religion they are left, pas-
sionate and impulsive children, to meet
the responsibilities of nineteenth-century
life. From my observation of the com-
mon people, I should say that already
the power of the priesthood is broken,
that respect for the institution of mon-
archy is undermined, and that there is a
rapid drift toward republicanism joined
to a profound distrust of the present
rulers. The desen~,aito, or rude disillu-
sion, they are likely to experience before
the end of the present struggle may re-
sult in some fierce outburst, boding dis-
aster to the political jobbers at Madrid.
Yet no prudent man would risk a pro-
phecy about Peninsular politics; for
Spain is to pays do limpr6vu, the land
of the unexpected, where the logical and
obvious thing is least likely to happen;
and that is perhaps one of the reasons
why she still retains her hold on the
man of imagination.
	Whatever comes to pass, we may be
sure that Spain will not modify immedi-
ately the mental habits of centuries of
spiritual and political absolutism. In
attempting to escape from the past, she
will no doubt shift from the fanatical
belief in a religious creed to the fanatical
belief in revolutionary formuhe, and per-
haps pass through all the other lamenta
ble phases of Latin-country radicalism.
Yet if space allowed I could give rea-
sons for the belief that there are more
elements of real republicanism in Spain
than in France or Italy. This remark,
as well as nearly everything else I have
said, I mean to apply especially to the
Castiles, Aragon, and the northwestern
provinces, the real backbone of the Pe-
ninsula.
	In any case, those who have a first-
hand knowledge of Spain will be ~loath
to place her on that list of dying na-
tions to which Lord Salisbury recently
referred. She is still rich in virtues
which the world at present can ill afford
to lose. It remains to be seen whether
she can rid herself of the impediments
which are rendering these virtues inef-
fectual. Will she be able to expel the
Jesuit poison from her blood? Will she
learn to found her self-respect on con-
science, instead of on the medheval sen-
timent of honor, and come to rely on
action, the religion of the modern man,
rather than on Maria Santissima? Chief
question of all, will she succeed in tam-
ing her Gotho - Bedouin instincts, and
become capable of the degree of orderly
cooperation necessary for good govern-
ment? Alas! the Spaniards themselves
relate that the Virgin once granted va-
rious boons to Spain, at the prayer of
Santiago, but refused the boon of good
government, lest then the angels forsake
heaven, and prefer Spain to paradise.

and self-control that more than any oth-
ers measure a mans advancement in the
modern spirit; and now that the Span-
iards are escaping from the artificial re-
straint of their religion they are left, pas-
sionate and impulsive children, to meet
the responsibilities of nineteenth-century
life. From my observation of the com-
mon people, I should say that already
the power of the priesthood is broken,
that respect for the institution of mon-
archy is undermined, and that there is a
rapid drift toward republicanism joined
to a profound distrust of the present
rulers. The desen~,aito, or rude disillu-
sion, they are likely to experience before
the end of the present struggle may re-
sult in some fierce outburst, boding dis-
aster to the political jobbers at Madrid.
Yet no prudent man would risk a pro-
phecy about Peninsular politics; for
Spain is to pays do limpr6vu, the land
of the unexpected, where the logical and
obvious thing is least likely to happen;
and that is perhaps one of the reasons
why she still retains her hold on the
man of imagination.
	Whatever comes to pass, we may be
sure that Spain will not modify immedi-
ately the mental habits of centuries of
spiritual and political absolutism. In
attempting to escape from the past, she
will no doubt shift from the fanatical
belief in a religious creed to the fanatical
belief in revolutionary formuhe, and per-
haps pass through all the other lamenta
ble phases of Latin-country radicalism.
Yet if space allowed I could give rea-
sons for the belief that there are more
elements of real republicanism in Spain
than in France or Italy. This remark,
as well as nearly everything else I have
said, I mean to apply especially to the
Castiles, Aragon, and the northwestern
provinces, the real backbone of the Pe-
ninsula.
	In any case, those who have a first-
hand knowledge of Spain will be ~loath
to place her on that list of dying na-
tions to which Lord Salisbury recently
referred. She is still rich in virtues
which the world at present can ill afford
to lose. It remains to be seen whether
she can rid herself of the impediments
which are rendering these virtues inef-
fectual. Will she be able to expel the
Jesuit poison from her blood? Will she
learn to found her self-respect on con-
science, instead of on the medheval sen-
timent of honor, and come to rely on
action, the religion of the modern man,
rather than on Maria Santissima? Chief
question of all, will she succeed in tam-
ing her Gotho - Bedouin instincts, and
become capable of the degree of orderly
cooperation necessary for good govern-
ment? Alas! the Spaniards themselves
relate that the Virgin once granted va-
rious boons to Spain, at the prayer of
Santiago, but refused the boon of good
government, lest then the angels forsake
heaven, and prefer Spain to paradise.

MY FRIEND AH-CHY.

	I FTR5T met him at a port on the
river,  by which shorter but satisfac-
torily definite title all China residents
designate the great Yangtsze Kiang.
	The importance of that magnificent
natural highway few of those who have
not lived in China realize. Flowing
thousands of miles through province af-
ter province, it bears on its rushing cur-
rent hundreds of thousands of tons of
produce yearly, in every conceivable kind
of craft,  from the stately river steam-
ers, which remind one of those which ply
on the Hudson, the ocean-going tea clip-</PB>

pers, the coastwise lorchas, and junks of
every size, down to the tiny sampans;
and every boat bears upon either side a
painted eye, for as any Chinaman will
tell you, Suppose no got eye, how fash-
ion can see; and suppose no can see, how
fashion can walkee? Some day the
river will be written of as it deserves, and
the description of its wonderful gorges
and rapids, its varied beautiful scenery,
its yearly rising and falling, will be as
interesting as instructive. In summer it
often reaches a height of forty feet above
its winter level, inundating cities and
large tracts of land along its banks. It
flows through the finest tea-growing coun-
try, and all the porcelain which is used in
the empire is distributed over its waters.
It is ever changing, ever interesting, and
always picturesque,  seeming to me a
necessary background for my friend Ah-
Chy, as he was a citizen of one of the
river ports.
	Meeting Ah-Chy first as the compra-
dore of one of the largest tea merchants,
who was our neighbor and friend, we
had many opportunities of acquaintance
with him. Tall, handsome, erect, be-
tween forty and fifty years of age, with
the most wonderful command of pidgin
English it was ever my good fortune to
listen to, he was a delight to encounter;
and our interest in collecting porcelain
brought us so often into our neighbors
go-down to inspect fresh installments
that we encountered him frequently. He
had taken a lower literary degree, I be-
lieve, and was eligible for official position
and promotion.
	We were a very small foreign com-
munity,  foreign in China means any
nationality not Chinese,  fourteen all
told; yet a very cosmopolitan little cir-
cle, including English, French, Russian,
American, Scotch, Danish, and German
representatives; and for a time I found

	1  Pidgin is a corruption of the word busi-
ness, and pidgin English is the queer jar-
gon of broken English arranged according to
the Chinese idiom, which, ever since its intro-
myself in one of the most enviable, de-
lightful positions in the world,  that of
being the only lady in the port.
	On the occasion of a great review of
Chinese troops gathered from many parts
of the province, and the consequent con-
gregating of its highest officials who were
the inspecting dignitaries, it came about
that we were bidden to a dinner given
at the residence of Chinas large Mer-
cantile Marine Company to meet these
provincial magnates. The dinner was
served entirely in foreign style, doubtless
because of the wish to honor the foreign
officials present, and to the great delight
of the one lady she was included in the
invitation. Perhaps her presence was
added to make it seem entirely foreign
to the Chinese participants.
	As I entered the drawing-room all the
gentlemen rose, and in response to my
inclination  intended to be very cour-
teous  toward each of the gorgeously
appareled Chinese, and my murmured
Ta-yen hao, each in turn raised his
hands slowly to his face, the right clasped
over the left, while I heard in reply, Tai
Tai hao. I had quite forgotten to ask,
as I had fully purposed, what was the
proper salutation to make on being intro-
duced to such high and mighty person-
ages; but suddenly remembering that I
had always heard my husband addressed
as Ta-yen, and knowing it to be a
Chinese official title, I boldly made my
little endeavor to be polite, and was af-
terward told, to my great relief, that I
could not have done better.
	The Chinese were indeed magnificent-
ly robed. From the official hat (which,
according to their code of manners, it is
discourteous to remove), with flaring
black velvet rim, in some cases crowned
with a beautiful pink coral bead an inch
in diameter, from under which peacock
feathers hung down over the back to the

duction at Macno as the medium of intercourse
between foreigners and Chinese, has formed the
language in which the greater part of the do-
mestic and commercial relations are carried on.</PB>

coat collar; the satin coats, with medal-
lions embroidered in every hue, or per-
haps only in shades of blue, and dark
soft sable linings, a short coat over a
long one of different color; down to the
high black satin boots with their wooden
white-covered soles, they were each well
worth study and admiration. They were
stately, decorous, polite, without even the
shadow of a smile on their faces, which
might have looked expressionless except
for the brightness and intelligence of
their eyes.
	Not so the foreign officials present,
who, as they bowed in response to my
greeting, smiled almost audibly in very
evident enjoyment of the scene. It was
the first time some of the Chinese gentle-
men had been brought face to face with
a foreign lady; and to have that experi-
ence at an official dinner, to see her in
full evening toilette, d6collet6, must have
been a terrible shock to their ideas of
what was convenable.
	When dinner was announced by the
long - coated Chinese butler, the official
highest in rank rose, bowed before me,
and offered me his arm. Rising, I took
it, or tried to take it; for I occupied my-
self all the way from the drawing-room
to the dining-room, through a hall unusu-
ally long, and we went very slowly,
in trying to find out with the tips of my
gloved fingers whether or not there was
any arm inside the wide, satin, sable-
lined sleeve. That there were several
layers of silk under-jacket sleeves, be-
sides, I made sure, and as I neared the
dining-table I had just arrived at what
I thought was solid enough to be an
arm. How I longed to give it just a
little hard pinch to find out if I were
correct! But even if I had pinched it
suddenly and viciously, looking up into
the face of my magnificent escort mean-
while, to find out if .he had felt it in the
least, I am sure he would have made
no sign whatever. He would not have
believed the evidence of his own senses
if they had endeavored to tell him that
a woman, and that woman a foreigner,
was trying to pierce the mantle of his
dignity. Fortunately, my very little un-
derstood duty as the wife of a foreign
official kept me from playing any such
prank, but it was a terrible temptation.
	The deftness and aptitude with which
the Chinese used the new and utterly
unaccustomed knives, forks, and spoons,
in lieu of their universally useful chop-
sticks, without showing that they were
closely watching what ought to be done
with them, was perfectly wonderful.
They simply waited a second or two af-
ter they were served with a course, and,
glancing apparently quite casually round
the table, proceeded to use whatever the
foreigners did and in exactly the same
manner. It was fascinating to watch all
these details, and I found that I had to
keep myself well in hand, for fear that,
in my interest and amazement, I should
be detected observing them, and should
show that I had less politeness than these
quiet, keen - eyed, imitative representa-
tives of one of the oldest and most cere-
monious civilizations.
	The dinner-table was beautifully de-
corated with flowers and leaves laid on
the white table-cloth in many different
designs, surrounding the quaintly shaped
dishes of fruit and sweetmeats. The va-
riety of ways in which a Chinese butler
can adorn a table is endless and marvel-
ous, and was always a pleasure and sur-
prise to me in my own home. In China,
no hostess needs to oversee the arrange-
ments for a dinner-party, but can walk
in with her guests as free from care or
anxiety as any of them, without even hav-
ing looked beforehand to see that every-
thing is in order. Each table napkin is
folded in a distinctive shape, sometimes
imitating a swan or a bird, with a colored
paper eye stuck on either side of the ra-
ther queer-looking head, while a button-
hole bouquet is tucked in at the top,
ready for the guest to appropriate as he
sits down. The carving and serving are
done entirely from the sideboard, and</PB>

there are as many men to wait at table
as there are guests, for each guest brings
his own servant. The butler of the host
looks after the opening and serving of the
wine, deputing the carving meanwhile to
some other butler he can trust. I think
it shows the prevailing honesty of the ser-
vants who are thus gathered together at
every dinner-party (and they are many;
I can well remember dining out eleven
consecutive evenings) that I never heard
of a case of theft. All the domestics of
the household where the dinner - party
was in progress were busy in the dining-
room, pantry, or kitchen, the rest of the
house being quite unoccupied; and as we
never locked up any of our personal be-
longings, it would have been easy enough
for a servant to slip away and help him-
self to anything he might fancy.
	Chinese butlers have, too, a strange
system of give and take, which twenty-
five years ago used to prevail much more
extensively than it does now; in fact,
it was then universal. At the first large
dinner-party to which I was invited  I
went as a bride  I found myself eating
with my own brand-new knives, forks, and
spoons. I stared at them very hard, but
there could be no mistake, for there was
the fresh monogram. I was dreadfully
distressed, but did not dare to say any-
thing. When I reached home I told my
husband rather tremblingly, for I was
quite sure they had been stolen. To my
amazement, he only laughed and said,
Oh, you will get quite used to it very
soon; and when you have too many
guests, you will find that instead of ask-
ing you to get more supplies the butler
will just get your neighbors, and al-
ways make up the deficiency. And so
it proved. I can well remember, once
when my husband had asked eight in
to dinner only half an hour before the
usual time (one for each of the delicious
first spring snipe he had just shot), that
there appeared later a splendid roast leg
of mutton as one of our courses. Now
I knew that we had no mutton, for ear-
her in the day the cook had been be-
wailing the non-arrival of the Shanghai
steamer by which it always came. Turn-
ing to the gentleman on my left, I asked,
Did your steamer come from Shanghai
to-day?
	Yes. Why?
I looked down to the other end of the
table, where my husband was carving the
unexpected treasure trove with very evi-
dent enjoyment. Well, ours did not,
said I, and yet 
He caught sight of the mutton. Oh,
I suppose that is mine, he laughed.
No doubt yours will come to-morrow,
and probably be much better; so I shall
be the gainer this time, and shall enjoy
it all the more.
	The cooks kept very strict accounts
among themselves, I am sure, and we
never suffered by these exchanges, while
it was unspeakably comforting to know
that at any time, if occasion arose, we
could feel quite sure of having our neigh-
bors dinner, cooked in his kitchen and
handed over the wall, provided only we
remembered to invite him.
	Away in a northern port, a party of
bachelors were once enjoying themselves
in a happy, hearty fashion round the din-
ner-table; and among them was a fresh
arrival from Scotland, whose means of
smiling were so capacious that really,
when he laughed, which he did almost
continuously, there was ever present the
old danger of the upper part of his head
becoming an island. There was also a
gentleman who had spent much time in
the interior, and whose knowledge of
Chinese was both profound and varied.
While conversation and laughter abound-
ed, he chanced to overhear a remark
made by one of the boys who was
waiting at table; and, while pretending
not to listen, he soon found out that every
foreigner present was being spoken of
by a nickname which referred to his
personal appearance.
	When the servants had retired, and
the foreigners were enjoying their coffee</PB>

and cigars, the sinologue told the others
what he had overheard, and mentioned
as many of the sobriquets as he could re-
member. The young Scoteimans was
not among them, so he proceeded, next
day, to find out from his own boy
what it was. When he got him into the
room, he locked the door, stood with his
back to it, and told the badly scared
servant he would not let him out until
he confessed. By dint of coaxing and
threats he finally induced the poor fright-
ened Chinaman to blurt out that it was
codfish mouth. The entire appropri-
ateness of the nickname overcame him,
and he shouted with laughter, making the
fitness still more apparent. One of the
funniest parts of it all was to watch the
faces of his friends when he told them
the story, which he did many times and
often. Their sense of politeness would
make them struggle bravely not to laugh;
but when, having reached the climax, he
bestowed upon them the full comprehen-
siveness of his smile, it was absolutely
impossible not to join in the hearty
laughter which he always led with con-
tagious good humor.
	I have often wondered since in how
many other ways we foreigners were
ridiculed by our quiet, demure-looking
domestics. Bat I must get back to my
official dinner, eveu at the risk of being
made fun of.
	Beside me at table, to my great de-
light, I found Ah-Chy, and my husband
nearly opposite. After dinner had be-
gun, one of the Chinese magnates at my
husbands side began telling him an ad-
venture of the previous evening, when
he had accompanied home one of his
colleagues who had imbibed too freely
of champagne. While he was describing
the struggles and antics of his unsteady
friend, I looked up, caught my husbands
eye, and laughed heartily. The official
stared, turned, and asked quickly in Chi-
nese (he could neither speak nor under-
stand one word of English), Does your
honorable wife understand Chinese?
	When my husband answered in the
affirmative, the poor man was painful-
ly distressed and shocked, because he
thought he had been telling an indiscreet
story. He was unnecessarily penitent,
making humble apologies and explana-
tions, protesting that he had no idea
whatever that I understood his language
even a little, else he would never have
transgressed in such a manner. He was
with difficulty persuaded that I was in
reality very much amused, and not in the
least shocked; which in turn must have
upset his ideas, and probably started him
wondering as to the emancipation (he
would have called it something very dif-
ferent) of foreign women.
	Ah-Chy had been enjoying it all, mean-
time, in several ways, and after we had
talked on many matters of local inter-
est I suddenly said to him, How many
piecee wife you just now have catchee
[got], Ah-Chy?
	Just now? Oh, just now have
catchee seven piecee, before time have
catchee eight piecee, one piecee have
makee finish, so just now have catchee
seven piecee.
	Makee finish, what thing you talkee?
I no savey what thing belong makee
finish.
	Oh, makee finish belong all same
you talkee makee die, one piecee makee
die, all same makee finish.
	What side you number one [first]
wife, Ah-Chy?
	Oh, he belong Kwangtung side, you
savey, he no likee stop this side, so he
makee stop Kwangtung, you plenty savey
China fashion no belong all same for-
eign fashion number one wife any time
wantee stop he own home. (There
is only one gender in pidgin English;
everything is masculine.)
	After a little I turned and said laugh-
ingly, Ah-Chy, talkee my [tell me],
what piecee wife you likee more better
just now?
	He threw his head back with a hearty
laugh, and with a twinkle in his eyes</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00208" SEQ="0208" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="202">	202	Mj, Friend Ak-U/4

said, Well, I thinkee I likee number
five piecee more better just now. He
belong good-look-see [pretty] and plenty
young.~~
	You belong all same Bluebeard with
your eight piecee wife, Ah-Chy.
	Who man you talkee? Who belong
Bluebeard?
	Oh, he belong one piecee man, live
long time ago, and he have catchee eight
piecee wife, and by and by he no likee,
so he cuttee all he heads off.
	I no belong all same Bluebeard!
he cried. What for because I talkee
you one piecee wife have makee finish,
you talkee my belong all same Bluebeard?
I no likee you talkee my so fashion.
	I appeased him after a time with
many assurances that I had only been
telling an old fairy tale; but, to my in-
tense surprise and amusement, he went
next day into my husbands office to ask
him, What for your Tai Tai have talkee
my belong all same Bluebeard ? On
my husbands also assuring him that I
was only joking with him, he went away
content, for he also dearly loved a joke.
	The dinner was a matter of so many
courses that I have forgotten all about
them, as just such dinners of great length
and variety were our universal custom,
beginning at eight oclock in the evening,
and often lasting two or more hours.
During the long time we sat at table
Ah-Chy was ever ready to amuse me by
talking on any and every subject. At
times it was wholly impossible for rue to
master the torrent of words in their queer
pidgin English setting, and then I would
laugh and say,  Oh, man, man [slower],
please, Ah-Chy. At which he would
stop, look rather astonished for an in-
stant, smile, and answer, Oh, I savey,
you no savey all I talkee, and go on
again as rapidly as before. The solemn
gorgeous official on the other side vindi-
cated his idea of what was due to his
dignity by treating me with studied
though chilling courtesy. He occasion-
ally handed me a dish of sweetmeats
within his reach, between the courses, as
the only acknowledgment of my inferior
(because feminine) existence.
	My vis-~-vis of the bibulous story was
at first very circumspect in his further
remarks; but I noticed that after he had
himself partaken of several glasses of
the ever tempting champagne (the only
foreign wine the Chinese are univer-
sally very fond of) he forgot his late
embarrassment, and only now and then
regarded me suddenly with a rather
frightened look, as if he had just re-
membered me, and ought to be careful.
The look passed quickly away, but was
upsetting to my gravity, and I found
myself almost laughing aloud every tinie.
It was easy to see that he was a genial
soul, and he seemed thoroughly to enjoy
the chance of talking so unreservedly
with a foreigner who understood him
well enough to be able to give back joke
for joke in his own language.
	Some time afterward, my curiosity 
which was then a source of great distress
to my family and friends, and which now
I wish I had gratified a thousand times
more  led me to desire to see the inte-
rior of a Chinese pawnshop. The great
tall buildings here and there all over the
city, raising their blank walls high above
the two-storied uniformity of the vast
acreage of the other houses, had a sort
of fascination for me.
	Ah-Chy came to my aid. His brother
owned a large pawnshop in the city, and
he volunteered to escort me thither. I
suspect Ah-Chy had had a hand in estab-
lishing his brother in pawubroking, and
had himself a large interest in the con-
cern; for in China as elsewhere this is
said to be an exceedingly lucrative busi-
ness. However that may be, it happened
that one day my husband and I got into
our sedan chairs, each with four bear-
ers, and preceded by Ah-Chy, also in a
chair, were soon swinging along through
the narrow, crowded, wonderfully pictur-
esque streets of the native city. I was
always glad of an opportunity to make</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00209" SEQ="0209" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="203">	Ky Friend Ak-CAy.	203

an expedition into these strange regions,
but I was always a little afraid, and made
it a rule to have my chair go in advance
of my hnsbands; for the coolies went
so quickly, and the crowd was so dense,
that his chair could easily turn a corner
ahead, and in less time than it takes to
tell it I might find myself alone on the
streets, many miles from home, and with-
out the faintest idea how to get back.
The natives never got accustomed to the
sight of a foreign lady, and any shop
we entered was sure to be soon besieged
by an eager crowd, jostling one another
good - naturedly to get a better view of
the stranger.
	Oh, those streets, tbose streets! How
can they be described so that one who
has never seen them can even imagine
what they are like? The highways of
Egypt (Cairo, for instance) have more
picturesque coloring, because of the gor-
geousness and variety of the head-dresses
and clothing of the wearers, gathered
together as they are from every nation
under the sun. But Chinese streets are
unique. The shops, all wide open to the
street, with their endless variety of wares
spread in full view, are hung on both
sides with multitudinous signs of every
length and color, brilliant with gold,
green, or red lettering. There are evil
smells of awful intensity; and the tre-
mendous tide of human life is forever
flowing through. Tinkers of every kind
abound, each plying his craft at the door
of the shop which has supplied him with
something to mend. Here is a carnival
of repairing, cobbling shoes, mending
broken porcelain and glass, riveting um-
brellas. There are women mending and
patching garments for so many cash each,
then moving on with their little bamboo
stools in search of more work; barbers
busy shaving or shampooing customers,
or dressing their hair; men with cook-
shops slung on their shoulders from a
bamboo, one end weighted with the little
earthen charcoal stove, the other with the
stock in hand,  probably cakes to fry in
evil-smelling castor oil; children of all
sizes playing in seeming unconsciousness
of the din around them; beggars in every
stage of filth and tatters. There are Bud-
dhist priests with shaven heads and dirty
yellow robes, and the ever present, ever
empty gourd held out for alms; dogs of
every mongrel type; coolies emptying
into buckets, by means of long-handled
bamboo ladles, the drainage from the
huge kangs sunk in the ground at street
corners; presently they swing the buckets
over their shoulders and stride away, ut-
terly indifferent to the stench they trail
behind; and as if to supplement the coo-
lies task, pigs go grunting along, per-
forming their office of scavengers. All
these and more are crowded together in
streets only wide enough to allow two
sedan chairs to pass each other.
	When an official goes abroad in his
chair, he usually has a coolie who runs
ahead  run he must, for the chair-
bearers keep up a wonderfully fast gait
 and shouts at the top of his voice,
Chia Quang Ah! which means, I be-
lieve, Give light, give light, and is
the polite form of saying, Make way,
there. I only hope it is more cour-
teous than it sounds, but it certainly
makes the pedestrians scuttle into the
open shops to get out of the way. So
heralded, we brushed through the nar-
row streets on our visit to the pawnshop.
When we entered the huge building I was
almost appalled at its size, and amazed
at the order and cleanliness of its vast
interior. On the long rows of shelves,
running up to a great height, with little
passageways between, there were thou-
sands upon thousands of bundles, each
carefully wrapped up, the little tag with
its number hanging in full view from the
end. The intense silence and the dim
light made it so eerie that I was glad to
get out into the sunlight again and hear
Ali-Chys cheery flow of pidgin English.
	I have been told that at the beginning
of summer the wealthy Chinese all pawn
their furs, of which they have an enor</PB>

mous number and variety; redeeming
them when the cold weather returns. Out
of these pawnshops come a great many
of the curios which foreigners find at
the shops in the native cities. They are
pledged very often by decaying Chinese
families, and never redeemed; after a
certain length of time  I have forgot-
ten just how long Ah-Chy said it was 
the pawnbroker is allowed to sell them.
When summer came, Ah-Chy frequent-
ly urged us to visit him at his house on
an island in the lake near the city; and
little knowing the pleasant things in store
for us, we started one hot afternoon with
some foreign gentlemen friends to see his
summer home. As we stepped out of our
boat we found ourselves on what seemed
to be enchanted ground. No description
can do justice to the beauty of the little
island. We walked up by tiny circui-
tous paths from the marble steps where
the waves twinkled against the white
stone. At every turn there were de-
lightful surprises: a miniature landscape
with tiny lakes, little rivulets and water-
falls, the daintiest of fairy bridges, toy
summer-houses perched in nooks on arti-
ficial mountains scarcely twelve inches
high; and out of every crevice peeped
delicate maidenhair ferns, tiny shrubs,
and wee wild flowers. It made an ex-
quisite animated willow - pattern plate
scene, and oh, so beautiful! On every
side were these artificial landscapes,
blended so ingeniously with the natu-
ral beauties that it was often impos-
sible to tell where the one ended and
the other began. Here was an ever-
green shrub trained on a wire frame to
represent a deer, life-size, with head and
horns of colored clay, looking strangely
queer as they poked out of the body of
living green; there were men and wo-
men of the same growing shrub, in na-
tive costume, life - size, with heads and
hands placed in the proper position, and
looking, it must be confessed, exceed-
ingly grotesque. Dotted here and there
were porcelain barrel - shaped garden-
seats of every hue, and immense bowls,
beautifully decorated, full of water, in
which swam the lovely little gold and
silver fish of which the Chinese are so
fond.
	With so many claims to our admira-
tion on every hand, we went slowly up
to the house on the highest part of the
island. We were delighted to find that
from one balcony we could look straight
down into the lake below, and also away
to the magnificent range of mountains
beyond. From that side there was no-
thing whatever to remind us of the great
toiling city which lay just behind us, and
the view was exceedingly grand.
	At the invitation of our courteous,
smiling host we entered the house. Every-
thing was in the most orthodox Chinese
style; all the furniture, most elaborate
in design, very stiffly arranged. After
admiring the many beautiful bronzes,
cloisonn6 porcelains, embroideries, lan-
terns, etc., we were taken into our hosts
bedroom, where there was a magnificent
Ningpo canopied bedstead, carved and
inlaid with ivory. The sides and foot
were in the shape of an enormous circle,
the corners filled in with open carved
wood and ivory. The blankets were
laid in long, straight, narrow folds at
the foot of the bed, and the pillows and
mat were of the finest woven cane.
	After praising everything most enthu-
siastically, I turned suddenly to Ah-Chy
and said, This belong your room?
	Yes. You thinkee belong number
one handsome?
	Yes, indeed; but what side your
six piecee wife have got? I no can see
any room this side belong your wife.
	He drew himself up very quickly to
his full height of over six feet (I am
only five feet two inches), raised his arm,
and, pointing to another pretty building
of which we could just see the irregu-
lar skyline above the trees and shrubs,
said in a tone of perfectly indescribable
scorn, Have got that side. Suppose my
wantee, my sendee; talkee he come.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00211" SEQ="0211" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="205">	lily Friend Ah-Chy.	205
	Oh! I gasped. Then, pretending
to shake in my shoes with fear and con-
sternation, I said, I am plenty glad I
no belong China wife, Ah-Chy. I no
likee any man talkee my so fashion.
	His face broke into a smile; he really
had looked very angry as he answered
me. iNow, turning to me with the most
courteous inclination, he paid me the preP
tiest compliment I have ever received:
Tai Tai, suppose my could catchee one
piecee wife all same you, one piecee can
do, and my all time likee he stop this
side.
	The repartee was so quick and so per-
fect that we were all taken by surprise,
and my friends and husband greeted it
with acclamation. Upon my laughing
protest that I could never believe myself
capable of equaling eight piecee wife,
he began, to my dismay, to enumer-
ate my accomplishments, beginning with,
You makee number one music, makee
ridee bobbery [frisky] pony, and, abet-
ted by the encouragement and laughter
of my friends, went on through a long
list up to the climax, which he reached
ia saying, You just now plenty young
and have catchee two piecee boy. That
appealed to him most, for his own two
sons had died, and he had been obliged
to adopt one, in order to insure a de~.
scendant who would worship at his grave
and keep his memory green. It is the
greatest misfortune and sorrow a China-
man knows to be sonless, and I felt my
heart deeply touched with pity for the
man, in the midst of the badinage and
fun in which we were all engaged.
	Meantime, we had been sauntering
through the rooms, and found ourselves
again in the large cool salon overlook-
ing the lake, where we rested and did
ample justice to the champagne, crys-
tallized fruits, and cakes awaiting us.
Then the gentlemen lighted their cigars
and I a cigarette, to the delight of our
host, who congratulated me, saying, Ah,
Tai Tai, you can smokee all same China
wife.
	Yes, but my no can smokee pipe,
Ah-Chy.
	Maskee [no matter]. Cigarette more
better look see. My thinkee by an by
China lady savey smokee allo same.
	Before we left, Ah-Chy took us to see
his dwarfed fir, a tiny but perfect tree,
about nine inches high, which grew in
a beautiful porcelain flower-pot, standing
on a garden-seat, evidently in a place of
honor, and showing evidence of the great-
est care and attention. He told us it
had been planted by his father on the
day his son Ah-Chy was born, and it
was easy to see that he held it in the
greatest veneration. He added quite
seriously that when he had been ill the
little tree had drooped and pined, recov-
ering always as he grew better, and that
when he died it would die too. It cer-
tainly looked then as fresh and healthy
in its tiny way as our host in his vigor-
ous manhood, and we sincerely congratu-
lated him upon its flourishing condition.
He seemed much pleased and touched
by our expressing the hope that it would
be many a long year before there was
any evidence that less fortunate days had
come upon either of them. We strolled
down to the lake by another exquisite
pathway, and, after thanking our host
for the pleasure of the afternoon, rowed
away into the sunset, leaving him gazing
after us with manifest kindliness and
good will.
	Among the pleasant recollections of
our leave - taking of the port are Ah-
Chys regrets that we were going away,
and his warmly expressed hope that we
might be ordered back again before long~
Several years afterward, while we were
stationed at a southern port, I was much
astonished at seeing our usually very
solemn-faced butler appear at the draw-
ing-room door with a comical smile. It
was instantly explained by the announce-
ment, Tai Tai, Ah-Chy have got (is
here); and in walked my old friend,
looking just as well and happy as ever.
I chaffed him about being tied to his</PB>

number one wifes apron-strings by at
least one thread, in spite of the attrac-
tiveness of some of the six piecee
away up the river. He laughed, and ad-
initted having come south to see her,
saying, Must wantee come every two or
three year, makee look see how fashion
have got (how she is). After a long
talk over old times, in what seemed to
me more rapid pidgin English than I
had ever heard even him use, Ah-Chy
bade me good-by, reiterating the hope
that we might be ordered back to our
former home.
	So out of my life passed my friend;
and as I end this little sketch of him I
am very conscious that I am loath to fin-
ish it. It seems like breaking one of the
links which bind me to the old happy, in-
teresting life of which he formed a part.
Every remembrance of him is pleasant,
courteous, and amusing, so that it is not
surprising that I am sorry to take leave
of my friend Ah-Chy.

WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD.

I.

	iT was a strange crew for the fore-
castle of an outward-bound, deep-water
American ship. Mr. Jackson, the mate,
 a gray-eyed giant,  looked in vain
for the heavy foreign faces, the greasy
canvas jackets and blanket trousers, he
was accustomed to see. Not that these
men seemed to be landsmen; each car-
ried in his face and bearing the indefi-
nable something by which sailors of all
races may distinguish one another from
fishermen, tugmen, and deck bands.
They were all young men, and their in-
telligent faces  blemished more or less
by marks of overnight dissipationwere
as sunburned as those of the two mates
who were taking their individual mea-
sures. Where a hand could be seen, it
showed as brown and tarry as that of
the ablest of able seamen. There were
no chests among them, but the canvas
clothes-bags were the genuine article,
and they shouldered and handled them
as only sailors can. Yet, aside from
these externals, they gave no sign of be-
ing anything but well-paid, well-fed, self-
respecting citizens, who would read the
papers, discuss politics, raise families,
and drink more than was proper on pay
nights, to repent at church in the morn-
ing. The hands that were hidden were
covered with well-fitting gloves, kid or
dogskin. All had on white shirts and
fashionable neckwear; their shoes were
polished, their hats in style, and here and
there, where an unbuttoned, silk-faced
overcoat exposed the garment beneath,
could be seen a gold watch-chain with
tasty charm.
	Now, boys, said the shipping-mas-
ter cheerily, as he unfolded the Articles
on the capstan-head, answer and step
over to starboard as I call your names.
Ready! Tosser Galvin.
	Here! A man carried his hag
across the deck.
	Bigpig Monahan.
	Another, as large a man as the make,
answered and followed.
	Moccasey Gill.
	Good God! muttered the mate as
this man responded.
	Sinful Peck.
	An undersized man with a cultivated
blonde mustache lifted his hat politely to
the first officer, disclosing a smooth, bald</PB>

head, and passed over, smiling sweetly.
Whatever his character, his name belied
his appearance; for his face was cheru-
bic in its innocence.
	Say, interrupted the mate angrily,
what kind of a game is this, anyhow?
Are these men sailors?
	Yes, yes, Mr. Jackson, answered
the shipping-master hurriedly; you 11
find em all right. And, Sinful, he add-
ed, as he frowned reprovingly at the last
man named, dont you get gay till my
receipt is signed and I in clear of you.
	Mr. Jackson wondered, but subsid-
ed, and, each name bringing forth a re-
sponse, the reader called off Seldom Hel-
ward, Shiner OToole, Senator Sands,
Jump Black, Yampaw Gallegher, Ghost
OBrien, Sorry Welch, Yorker Jimson,
General Lannigan, Turkey Twain, Gun-
ner Meagher, and Poop-Deck Cahill.
	Then the astounded Mr. Jackson broke
forth profanely. I ye been shipmates,
he declared between oaths, with freak
names of all nations, but this gang beats
me. Say, you, he called, you with
the crojack eye, there,  what s that
name you go by? Who are you ? He
spoke to the large man who had an-
swered to Bigpig Monahan, and who
suffered from a slight distortion of one
eye.
	But, instead of civilly repeating his
name, the sailor said curtly and coolly,
I m the man that struck Billy Patter-
son.
	Fully realizing that the mate who
hesitates is lost, and earnestly resolved
to rebuke this man as his insolence re-
quired, Mr. Jackson secured a belaying-
pin, and had almost reached him when
he found himself looking into the bore
of a pistol held by the shipping-master.
	Now stop this, said the latter firm-
ly,   stop it right here, Mr. Jackson.
After you ye signed my receipt for
em you can do as you like; but if
you touch one of em fore you ye signed,
I 11 have you up fore the commissioner.
And you fellers, he said over his shoul
der, you keep still and be civil till I m
clear o you. I ye used you well,  got
your berths and charged you nothin.
All I wanted was to get Capn Benson
the right kind of a crew.
	Let s see that receipt, snarled the
mate. Put up that gun, too, or I 11
show you one of my own. I 11 tend to
your good men when you get ashore.
He glared at the quiescent Bigpig, and
followed the shipping - master  who,
however, still held his pistol ready 
over to the rail, where the receipt was
produced and signed.
	Away you go, now,  you and your
gun, said the mate.
	The shipping-master, with a good-by
call to the crew, scrambled down the
side to the waiting tug, which then ga-
thered in its lines and steamed away.
	Wrathful of soul, Mr. Jackson turned
to the men. They had changed their
position; they were now close to the fife-
rail at the mainmast, surrounding Bigpig
Monahian, who, with an injured expres-
sion, was shedding outer garments and
voicing his opinion of Mr. Jackson. He
had dropped a pair of starched cuffs
over a belaying-pin and was rolling up
his shirt-sleeves, and Mr. Jackson was
just about to interrupt the discourse,
when the second mate called his name.
Turning, he beheld him beckoning vio-
lently from the cabin companionway, and
joined him.
	Got your gun, Mr. Jackson? asked
the second officer anxiously, as he drew
him within the door. I ye got mine.
I cant make that crowd out ; but they re
lookin for fight,  that s plain. When
you were at the rail they were sayin,
Soak him, Bigpig. Paste him, Bigpig.
Put a head on him. They might be a
lot o prize-fighters.
	Mr. Becker, squat, broad, and hairy,
was not afraid,  his duties forbade it;
he was simply human and confronted
with a new problem.
	 Dont care a rap what they ~
answered the mate. We 11 overhaul</PB>

their dunnage for whiskey and sheath-
knives and turn them to. Come on;
I m heeled.
	They stepped out and advanced to
the capstan amidships, each with a hand
in his trousers pocket.
	Pile those bags against the capstan
here and go forrard! ordered the mate
in his most officer-like tone.
	Go to hl, they answered 
What for  They re our bags, not
yours  Who in hl are you, anyhow
 What are you  You talk like a
pliceman.
	Before this irreverence could he re-
plied to, Bigpig Monahan advanced.
	You re spoilin for somethin, old
horse, he said. Put up your hands.
He threw himself into an aggressive at-
titude, one big fist within six inches of
Mr. Jacksons nose.
	Go forrard! roared the officer, his
gray eyes sparkling.
	We 11 settle this, then we 11 go f or-
rard. There 11 be fair play,  these
men 11 see to that; you 11 only have
me to handle. Put up.
	Mr. Jackson did not put up. He
repeated his order, and was struck on the
nose; not a hard blow,  a preliminary
tap which started blood. He immedi-
ately drew his pistol and shot the man,
who fell with a groan.
	An expression of shock and horror
overspread the face of every man in the
crew, and they surged hack, away from
that murderous pistol. A momentary
hesitancy fol~owed; then horror gave
way to furious rage, and carnage began.
Coats were flung off, belaying-pins and
capstan-bars seized. Inarticulate, half-
uttered imprecations drowned the storm
of abuse with which the mates justified
the shot; and two distinct bands of men
swayed and zigzagged about the deck,
the centre of each an officer fighting ac-
cording to his lights,  shooting as he
could between blows of fists and clubs.
Then the smoke of battle thinned, and
two men with sore heads and bleeding
faces retreated hurriedly to the cabin,
followed by snarling maledictions and
threats.
	It was hardly a victory for either side.
The pistols were empty and the fight was
taken out of the mates for a time, and
on the deck lay three moaning men,
while two others clung to the fife-rail,
draining blood from limp, hanging arms.
But eleven sound and angry men were
left, and the mates had more ammuni-
tion. They entered their rooms, mopped
their faces with wet towels, reloaded their
firearms, pocketed the remaining car-
tridges, and returned to the deck, the
mate carrying a small ensign.
	We 11 run it up to the main, Beck-
er, he said thickly,  for he suffered,
 ignoring in his excitement the eti-
quette of the quarter deck.
	Ay, ay, said the other, equally
unmindful of his breeding. Will we
go for em again? The problem had
defined itself to Mr. Becker: these men
would fight, but not shoot.
	No, no, answered the mate, not
unless they go for us and it s self-de-
fense. They re not sailors; they dont
know where they are.~~
	So, while the uninjured men were as-
sisting the wounded five into the fore-
castle, the police flag was run up to the
main truck, and the two mates retired
to the poop-deck to wait and watch.
	But either because the ship lay too
far over on the Jersey flats for the flag
to be noticed, or because harbor police
share the fallibility of their shore bre-
thren in being elsewhere when wanted,
no shiuy black steamer with blue-coated
guard appeared to investigate the trou-
ble, and it was well on toward noon be-
fore a tug left the beaten track to the
eastward and steamed over to the ship.
The officers took her lines as she came
alongside, and two men climbed the side
ladder,  one a Sandy Hook pilot, the
other the captain of the ship.
	Captain Benson, in manner and ap-
pearance, was as superior to the smooth-</PB>

shaven arid manly-looking Mr. Jackson
as the latter was to the misformed and
hairy second mate. With his fashion-
ably cut clothing, steady blue eye, and
refined features, he would have been
taken for au easy-going club man or edu-
cated army officer rather than the mas-
ter of a working craft. Yet there was
no lack of seamanly decision in the leap
he made from the rail to the deck, or in
the tone of his voice as he demanded,
What s the police flag up for, Mr.
Jackson?
	Mutiny, sir. They started in to
lick us, and we ye shot five.
	Lower that flag at once.
	Mr. Becker obeyed this order; and as
the flag fluttered down, the captain re-
ceived an account of the crews misdoing
from the mate. He stepped into his
cabin, and, returning with a double-bar-
reled shot - gun, leaned it against the
booby-hatch, and said quietly, Call all
hands aft who can come.
	Mr. Jackson delivered the order in a
roar, and the eleven men, who had been
watching the newcomers from the fore-
castle doors, straggled aft and clustered
near the capstan, all of them hatless and
coatless, shivering palpably in the keen
December air. With no flinching of
the eyes, they stared at the captain and
the pilot.
	Now, men, said Captain Benson,
what s the matter with you?
	A red - haired, Roman - nosed man
stepped out of the group. Are you the
captain here? There s matter enough,
he answered defiantly. We ship for
a run down to Rio Janeiro and back
in a big schooner, and here we re put
aboard a square - rigged craft that we
dont know anything about, and the stew-
ard says she s bound for Callao. And
fore we re here ten minutes we re
howled at and shot. Bigpig Monahan s
got a hole iu his shoulder big enough to
shove his fist in,  thinks he s goin to
die. He s bleedin  they re all bleed-
in  like stuck pigs. Sorry Welch and

Turkey Twain ye got broken arms, and
Jump Black and Ghost OBrien got it
in the legs and cant stand up. What
kind o work is this, anyhow?
	That s perfectly right. You were
shot for assaulting your officers. Do
you call yourself able seamen, knowing
nothing of square-rigged craft?
	We re able seamen on the lakes.
We can do our work in schooners.
	Captain Bensons lips puckered, and
he whistled softly. The lakes! said
he. What part of the lakes?
	All o them. We live in Oswego;
we re all union men.
	The captain took a turn or two along
the deck, then faced them and said:
Men, I ye been fooled as well as you.
I would not have an Oswego sailor
aboard my ship if I could help it, much
less a whole crew of them. I ye been
on the lakes, and know the aggressive
self-respect of your breed. Although I
paid five dollars a man for you, I d put
you ashore and ship a new crew but for
the fact that five wounded men going
out of a ship will involve explanation
that will delay my sailing and incur ex-
pense to my owners. However, I give
you the choice,  to go to sea and learn
your work uncter the officers, or go to jail
as mutineers; for to protect my mates I
must prosecute you all.
	Spose we do neither?
	You will probably be shot, to the
last resisting man, either by us or the
harbor police. You are up against the
law.
	They looked at one another with vary-
ing expressions on their faces; then one
asked, What about the bunks? There 5
no bedding.
	If you failed to bring your own, you
will sleep on the bunk-boards.
	And that stiukin swill the China-
man s cookin in the galley,  is that for
us ?
	You will get the provisions provided
by law,  no more; and you will eat in
the forecastle. Also, if you have neg</PB>

lected to bring pots, pans, and spoons,
you will eat without them. This is not
a lake vessel, where sailors eat in the
cabin, with knives and forks. Decide
this matter quickly.
	The captain began pacing the deck,
and the listening pilot stepped forward
and said kindly, Take my advice, boys,
and go along. You re in for it, if you
(lont.
	They thanked him with their eyes for
the sympathy, and conferred together for
a few moments; then their spokesman
called out, We 11 leave it to the fel-
lers forrard, capn, and forward they
trooped. In five minutes they were back,
with resolution in their faces.
	We 11 go, capn, their leader said.
Bigpig cant be moved without its kill-
in him, and says if he lives he 11 fol-
low your mate to hell, but he 11 pay him
back, and the others talk the same way;
we 11 stand by em, we 11 square up
this days work.
	Mr. Jackson, said the captain,
overhaul their dunnage, turn them to,
and man the windlass.
	And so, with a crippled crew of
schooner sailors, the square-rigger Al-
mena towed to sea,  smouldering re-
bellion in one end of hey, the power of
the law in the other, murder in the heart
of every man on board.


II.

	Five months later, the Almena lay
at an outer mooring - buoy in Callao
Roads, again ready for sea, but waiting.
Beyond the faint land and sea breeze
there had been no wind for several days,
and Captain Benson had taken advan-
tage of the delay to give a dinner to
some captains with whom he had frater-
nized on shore. I ye a first-rate stew-
ard, he had told them, and I ye the
best trained crew that ever went to sea.
Come, all of you, and bring your first
officers. I want to give you an object
lesson on the influence of matter over
mind that you cant learn in the books.
	So they came, at half past eleven, in
their own ships dingeys, which were
sent back with orders to return at night-
fall,  six big-fisted, more or less fat
captains, and six hig-fisted, beetle-browed,
and embarrassed first mates. As they
climbed the gangway they were met by
Captain Benson and led to the poop, the
only dry and clean part of the ship; for
the Almenas crew were holystoning the
main deck. This operation consists of
grinding off the oiled surface of the
planks with sandstone, and the resulting
slime of sand, oily wood pulp, and salt
water made walking unpleasant, as well
as being very hard on polished shoe
leather. But in this filthy mess the men
were on their knees, working the six-
inch blocks of stone technically called
bibles back and forth with about the
speed and motion of an energetic woman
over a wash-board. The mates also were
working. With legs clad in long rub-
ber boots, they filled buckets at the deck-
pump and splashed water around where
needed, occasionally throwing the whole
bucketful at a doubtful spot on the deck
to expose it to criticism. As the visitors
lined up against the monkey-rail and
looked down on the scene, Mr. Becker
threw a bucketful,  as only a second
mate can,  and a man who happened
to be in the way was rolled over by the
unexpected impact.
	Get out o the way, there! he bawled,
eying the man sternly. What are you
gruntin at? Water wont hurt you, 
soap neither. He went to the pump
for more water, and the man, gasping
and choking slightly, crawled back to
his holystone. It was Bigpig Monahan,
hollow - eyed and thin, slow in his vol-
untary movements; without his look of
injury, too,  as though he might have
welcomed the momentary respite for his
aching muscles.
	Now and then, when the officers backs
were partly turned, a man would stop,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00217" SEQ="0217" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="211">	Where Angels Fear to Tread.	211

rise erect on his knees and bend back-
ward. A man may work a holystone
much longer and press it much harder
on the deck for these casual stretch-
ings of contracted tissue; but the two
mates chose to ignore this physiological
fact, and a moment later a little man,
caught in the act by Mr. Jackson, was
also rolled over  not by a bucket of
water; by the boot of the mate, who
uttered words suitable to the occasion
and held his hand in his trousers pocket,
while the little man, grinning with rage,
resumed his work.
	There, said Captain Benson to his
guests, see that little devil? See him
show his teeth? That is Sinful Peck.
I ye had him in irons with a broken
head five times, and the log is full of
him. I towed him over the stern run-
ning down the trades to take the cussed-
ness out of him, and if he had nt been
born for higher things hed have been
drowned.
	So this is your trained crew, is it,
captain? said a grizzled old skipper of
the party. What ails that fellow down
in the scuppers?
	Ran foul of the big end of a hand-
spike, answered Captain Benson. He
11 carry his arm in splints all the way
home, I think. His name is Gunner
Meagher. Their names are unique, but
they signed them and will answer to
them. Look at that outlaw down there
by the bitts: that is Poop-Deck Cahill.
Looks like a prize-fighter, does nt he?
But the steward tells me he was educated
for the priesthood, and fell by the way-
side. That one close to the hatch, with
the red hair and hang-dog jib, is Seldom
Helward. He was shot off the crojack
yard. He fell into the lee clew of the
crojack, so we pulled him in.
	What did lie do, captain? asked
the grizzled skipper.
	Threw a marlinespike at the mate.
	Ought to ha killed him on the yard.
Are they all of a kind?
	Every man,  schooner sailors from
the lakes. Not one knew the ropes or
his place when we sailed. I ye set more
bones, mended more heads, and plugged
more shot-holes this voyage than ever
before, and my officers have grown per-
ceptibly thinner. But little by little,
man by man, we ye broken them in.
They re keeping a log, I learn; every
time a man gets thumped they enter
the tragedy and all sign their names.
They re going to law. Captain Ben-
son smiled dignifiedly at the outburst of
laughter evoked by this, and the men be-
low lifted their haggard, hopeless faces
an instant and looked at the party with
eyes that were furtive, catlike. They
could not hear, but knew that they were
being laughed at.
	They got a little law here, resumed
the captain. The consul put them all
in the calaboose for fear they d desert,
and they complained that they were half
starved when I took them out. To tell
the truth, they did nt throw any grub
overboard for a while. Nevertheless, a
good four weeks board-bill comes out of
their wages. I dont think they 11 have
much due them at New York. The na-
tives cleaned out the forecastle when they
were in jail, and they 11 have to draw
heavily oa my slop-chest.
	Captain, said another skipper of the
party, I d pay that crew off. You
ought to have let them run, or worked
them out and saved their pay. Look at
them,  look at the devils in their eyes.
I notice your mates seldom turn their
backs to them. Take my advice; get
rid of them.
	What? answered Captain Benson,
with a smile. Just when we have them
under control and useful? Oh no. I d
only have to ship a crowd of beach-comb-
ers and half-breeds at double pay. I ye
taken those sixteen hellyons round the
Horn, and I 11 take them back. I m
proud of theni. Just look at them, he
added vivaciously; docile and obedient,
 down on their knees with bibles in
their hands.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00218" SEQ="0218" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="212">	212	Where Angels Fear to Tread.
	And the name of the Lord on their
lips, grunted the adviser; but not in
prayer, I 11 bet you.
	Hardly, laughed Captain Benson.
Come below, gentlemen; dinner must
be ready.
	Dinner was not ready, but they seated
themselves at the cabin table, and while
waiting passed around a decanter of ap-
petizing yellow fluid, and drank to a
speedy and pleasant passage home for
the Almena and further confusion to her
misguided crew. Then they discussed
the depravity of sailors, until the stew-
ard, assisted by the Chinese cook, ap-
peared with the dinner. For lack of
facilities the mild-faced and smiling stew-
ard could not serve the dinner in the
style which it deserved. He would have
liked, he explained, to bring it on in
separate courses. But one and all dis-
claimed such frivolity. There was the
dinner, and that was enough. And it
was a splendid dinner; but, either be-
cause thirteen men had sat down to the
table, or because the fates were unusual-
ly freakish, it was destined that not one
man there should partake of it. On
deck things had been happening; and
just as the steward had placed the last
smoking dish on the table, a wet, be-
draggled, dirty little man, his clothing
splashed with the slime of the deck, his
eyes flaming green, his face expanded
to a smile of ferocity, appeared in the
forward doorway holding a cocked re-
volver which covered them all. Behind
him in the passage were other men,
equally unkempt, their eyes wide open
with excitement and anticipation.
	Dont you move, yelped the little
fellow,  not a man! Keep yer hands
out o yer pockets  put em over yer
heads  that s it  you too, capn.
	They obeyed him (there was death in
the green eyes and smile), all but one.
Captain Benson sprang to his feet with
a hand in his breast pocket.
	You scoundrels! he cried as he drew
forth a pistol. Leave this  The
speech was stopped by a report,  deaf-
ening in the closed-up space,  and Cap-
tain Benson fell heavily, his pistol rat-
tling on the floor.
	Shoot me off a yard, will ye?
growled another voice through the
smoke. In the after door were more
men, the red-haired Seldom Helward in
the van, holding a smoking pistol. Get
the gun, one o you! he called.
	A man stepped past and picked up the
captains pistol, which he cocked.
	One by one, said Seldom, his voice
rising to the pitch and timbre of a trum-
pet-blast, you men walk out of the f or-
rard companion with your hands over
your heads. Plug them, Sinful, if two
move together, and shoot to kill.
	Taken by surprise, the guests, resolute
men though they were, obeyed the com-
mand. As each rose to his feet, he was
first relieved of a bright revolver, which
served to increase the moral front of the
enemy, then led out to the booby-hatch,
on which lay a newly broached coil of
hambro-line and a pile of thole-pins from
the locker within. Here he was searched
again, for jack-knife or brass knuckles,
bound with the hambro-line, gagged with
a thole-pin, and marched forward past
the prostrate first officer, quiet and pale
in the slime, and the agonized second
officer, gagged and bound to the fife-rail
 to the port forecastle, where he was
locked in with the Chinese cook, who,
similarly treated, had preceded. The
mild-faced steward, weeping now, was
sternly questioned, and allowed his free-
dom on promising not to sing out or
make trouble. Captain Benson was ex-
amined, his injury was diagnosed as brain
concussion from the glancing bullet, more
or less serious, and he was dragged out
to the scuppers and bound beside his
unconscious first officer. Then, leaving
them to live or die as their subconscious-
ness determined, the sixteen mutineers
sacrilegiously re~ntered the cabin and de-
voured the dinner.
	When you have cursed, kicked, and</PB>

beaten a slave for five months, it is al-
ways advisable to watch him for a few
seconds after administering correction,
to give him time to realize his condition;
and when you have carried a revolver
in your right-hand trousers pocket for
five months, it is advisable occasionally
to inspect the cloth of the pocket, to make
sure that it is not wearing thin from the
chafe of the muzzle. Mr. Jackson had
ignored the first rule of conduct; Mr.
Becker, the second. Mr. Jackson had
kicked. Sinful Peck once too often; but
not knowing that it was once too often,
had immediately turned his back, and
received thereat the sharp corner of a
bible on his bump of inhabitiveness, 
which bump must have responded in its
function; for Mr. Jackson showed no
immediate desire to move from the place
where he fell. Mr. Becker, on his way
to the lazaret in the stern for a bucket
of sand to assist in the holystoning, had
reached the head of the poop steps when
this occurred, and, turning at the sound
of his superiors fall, bounded to the
main deck without touching the steps,
reaching for his pistol as he landed, only
to pinion his fingers in a large hole in
the pocket. Wildly he struggled to re-
claim his weapon, down his trousers leg,
but he could not reach it; his anxious
face betrayed his predicament to the
wakening men, and when he looked into
Mr. Jacksons pistol, held bySinful Peck,
he submitted to being bound to the fife-
rail and gagged with the end of the top-
gallant sheet, a large rope which filled
his mouth and hurt. Then the firearm
was recovered, and the descent upon the
dinner-party planned and carried out.
	Without the vocal expression of emo-
tion, the conduct of these men, after that
good dinner, was somewhat similar to
that of a kennel of hunting-dogs loosed
after confinement on a fine day. They
waltzed, boxed, wrestled, flung each oth-
er about the deck, threw handsprings
and cartwheels,  those not too weak, 
buffeted, kicked, and clubbed the suffer-
ing second mate, reviled and cursed the
unconscious captain and chief mate, and
when tired of this, as children and dogs
of play, they turned to their captives for
amusement. The second mate was taken
from the fife-rail, with hands still bound,
and led to the forecastle; the gags of
all and the bonds of the cook were re-
moved, and the forecastle dinner was
brought from the galley. This the pri-
soners were invited to eat. There was
a piece of salt beef, boiled a little longer
than usual on account of the delay. It
was black, brown, green, and iridescent
in spots; it was slippery with ptomaines,
filthy to the sight, stinking and nauseat-
ing. There were potatoes, a year old,
shriveled before boiling, hard and soggy,
black, blue, and bitter after the process.
And there was the usual weevily hard-
tack in the bread-barge.
	Protest was useless. The unhappy
captives surrounded that dinner, and,
with hands behind their backs and dis-
gust in their faces, masticated and swal-
lowed the morsels which the Chinese
cook put to their mouths, while their
feelings were further outraged by the
hilarity of the men at their backs, and
their appetites occasionally jogged into
activity by the impact on their heads of
a tarry fist or pistol-butt. At last a port-
ly captain began vomiting, and this be-
ing contagious the meal ended; for even
the stomachs of the sailors were affected.
	There were cool heads among that
crowd of mutineers,  men who thought
of consequences: Poop - Deck Cahill,
square-faced and resolute, but thoughtful
of eye and refined of speech; Seldom
Helward,  who had shot the captain,
 a man whose fiery hair, arching eye-
brows, Roman nose, and explosive lan-
guage indicated the daredevil, but whose
intelligent though humorous eye gave
certain signs of repressive study and
thought; and Bigpig Monahan, already
described. These three men went into
executive session under the break of
the poop, to the conclusion that the con-</PB>

sul who had jailed them for nothing
would probably hang them for this;
and, calling the rest to the conference
as a committee of the whole, they out-
lined and put to vote a proposition to
make sail and go to sea, leaving the fate
of their captives for later consideration,
 which was adopted unanimously and
with much profanity, the central thought
of the latter being an intention to
make em finish the holystoning for
the fun they had laughing at us. Then
Bigpig Monahan sneaked below and in-
duced the steward to toss through the
storeroom deadlight every bottle of wine
and liquor which the ship carried.
	Six second mates on six American
ships watched doubtingly as sails were
dropped and yards mastheaded on board
the Almena, and at last sent six din-
geys, which could only muster around
the mooring-buoy, where a wastefully
slipped shot of anchor-chain told that
all was not right. But by the time the
matter was reported ashore, the Al-
mena, having caught the newly arrived
southerly wind of the coast, was hull
down at sea.
	Four days later, one of her boats, con-
taining twelve sore-headed nien, with
faces disfigured and clothing ruined 
particularly about the knees of the trou-
sers  by oily wood pulp, came wearily
into the roadstead from the open sea,
past the shipping and up to the landing
at the custom-house docks. From here
the twelve went to the American Con-
sulate and entered bitter complaint of
inhuman treatment at the hands of six-
teen mutinous sailors on board the Al-
mena,  treatment so cruel that they
had welcomed being turned adrift in an
open boat; whereat the consul, deplor-
ing the absence of man-of-war or steamer
to send in pursuit, took their individual
affidavits; and these he sent to San
Francisco, from which point the account
of the crime  described as piracy 
spread to every newspaper in Christen-
dom.
III.

	A northeast gale off Hatteras: im-
mense gray combers, five to the mile,
charging shoreward, occasionally break-
ing, again lifting their heads too high
in the effort, truncated as by a knife,
and the liquid apex shattered to spray;
an expanse of leaden sky showing be-
tween the rain-squalls, across which dull
background rushed the darker scud
and storm-clouds; a passenger steamer
rolling helplessly in the trough, and a
square-rigged vessel, hove to on the port
tack, two miles to windward of the
steamer and drifting south toward the
storm-centre. This is the picture that
the sea-birds saw at daybreak on a Sep-
tember morning; and could the sea-
birds have spoken, they might have told
that the square-rigged craft carried a
navigator who had learned that a whirl-
ing fury of storm-centre was less to be
feared than the deadly Diamond Shoals
 the outlying guard of Cape Hatteras
 toward which that steamer was drift-
ing, broadside on.
	Square-faced and thoughtful of eye,
clad in yellow oilskins and souwester,
he stood by the after companionway, in-
tently examining through a pair of
glasses the wallowing steamer to lee-
ward, barely distinguishable in the half-
light and driving spindrift. At the
wheel stood a little man, who sheltered
a cheerful face under the lee of a big
coat collar and occasionally peeped out
at the navigator.
	What d ye make of him, Poop-
Deck? he asked.
	He s in trouble, Sinful; there goes
his ensign  American  union down.
	From a flag-locker within the com-
panionway Poop-Deck drew out the stars
and stripes, which he ran up to the mon-
key-gaff. Then he looked again.
	Down goes his ensign  up goes
the code pennant. He wants to signal.
Come up here, boys! he shouted.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00221" SEQ="0221" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="215">	Where Angels Fear to Tread.	215

	As six men who had been pacing the
main deck climbed the poop ladder, he
bent on the corresponding code signal to
the other part of the halyards and ran
it up, while the ensign fluttered down.
Go down, one of you, he said, and
get the signal - book and shipping - list.
He 11 show his number next. Get ours
ready,  H. L. F. T.
	One of the sailors sprang below for the
books named, the others hooked together
the flags forming the ships number, and
Poop-Deck resumed the glasses.
	Q. T. F. N.! he exclaimed. Look
it up.
	The books had arrived, and while one
man lowered and hoisted again the code
signal  which was also the answering
pennant  the others pored over the
shipping-list.
	Steamer Aldebaran, of New York,
they said.
	The pennant came down, and the ships
number went up to the gaff.
	H. V.! called Poop-Deck, as he
scanned two flags now flying from the
steamers truck. What does that
2
say.
	Damaged rudder  cannot steer,
they answered.
	Pull down the number and show the
answering pennant. Let s see that sig-
nal-book. Poop-Deck turned the leaves,
studied a page for a moment, then said,
Run up H. V. R. That says, What
do you want? and it s the nearest thing
to it.
	These flags took the place of the pen-
nant, and Poop-Deck again watched;
noting first the steamers answering sig-
nal, then the letters K. R. N.
	What does K. R. N. say? he asked.
	They turned the leaves, and answered,
I can tow you.
	Tow us! exclaimed three or four
together. We re all right. We dont
want a tow. How can he tow us when
he cant steer?
	He wants to tow us so that he can
steer, you blasted fools, said Poop-
Deck. He can go where he likes with
a big drag on his stern.
	~~rrhat s so. Where s he bound?
	Did nt say; but he 11 fetch up on
the shoals soon, if we dont help.
	Towline s down the fore-peak, said
one.  Could nt get it up in an hour,
remarked another. Yes, we can, re-
joined a third. Then, all speaking at
once, and each raising his voice to its
limit, they argued excitedly: Cant be
done  Coil it on the forecastle  Yes,
we can  Too much sea  Run down to
windward  Line ud part, anyhow 
Float a barrel  Shut up  I tell you
we can  Call the watch  Seldom, yer
daft  Need nt get a boat over  Hell
ye can  Call the boys  All hands with
heavin-lines  Cant back a topsail in
this  Go lay down  Soak yer head,
Seldom  Hush  Dry up  Nothin
you cant do  Go to hell  I tell you,
by God, we can  Do as I say, and
we 11 get a line to him or get his.
	The affirmative speaker, who had also
uttered the last declaration, was Seldom
Helward. Put me in command! he
yelled excitedly. Do what I tell you
and we 11 make fast to him!
	No captains here, growled one,
while the rest eyed Seldom reprovingly.
	Well, there ought to be. You re
all rattled, and dont know any more
than to let thousands o dollars in sal-
vage slip by you.
	Salvage?
	Yes, salvage. Big boat  full o pas-
sengers and valuable cargo  shoals to
looward of him  cant steer. You
poor fools, what ails you?
	Foller Seldom!  vociferated the lit-
tle man at the wheel. Foller Seldom
and ye 11 wear stripes!
	Shut up, Sinful. Strike the bell.
Call the watch,  it s near seven bells.
	The uproarious howl with which sail-
ors call the watch below was delivered
down the cabin stairs, and soon eight
other men came up, grumbling at the
premature wakening, while two more</PB>

came out of the forecastle and joined
one who, during the signaling, had re-
mained forward. Seldom Helwards
proposition was discussed noisily in joint
session on the poop, and finally accepted.
	We put you in charge, Seldom,
said Bigpig Monahan sternly, against
the rule, cause we think you ye got
some good scheme in your head. But
if you have nt,  if you make a mess
of things just to have a little fun boss-
in us,  you 11 hear from us. Go
ahead, now, you re capn.
	Seldom climbed to the top of the af-
ter house, looked to windward, then to
leeward at the rolling steamer, and
called out, I want more beef at the
wheel. Bigpig, take it; and you, Tur-
key, stand by with him. Get away from
there, Sinful. Give her the upper main-
topsail; the rest of you, and Poop-Deck,
you stand by the signal halyards. Ask
him if he s got a towline ready.
	Protesting angrily at the slight put
upon him, Sinful Peck relinquished the
wheel and accompanied the others to
the main deck. Two men went aloft to
loose the topsail, while Poop-Deck exam-
ined the signal-book.
	K. S. G. says, Have a towline
ready. That ought to do, he said.
	Run it up, ordered the newly in-
stalled captain, and watch his answer.
	Up ~vent the signal, and as the men
on the main deck were manning the top-
sail halyards Poop-Deck made out the
answer,  V. K. C.
	That means, All right, Seldom,
he said, after examining the book.
	Good enough; hut we 11 get our
line ready, too. Get down and help em
masthead the yard; then take em for-
rard and coil the towline abaft the
windlass. Get out all the heavin-lines,
too:
	Poop-Deck obeyed, and while the
main-topsail yard slowly arose to place
Seldom himself ran up the answering
pennant, and then a repetition of the
steamers last message, All right.
This was the final signal displayed. It
was lowered, and for a half-hour Seldom
waited until the others had lifted a nine-
inch hawser from the fore-peak and coiled
it down. Then came his next orders in
a continuous roar 
Three hands aft to the spanker sheet
 stand by to slack off and haul in.
Man braces for wearing ship, the rest o
you. Hard up the wheel. Check in
starboard main and crojack braces.
Shiver the topsail. Slack off that
spanker.
	His orders were obeyed. The ship
paid off, staggered a little in the trough
under the right - angle pressure of the
gale, swung still farther, and steadied
down to a long, rolling motion, dead be-
fore the wind, heading for the stern of
the steamer. Yards were squared in,
the spanker hauled aft, staysail trimmed
to port, and all hands waited while the
ship charged down the two miles of
distance. Handles like a yacht, mut-
tered Seldom, as, with brow wrinkled and
keen eye flashing above his hooked nose,
he conned the steering from his place
near the mizzenmast.
	Three men separated themselves from
the rest and came aft. One was tall,
broad - shouldered, and smooth - shaven,
with a palpable limp; another, short,
broad, and hairy, showed a lamentable
absence of front teeth; and the third, a
blue-eyed man, slight and graceful of
movement, carried his arm in splints and
sling.
	I wish to protest, said this man as
they climbed the poop steps. I am
captain here under the law. I protest
against this insanity. No boat can live
in such a sea. No help can be given
that steamer.
	I bear witness to the protest, said
the tall man.
	The short, hairy man might also have
spoken, but had no time.
	Get off the poop! yelled Seldom.
Go forrard where you belong! He
stood close to the bucket-rack around the</PB>

skylight. Seizing bucket after bucket,
he launched them at his visitors, with
the result that the big man was tumbled
down the poop steps head first, while
the other two followed, right side up,
but hurriedly, and bearing some sore
spots. Then the rest of the men set
upon them, much as a pack of dogs
might worry strange cats, and kicked
and buffeted them forward.
	There was not much time for amuse-
ment of this sort. Yards were braced
-	to port, for the ship was careering down
toward the steamer at a ten-knot rate.
Soon black dots on her rail resolved into
passengers waving hats and handker-
chiefs, and black dots on the boat-deck
into sailors standing by the end of a haw-
ser which led up from the bitts below on
the fantail. The ship came down until
it might have seemed that Seldoms in-
tention was to ram the steamer. But
not so; when a scant two lengths sepa-
rated the two craft, he called out, Hard
down! Light up the staysail sheet and
stand by the fore braces!
	Around came the ship on the crest
of a sea, sank into the hollow behind,
shipped a few dozen tons of water from
the next comber, and lay fairly steady
with her bows meeting the seas and the
huge steamer not a half-length away on
the lee quarter. The fore topmast stay-
sail was flattened, and Seldom closely
scrutinized the drift and heave of the
ship.
	How s your wheel, Bigpig? he
asked.
	Hard down.
	Put it up a little; keep her ia the
trough.
	He noted the effect on the ship of this
change; then, as though satisfied, roared
out, Let your fore braces hang forrard
there! Stand by heavin-lincs fore and
aft! Stand by to go ahead on that steam-
er when we have your line! The last
injunction, delivered through his hands,
went down the wind like a thunder-clap,
and the officers on the steamers bridge,
vainly trying to make themselves heard
against the gale, started perceptibly at
tIme impact of sound, and one of them
went to the engine-room speaking-tube.
	Breast to breast the two vessels lifted
and fell. At certain moments, it seemed
that the ship was to be dropped bodily on
the deck of the steamer; at others, her
crew looked up a hundred-foot slope to
where the other craft was poised at the
crest. Then the steamer would drop, and
the next sea would heave the ship toward
her. But it was noticeable that every
bound brought the ship nearer, and also
farther ahead; for the sails were doing
their work.
	Kick ahead on board the steamer!
thundered Seldom from his eminence.
Go ahead! Start the wagon  or say
your prayers, you blasted idiots!
	The engines were already turning.
But it takes time to overcome three thou-
sand tons of inertia, and before the
steamer had forged ahead six feet the
ship had lifted high above her and de-
scended her black side with a grinding
crash of wood against iron. Fore and
main channels on the ship were carried
away, leaving all lee rigging slack and
useless; lower braces caught in the steam-
ers davit cleats and snapped; but the
sails, held by the weather braces, re-
mained full, and the yards did not swing.
The two craft separated with a roll, and
came together again with more scraping
and snapping of rigging. Passengers
left the rail, dived indoors, and took
refuge on the opposite side, where fall-
ing blocks and spars might not reach
them. Another leap toward the steamer
resulted in the ships main topgallant-
mast falling in a zigzag whirl, as the
snapping gear aloft impeded it, and,
dropping athwart the steamers funnel,
neatly sent the royal yard with sail at-
tached down the iron cylinder, where it
soon blazed and assisted the artificial
draft in the stoke - hold. Next came
the fore topgallantmast, which smashed
a couple of boats; then, as the round</PB>

black stern of the steamer scraped the
lee bow of the ship, jib-guys parted and
the jib-boom itself went, snapping at the
bowsprit-cap, with the last bite the ship
made at the steamer she was helping.
But all through this riot of destruction
 while passengers screamed and prayed,
while officers shouted and swore on the
steamer, and Seldom Helward, bellow-
ing insanely, danced up and down on
the ships house, and the hail of wood
and iron from aloft threatened their
heads  men were passing the towline.
	It was a seven-inch steel hawser with
a manila tail, which they had taken to
the fore topsail sheet bitts before the
jib-boom had gone. Panting from their
exertions, they watched it lift from the
water as the steamer ahead paid out
with a taut strain; then, though the
crippled spars were in danger of falling
and really needed their first attention,
they ignored the fact and hurried aft as
one man to attend to Seldom.
	Encouraged by the objurgations of
Bigpig and his assistant, who were steer-
ing now after the steamer, they called
their late commander down from the
house and deposed him in a concert of
profane ridicule and abuse, to which he
replied in kind. He was str~ick in the
face by the small fist of Sinful Peck,
and immediately knocked the little man
down. Then he was knocked down him-
self by a larger fist, and, fighting bravely
and viciously, became the object of fist-
blows and kicks, until, in one of his whirl-
ing staggers along the deck, he passed
close to a short, broad, hairy man, who,
yielding to the excitement of the moment,
added a blow to Seldoms punishment.
It was an unfortunate mistake; for he
took Seldoms place, and the rain of fists
and boots descended on him until he fell
unconscious. Mr. Helward himself de-
livered the last quieting blow, and then
stood over him with a lurid grin on his
bleeding face.
	Got to put down mutiny though the
heavens fall, he said painfully.
	Right you are, Seldom, answered
one. Here, Jackson, Benson, drag him
forrard; and, Seldom, he added re-
provingly, dont you ever try it again.
Want to be captain, hey? You cant;
you dont know enough. You could nt
command my wheelbarrow. Here s
three days work to clear up the muss
you ye made.
	But in this he spoke more, and less,
than the truth. The steamer, going slow-
ly and steering with a bridle from the
towline to each quarter, kept the ships
canvas full until her crew had steadied
the yards and furled it. Then, an un-
canny appearance of the sea to leeward
and a blackening of the sky to windward
indicated a too close proximity to the
shoals, and probable increase of wind
and sea. The steamer waited no longer.
With a preliminary blast of her whistle,
she hung the weight of the ship on the
starboard bridle, gave power to her en-
gines, and rounded to, very slowly, head
to sea, while the men on the ship, who
had been carrying the end of their haw-
ser up the fore topmast rigging, dropped
it and came down hurriedly.
	Released from the wind pressure on
her strong side, which had somewhat
steadied her, the ship now rolled more
than she had done in the trough; and
with every starboard roll were ominous
creakings and grindings aloft. At last
came a heavier lurch, and both crippled
topmasts fell, taking with them the miz-
zen topgallantmast. Luckily, no one was
hurt, and the men disgustedly cut the
wreck adrift, stayed the fore and main
masts with the hawser, and, resigning
themselves to a large subtraction from
their salvage, went to a late breakfast,
 a savory meal of fried ham and pota-
toes, hot cakes and coffee, served to six-
teen in the cabin, and an unsavory mess
of hard-tack hash, with an infusion of
burnt bread-crust, peas, beans, and lea-
ther, handed, but not served, to three in
the forecastle.
	Three days later, with Sandy Hook</PB>

lighthouse showing through the haze
ahead, and nothing left of the gale but a
rolling ground-swell, the steamer slowed
down, so that a pilot boats dingey could
put a man aboard each craft; and the
one who climbed the ships side was the
pilot who had taken her to sea, outward
bound, and sympathized with her crew.
They surrounded him on the poop and
asked for news, while the three men for-
ward looked aft hungrily, as though they
would have joined the meeting, but dared
not. Instead of giving news the pilot
asked questions, which the men answered.
	I knew you d taken charge, boys,
he said at last; the whole world knows
it, and every man-of-war on the Pacific
stations is looking for you. But they re
looking out there. What brings you
round here, dismasted, towing into New
York?
	That s where the ship s bound, New
York. We took her out; we bring her
home. We dont want her; dont be-
long to us. We re law-abidin men.
	Law - abiding men? asked the
amazed pilot.
	You bet. We re goin to prosecute
those dogs of ours forrard to the last limit
of the law. We 11 show em they cant
starve and hammer and shoot American
citizens just cause they ye got guns in
their pockets.
	The pilot looked forward, answered a
nod, and asked, Who s captain?
	Nobody! they roared. Had
enough o captains  This ship s an un-
limited democracy  Everybody s just
as good as the next man  All but the
dogs; they sleep on the bunk-boards, do
as they re told, and eat salt mule and
dunderfunk, same as we did goin out.
	Did they navigate for you? Did no
one have charge of things?
	Poop-Deck, here, picked up naviga-
tion, and we let him off steerin and
standin lookout. Then Seldom wanted
to be captain just once, and we let him
 well, look at our spars.
	The pilot looked. Then the men ex
plained the meeting with the steamer and
Seldoms misdoing, and requested infor-
mation about the salvage laws.
	Boys, said the pilot, I m sorry
for you. I saw the start of this voyage,
and you appear to be decent men. You 11
get no salvage; you 11 get no wages.
You are mutineers and pirates, with no
standing in court. Any salvage which
the Almena has earned will go to her
owners, and to the three men whom you
deprived of command. What you can
get  the maximum, though I cant say
how hard the judge will lay it on  is
ten years in states prison and a fine of
two thousand dollars each. We 11 have
to stop at quarantine. Take my advice:
if you get a chance, lower a boat and
skip.
	They laughed at the advice. They
had only repressed inhuman brutality.
	An hour later the pilot pointed to the
Almenas number flying from the steam-
ers truck. He s telling on you, boys,
he said. He knew you when you helped
him, and used you, of course. Your re-
putation is international and bad. See
that signal-station ashore there? You 11
find a police boat at quarantine.
	He was but partly right. Not only a
police boat, but an outward-bound man-
of-war and an incoming revenue cutter
escorted the ship to quarantine, where
the towline was cast off and an anchor
dropped. Then, in the persons of a
scandalized health officer, a naval cap-
tain, a revenue marine lieutenant, and a
purple-faced sergeant of the steamboat
squad, the power of the law was reha-
bilitated on the Almenas quarter deck,
and the strong hand of the law closed
down on her unruly crew. With blank
faces, they discarded, to shirts, trousers,
and boots, the slop-chest clothing which
belonged to the triumphant Captain Ben-
son, and descended the side to the police
boat, which immediately steamed away.
Then a chuckling trio entered the ships
cabin and ordered the steward to bring
them something to eat.</PB>

	Now, there is no record, either in the
reports for that year of the police de-
partment, or from any official babbling,
or from later yarns spun by the sixteen
prisoners, of what really occurred on the
deck of that steamer while she was go-
ing up the bay. Newspapers of the time
gave generous space to speculations writ-
ten up on the facts discovered by re-
porters; but nothing was ever proven.
The facts were few. A tug met the
steamer in the Narrows about a quarter
to twelve that morning, and her captain,
on being questioned, declared that all
seemed well with her. The prisoners
were grouped forward, guarded by eight
officers and a sergeant. A little after
twelve, a Battery boatman observed her
coming, and hied him around to the po-
lice dock to have a look at the murder-
ous pirates he had heard about, only to
see her heading up the North River, past
the Battery. A watchman on the eleva-
tor docks at Sixty-Third Street observed
her charging up the river a little later in
the afternoon, wondered why, and spoke
of it. The captain of the Mary Powel,
bound up, reported catching her abreast
of Yonkers. He had whistled as he
passed, and, though no one was in sight,
the salute was politely answered. At
some time during the night, residents of
Sing Sing were wakened by a sound of
steam blowing off somewhere on the
river; and in the morning, a couple of
fishermen, going out to their pond-nets
in the early dawn, found the police boat
grounded on the shoals. On boarding
her they had released a pinioned, gagged,
and hungry captain in the pilot - house,
and an engineer, a fireman, and two deck
hands, similarly limited, in the lamp-
room. They pried open the nailed doors
of the dining-room staircase, and liber-
ated a purple-faced sergeant and eight
furious policemen, who chased their de-
liverers into their skiff, and spoke sternly
to the working force.
	Among the theories advanced was one
by the editor of a paper in a small Lake
Ontario town, to the effect that it made
little difference to a lake sailor whether
he shipped as captain, mate, engineer,
sailor, or fireman, and that the officers
of the New York Harbor Patrol had
only underestimated the calibre of the
men in their charge, leaving them un-
guarded while they went to dinner. But
his paper and town were small and far
away, he could not possibly know any-
thing of the subject, and his opinion ob-
tained little credence.
	Years later, he attended as guest a
meeting and dinner of the Shipmasters
and Pilots Association of Cleveland,
Ohio, when a resolution was adopted to
petition the city for a harbor police ser-
vice. Captain Monahan, Captain Hel-
ward, Captain Peck, and Captain Cahill,
having spoken and voted in the negative,
left their seats on the adoption of the
proposition, reached a clear spot on the
floor, shook hands silently, and then,
forming a ring, danced around in a cir-
cle, the tails of their coats standing out
in horizontal rigidity, until reproved by
the chair.
	And the editor knew why.

DRIFTWOOD.

	THE storm was over. Dawn came
with a clear sky and no wind. Though
a white-streaked, leaping sea still dashed
and thundered upon the encircling reef,
the water inside was flat and noiseless
save for a gentle plashing at its edge.
When, with tropic haste, the sun rose and
proclaimed the day, the ocean seemed to
have forgotten its anger. Beyond the
boiling reef it had become a merry dan-
cing sea of sapphires and diamonds, deep
blue and sparkling white; inside the bar-
rier it lay a placid zone of cobalt, which
gradually turned to green as it neared
the shore and the yellow sand showed
through it. But on the island the palms
were bent and tattered; the foliage of
the undergrowth was shriveled and black-
9

ened as by a frost; and all along the
strand there ran a dark, irregular line of
sea-wreck.
	A few yards above high-water mark,
face downward at the foot of a giant
palm, lay a man. One arm rested un-
der his forehead; the other was stretched
out before him. Upon the latter a full-
rigged ship had been tattooed. His head
and feet were bare, and his torn clothes
were still wet.
	The sun climbed, the heat increased,
the frightened birds in the thickets took
courage and began to call again, but the
man did not move; for he was spent by
his struggle with the sea.
	Later, a gaudy lowrie shrieking over-
head roused him, and he sat up, staring
about him with wild, frightened eyes.
Then, slowly, painfully, he rose, and limp-
ing down to the water, he stood, sway-
ing unsteadily, with one hand shading
his weak eyes, and looked anxiously sea-
ward.
	Now that the tide was out, he could see
the swart, jagged crest of the reef upon
which the ship had struck. A flock of
sea-birds circled and screamed above it
in one place, but except the birds, the
rocks, and the sea there was nothing.
	The man sat down heavily, and cov-
ered his face with his hands. Again he
lifted his head, and gazed sightlessly at
the far - away horizon. After a little
while a wandering crab caught his at-
tention. He watched it stupidly for a
moment; then suddenly pounced upon it,
pulled off its claws, and carried it above
the tide-mark. Now that the instinct of
self-preservation was stirred in him, he
began to search for food. Instead of
striking into the forest, as a landsman
would have done, he clung tenaciously
to the one thing he knew and called his
friend,  the sea. The tangled under-
brush, the shadowy glades, the mysteri-
ous noises of the forest, all caused him
apprehension; but on the shore, with the
sound of the ocean in his ears and the
invigorating smell of seaweed in his nos-
trils, he felt more confidence.
	Some rock-oysters, chipped laborious-
ly from the stones uncovered by the tide,
appeased his hunger. Water he found
in the hollows of the higher rocks.
Though the salt spray had mingled with
the rain and made it brackish, it con-
tented him.
	Strengthened and encouraged by his
meal, he washed the sand from his black
hair and beard, cleansed his torn hands
and feet, and, manlike, began to plan.
He would see what material he had at
hand, what wreckage had been washed
up, and would search for his shipmates
who had taken to the boats. It could not
be possible that he alone out of all the
ships company had reached the island,
 he who had been the last to leave the
ship. No, surely he was not alone!
Cheered by this new thought, he started
hopefully along the beach, turning to
the right, with a sailors way of doing
things with the sun.</PB></P>

	THE storm was over. Dawn came
with a clear sky and no wind. Though
a white-streaked, leaping sea still dashed
and thundered upon the encircling reef,
the water inside was flat and noiseless
save for a gentle plashing at its edge.

	The masses of fresh kelp which
marked the limit of the seas late flood
were mixed with sponge growths, coral,
poiyps, shells, sea-fans, and dead fish.
The shore was littered with strange things
wrenched from the ocean - bed. Some-
times the man stopped and looked at
these things curiously, and once he put
a lustrous cowrie in his pocket.
	As he walked on and on, however,
such objects ceased to interest him; for
he was seeking wreckage and his fellow
men, and he found neither. At every
point that cut off his view he would say,
I shall see them when I round that,
and he would put forth all his strength
to reach it; but each time he stood at
the turn and opened a new prospect, dis-
appointment awaited him.
	The day wore on, and he became very
weary. His limping gait grew slower
and slower. His head dropped on his
chest. A wide bay, without a cheering
sign, had to be skirted before he could
reach the next cape; and he felt that he
could not go much farther.
	Presently, a long white object lay at
his feet, and with a cry of joy he opened
his half-shut eyes. It was an oar. He
looked eagerly round for the boat to
which it belonged; but no boat was to be
seen, neither was there a footprint nor
any trace that one had landed there.
	Capsized! he muttered despondent-
ly, and shouldering the oar he limped on.
	He had gone but a short distance, how-
ever, when he stopped again. This time
it was before a fancy ships bucket.
The wood was white, the hoops were
blue, and the rope handle was an elabo-
rate piece of sailor handiwork. As he
turned it over thoughtfully with his foot,
he started; for he saw that the name
painted upon it was not the name of his
ship, but that of another vessel. Then
he dropped the oar, and found that it
too was branded with the strange name.
	D-r-u-i-d, Druid, lie said. My
God! Then there were two wrecks!
After a pause he continued: And only
one man saved! Ha! ha! ha! What
a joke! Ha! ha!  and he broke into
shouts of hoarse laughter.
	Suddenly his unnatural merriment end-
ed; for far down the beach, near to the
waters edge, there was a dark something
that moved. Though at the moment it
was still, the man could have sworn that
he had seen it stir, and was instantly filled
with a vague fear. Rigid and breath-
less, lie stood and watched the thing. It
moved again. Then, cautiously, with min-
gled feelings of curiosity, fear, and hope,
the man approached it. At one moment
it looked like a roll of seaweed, at an-
other a seal, and at yet another a human
body. As he got nearer, he saw that a
rocking motion was given to the thing by
an occasional wave that ran up higher
than its fellows, and that the thing itself
was a woman.
	Forgetting his weariness and pain, the
man ran; then stopped, looking down
with dismay at the piteous heap before
him. The woman lay on her side in a
little bed which the weight of her body
and the incoming waves had made in the
sand; her face and hands were pallid,
her lips were set, and her long brown hair
was spread upon the beach like a deli-
cate seaweed. About her waist two life-
belts had been securely lashed, and from
her neck there hung by a silken string a
small chamois bag.
	As the man bent over her he was
filled with pity, and tears rolled down his
cheeks,  tears that were partly for her,
and partly for his lonely self. Why, oh
why, had she not lived? He touched her
cold hands and face, placed his ear to her
mouth, but could detect no life. On a
sudden a new hope sprang within him,
and, growing strong with it, he lifted the
woman in his arms and staggered up
the beach, where he laid her down in the
warm sand, out of the reach of the sea.
	Quickly loosing the life - belts from
about her waist, he found to his delight
that she was still warm. Though she
was apparently drowned, life was not ex</PB>

tinct, and, with a sailors knowledge, he
began at once to practice the methods
used to produce artificial breathing. He
worked with grim, deliberate persever-
ance, until she breathed naturally; then
he restored warmth and circulation by
stones which had lain in the sun and by
rubbing. At last the woman opened her
large blue eyes, and gazed wonderingly
into the mans eager face. Then she
closed them again and fell asleep. With
a great joy in his heart the man rose,
and went away to collect shellfish; for
he knew now that the woman would not
die.
	After the castaways had lived upon
rock-oysters and cocoanuts for two days
the man made a fire-drill, and by dint
of much labor produced fire, which he
kept burning day and night. With a
sharp stone he hewed out a rude spear
for spearing fish, and a throwing-stick to
kill the many tame birds that flew about
the island. Turtle eggs he found in a
cove near by, and in the forest an abun-
dance of yams and plantains. When
there was no longer any need of being
anxious about food, he built the woman
a little hut of boughs, so that she might
be sheltered from the heavy rains and
be alone.
	The woman, however, grieved exceed-
ingly, and would not be comforted. All
day she sat in the shadow of the palms,
staring at the sea. Though she tried to
be brave before the man, he would often
return from hunting or fishing to find
her weeping bitterly.
	Fearful that she would go mad or die,
he tried to distract her by seeking her
advice and help. He taught her to twist
cocoa fibre into strings and ropes, to
make a net from the same material; he
stripped the life- belts of their canvas
coverings, and asked her to make him a
coat; he took her with him to the cove
for turtle eggs and to the forest for fruit,
making pretense always that he needed
her assistance. And ever he spoke in
strong, hopeful words of the future.
Some day, he told her, a ship would
come and carry them away from their
island prison. So cheery, so full of faith
was he that she came to believe him;
whereupon her grief abated and her cour-
age came back.
	One day he came to her and said, On
the other side of the island I have found
a better place to live than this. There
is plenty of good water and fruit, and a
high cliff from which to keep a lookout;
and a signal - fire lighted on the cliff
could be seen for thirty miles. Shall
we go?
	The womans eyes brightened, and she
said,  Yes ! yes ! Let us go at once.
	When they reached the new place, and
the woman saw the cliff, the crystal riv-
ulet that went singing across the yellow
sand to the sea, and the wealth of gay,
perfume - laden flowers that decked the
slope, she cried, Oh, how beautiful!
For the first time since she had been
upon the island she smiled.
	As soon as they were settled in their
new camp the man began to build a
huge bonfire on the bald summit of the
cliff. As all the wood had to be carried
from below, and as he had neither axe
nor knife to aid him, the task was a long
and hard one. He laid alternate layers
of dry wood and green branches, so that
the fire, when lighted, should send up a
column of black smoke. It took him
three weeks to raise the pile to the size
he wanted, and during this time the wo-
man helped him bundle the wood and
cooked their simple meals.
	When the great work was finished and
ready for the torch, they went up and
looked at it admiringly, and both were
filled with eager hopefulness. They felt
now that they were ready for the ship;
that when she caine they should be seen
and saved.
	Each morning and evening they climbed
to their lookout, the man carrying a large
bundle of sticks, the woman a small one;
for it pleased them to increase the size of
their beacon. Panting they would reach</PB>

the top, and, dropping their burdens,
seat themselves in the cool breeze of the
height, to scan the horizon and anticipate
the coming of the ship. Sometimes they
speculated upon her,  wondered from
which direction she would come, whether
she would be a steamer or a sailing ves-
sel, and whither she would take them.
The ship, indeed, was the one theme of
their conversation, their one and only
hope, their future.
	Time went on, the weeks grew to
months, but no vessel appeared. Such
was their faith, however, that they did
not cease to believe, nor stop adding fuel
to their great unlighted beacon. In this
common work and faith, in spite of daily
disappointment, they drew closer togeth-
er, and were strangely content. Plain
food, physical labor, and an open-air life
brought the color back to the womans
cheeks, gave health and vigor to both
man and woman. Laughter came to
their lips easily, gladness to their eyes
they sang as they worked, went hand in
hand through the forest plucking flowers,
and, as though by magic, became chil-
dren again.
	They deceived themselves into think-
ing that these things were born of sym-
pathy and their mutual interest. Yet,
notwithstanding this, there was one sub-
ject which they guiltily avoided,  the
past. In the beginning the past had been
their chief topic, but as the months went
by they tacitly agreed to bury it.
	The man, being an ingenious, handy
fellow, made tools out of the iron hoops
of the bucket he had found, and with
them manufactured many things that
they needed. Before the rainy season
set in he built a stone house for the wo-
man, which he made waterproof with a
thatch of reeds; and for himself he hol-
lowed out a little cave at the foot of the
cliff. As soon as these things were ac-
complished he set to work making a bark
canoe, for he wished to search the bar-
rier reef for wreckage.
	In everything they did, however, nei
ther the man nor the woman forgot that
their work was but a makeshift,  that it
was merely to tide them over until they
were rescued. Nor did they cease to
climb the cliff morning and evening, nor
to add continually to their monster sig-
nal, nor to plan for the coming of the
ship.
	And in all they undertook, all their
plans and anticipations, they found a
happiness which constantly brought them
nearer and nearer together.
	By the calendar which the man had
scratched upon the smooth surface of a
rock, the castaways had been imprisoned
by the sea nearly five months before the
awakening came. Then, one day, while
he was gathering fruit, he looked out over
the ocean and saw a great white vessel
standing close in to the island. There-
upon he ran down quickly to the beach
where the woman was, crying joyously,
The ship! The ship!
	When she saw it she laughed and cried
by turns. For a moment they stood hold-
ing each others hands very tightly, and
looking rapturously at this the realization
of their one hope.
	Their ship had come at last!
	Then the man plucked a burning brand
from the camp-fire, and ran with all his
speed up the winding pathway they had
worn to the beacon. On the way he
snatched a handful of dry grass, with
which to kindle the blaze. Excited,
breathless, and flushed, he impatiently
shook himself clear of the view-destroy-
ing underbrush, and reached the hilltop.
The vessel was then almost abreast of the
cliff, and so near that he could look down
and see people upon her deck.
	Realizing that no time was to be lost,
the man knelt hurriedly at the foot of
the bonfire, thrust the dry grass beneath
a mass of small dead wood, and began
to blow the smoking flrebrand into life.
At the third puff, however, he stopped;
his hands fell limply at his sides; his
face became contorted, and he shrank
back from the pile, shuddering. For at</PB>

that moment there came to him know-
ledge, and with it fear. He knew then
that he loved the woman, and he knew
that the lighting of the fire meant separa-
tion. Fearfully he laid the brand down;
then rose and edged away from it as
though it were a snake.
	I will not! I will not! he mut-
tered fiercely. I will tell her the brand
went out.
	After a brief struggle, however, the
mans better nature asserted itself, and
he came back. With a trembling hand
he again lifted the fire-stick. Once more
the charcoal glowed; once more he was
on the point of sending aloft the signal.
But as he hesitated he heard quick steps
behind him, and a sound,  half cry, half
sob. He turned, and saw that it was the
woman.

looked into each others eyes they under-
stood all. With a smile upon her love.
illumined face, the woman lifted th~ fire-
brand and threw it into the sea beneath
them. Then the man opened his arms,
and the woman came to them.
	And there at the edge of the cliff, with
their signal-fire behind them, these two,
who had drifted so strangely together,
stood and watched the ship sail away.
A thin haze rolling up from the south-
ward soon enveloped the vessel. She be-
came a phantom shape, then a thin dark
line, which grew fainter and fainter, and

THE TINKLING SIMLINS.

	IT was admitted that there was no
other man around North Pass who could
get together so good a force of berry-
pickers as Abe Tweedy,  or Twiddy,
as he was known by word of mouth. He
went out into the wilds of Johnson Coun-
ty to engage them in April; imported
them to the Floyd farm, near the pass,
in May, when strawberries were begin-
ning to ripen; and bossed them with
forceful patience and suavity until the
last blackberry was off the vines in Au-
gust. The inhabitants of old John-
sing were a lawless people in those
days, but it was Tweedys boast that in
ten years there had been no killings
in his gang, and scarcely ever a fight or
a drawn knife, while the quarreling was
only enough to give a little human in-
terest to the long, hard seasons. Year
after year the same families joined his
force. Friendships or jealousies which
had been interrupted during the winter
began afresh along the strawberry rows,
and ran their course from the bleak, chilly,

showery days when Tweedy kindled a
bonfire on the edge of the field, so that
his gang could warm its numbed hands
and dry its dew - drenched clothing, to
other days of perfect sunshine and de-
light; and on to others still, when the
aroma of the raspberries hung like an
overpowering incense in the quivering
air, and Tweedy advised the pickers to
put moist raspberry leaves in their hats
and bonnets to keep off the sun.
	It was the beginning of such a day
of fainting heat, and Tweedy had made
the rounds of the field with a water-
bucket and a dipper. He passed over
a little rise of ground, and found him-
self near a girl who had fairly buried her
head in the waving branches of a tall
raspberry bush, and was searching for
the great, red, perfect berries which grow
beneath the leaves.

down the bucket, and taking off his hat
to wipe his forehead. The girl did not
seem to hear, so he stood a moment</PB></P>

and dry its dew - drenched clothing, to

light; and on to others still, when the

and bonnets to keep off the sun.
	It was the beginning of such a day
of fainting heat, and Tweedy had made
the rounds of the field with a water-
bucket and a dipper. He passed over
a little rise of ground, and found him-
self near a girl who had fairly buried her
head in the waving branches of a tall
raspberry bush, and was searching for
the great, red, perfect berries which grow
beneath the leaves.

looking at her. Her skirt was soaked
to the waist with the heavy dew which
shimmered on the leaves and berries,
her sleeves were wet to the shoulders
and clung about her strong round arms,
and even the ruffle of her sunbonnet was
limp from brushing against the vines.
It was very early although it was so
warm. The sun was low in the east, and
its light fell in an almost level flood of
gold across the tops of the vines, which
were all staked and trained high, so that
the field looked like a vineyard. Far
away towprd the horizon, the morning
shadows were still lurking among the
wild blue hills. It seemed a pity that
the girl should be soaked with dew and
have her head buried in a raspberry
bush. Tweedy tried a new tone. Look
out you pick them berries clean, Cynthy
Lence, he said.
	She straightened herself, and pushed
her bonnet back from a calm-looking
face with moist curls flattened against
lie temples. Pears to me, when I stand
on my haid in a bush, it s a sign I in
searchin pretty close for em, she an-
swered, freeing the curls with her hand.
	Tweedy lifted the dripping dipper out
of the bucket and held it toward her.
I knowed you would nt stop workin
long enough to take a drink lessn I
faulted yore work, he said. It aint
my place, as boss, to make a fuss about
anybodys doin too much; but jus count-
in myself as Abe rrwiddy, I caint sense
why you drive yoreself so hard. If you
want to show that you can pick two boxes
to Buck Andersons one, you done that
long ago.
	The girl had come a step toward him
to take the dipper, but her hand dropped
and she did not take it.
	Pshaw! he said, holding it out fur-
ther. She shook her head. Pshaw!
he repeated, you re the faithfulest
worker I ye got in this field; you dont
need any boss, an someway I caint never
eount myself as anything but Abe Twid-
dy when I m talkin to you. . . . Stan
still a minute; it s bound to be said. I
caint help seem that you-uns is workin
yoreself so unmerciful jus because Buck
Anderson married that old Widder Tate
instead of you. He s a heap sorrier
about it n you be, an she s run him
right up agia the wall, too; he das nt
lift a eyelash lessn she says, Eyelashes
up like we used to play. It dont look
to me like there s the stuff in him for a
girl to keer so much about.
	The girl was looking at him so stead-
ily that he began to hesitate. You see,
Cynthy, I m a mighty old acquaintance
of yorn, he apologized. I been boss-
in you now since you was jus big enough
to stan under the raspberry vines an
pull the berries offn the low branches;
they mosly went into yore mouth, too.
Now dont it look like it was tolable
nateral I should take an interest?
	She smiled at him with a sparkle of
resentment in her eyes. Nobody s
keepin you from takin an interest, if
you want to, she said. I doiit keer.
	All the rugged lines in Tweedys face
took a sudden downward turn. He was
not used to finding himself of small ac-
count, and if any one who cared had been
watching him, it would have been evi-
dent that he was not only perplexed, but
pained. At last he picked up the water-
bucket and started along the row, but,
pausing, looked at the girl again. She
had bent into the bush once more, and he
went slowly away, feeling as if he had
lost something there among the raspber-
ry leaves.
	The heat grew more oppressive as the
day went on, and Tweedy noticed the list-
less, sullen spirit of his gang. The talk
and laughter which usually passed be-
tween the rows died out, and only an
angry mother raised her voice now and
then to threaten a child, or Buck Ander-
sons wife (still known as the Widow
Tate ) was heard railing at her husband.
Tweedy himself was indefatigable in good
works and in good cheer. He took the
heavy hand - crates from the red - faced,</PB>

panting children who were carrying theni
to the shed, and, as he passed, he stopped
to joke with the row of old women who
were playing truant openly and smoking
their pipes in the shadow of a tree. But
his jokes fell back on him like those of
an actor who is facing a stolid house.
There was no air stirring, the weight of
the atmosphere rested heavy on the field,
and all the time he was thinking of Cyn-
thia with her head hidden in the rasp-
berry hush. Again and again he started
to go to see if she still had it there; but
talking to her seemed so useless that he
did not go until the whole force worked
its way over the knoll which had sepa-
rated her from the others, and he caught
sight of her &#38; dy a few bushes beyond
the place where she had been before.
She was picking as slowly and wearily
as any of the rest, and he hurried to-
ward her, reproaching himself for hav-
ing taunted her. After all, it was quite
as much a pity for her to work slowly
as to work swiftly on account of a man
like Anderson, and he was ready to tell
her so, when he noticed that Anderson
and his wife were picking on the row
next hers. Through all the season he
had been quietly keeping them at a dis-
tance from her, but that morning she
had come into the field so much earlier
than any one else that she had already
passed over the knoll when the others
began, and so he had been careless in
giving out the rows. Andersons black
head and thin shoulders were moving
rapidly toward Cynthia, but his wife had
come to a full stop, and was staring over
the bushes at the girl, with a pair of
cold blue eyes. Tweedy knew that the
Widow Tate had more ,than once drawn
a knife and attacked persons against
whom she had a prejudice; and as she
finally strode forward from one bush to
another, he fancied he could see the swing
of a knife in the limp folds of her gown;
his thoughts followed her with forebod-
ing, even while he called himself a fool,
and took off his hat and fanned himself
as if fanning up a new idea. The widow
seemed to have seen all she wished to
see of Cynthia, however, and Tweedy
drew a breath of relief as he saw her fill
the last box in her hand-crate and start
off toward the shed. Tweedy hurried
away, too, suddenly realizing that he was
not plain Abe Twiddy, but a boss, and
that this would be a good time to do a
little bossing in the parts of the field at
a distance from Cynthia; he called them
the far parts of the field.
	Meanwhile, the pickers moved slowly
along their rows, and the sun rose slow-
ly higher and shot its rays at them with
greater force. Cynthia could feel the
sharp impact of the heat upon her head;
she could feel, too, the strange piercing
of an unseen steady gaze. Thinking
the Widow Tate might still be looking
at her, she tried to keep her own eyes
doggedly upon her work; but at last she
glanced up, and saw the widows sunbon-
net just passing out of sight on its way
to the shed. It was Buck Anderson who
was looking at her. She had not seen
him so close at hand for nearly a year,
and his haggard face startled her. It
did not seem possible that this was the
man with whom she had gayly raced
the field last season; for though he
might not have been a strong man then,
he had been free and light-hearted. She
had never seen a human soul in punish-
ment before, and she took an involunta-
ry step toward him, wonder and pity in
her eyes.
	Anderson glanced over his shoulder
to be sure that his wife was out of sight,
and then hurried toward her, shaking
as if he had a chill.
	I ye wanted a chance to talk to
you, he began in a husky voice. I
pretty nigh died las winter, an I 11 die
this winter, so I can talk where a well
man would be obleeged to keep his
mouth shet. After I had axed yon-uns,
an you would nt have me, Cynthy, If
was plumb wild; I did nt keer what I
did, an I jus got married out of devil~</PB>

ment, because I knowed folkses would
say I d throwed you-uns over to git the
Widder Tates wheat farm in the bot-
toms; an I lowed it would spite you
to have the name o bein cut out by the
widder. I reckon she took me because
she had seed how fast I could work, an
she allowed I d make a right good hand
on her farm an hyar in the berry fields
before wheat harvest; but she drove me
too hard. I took a cold last winter 
He stopped with a sort of gasp from
having said so much and spoken so rap-
idly. He seemed to have very little
strength, and Cynthia noticed that he
reeled slightly and put his hand to his
head before he went on, while his eyes
sought hers with a weak mans long-
ing for compassion. She drove me to
work when I was nt fit, he began again,
trying hard not to make each word
an appeal. I had had pneumony, an
goin out like that I pretty nigh died.
	Cynthia was struggling against the
shock of the change in him. Her eyes
roamed out across the field as she lis-
tened to his nervous, hurrying voice, and
half consciously she noted how many of
the pickers had stopped work to stare
across the walls of shimmering green,
and wonder what her old lover was
saying to her while his wife was gone.
They were all like Tweedy: they thought
that she had been mourning for him.
She was glad that it was she who had
borne the humiliation of their sympathy
instead of Anderson, yet she resented
their inquisitive interest and their theo-
ries. It was not her fault that a man
too slight for her to love had loved her,
though perhaps, if she had been think-
ing less of other things, she might have
seen that he eared for her, and have
kept him from caring quite so much;
but she had thought of nothing except
to be the best and swiftest picker in
Abe Tweedys gang.
	What made you work when you
was nt fit? she asked.
	Anderson shook his head. You-uns
could nt onderstand it, he said wearily.
You-uns is one of the sort that jus
goes as they please, an dont gee nor
haw when folkses jerk the lines; but
I m mighty tender to the bit. I don
know how she did it, but she jus slipped
a curb into my mouth the first day, an
she s been a-gee-hawin an a-whippin
me up ever since. I lowed I would nt
git the chance to say airy word to you-
uns before I was drove onderground, an
I wanted to tell you that I only mar-
ried for devilment, an she s paid me
out,  that s all.
	He stopped, but his hollow, sorrowful
eyes still lingered on the girls face, and,
for the first time in her life, her heart
admitted the claim of l~s unanswered
love. Even his weakness suddenly be-
came sacred from the judgment of her
strength. Her face grew full of sorrow
for him, but though her lips moved
once or twice, she could not find a word
to say. The silence of the breathless
morning was so deep that she could
almost hear what two women were whis-
pering together in a row near by.
	Oh, Anderson began again in his
hoarse, eager voice, you dont lay np
no grudge agin me, do you? I did it
for devilment, but I ye been paid out
aready; an when I think Ive got to
go on an live with her till I die, an
have her stand by me then an shet my
eyes, I reckon I 11 have paid more than
the little spite it was to you to have a
man you did nt keer for throw hissef
away.
	Cynthia went a step closer to him,
regardless of the sharp laugh with which
the women ended their conference in
the other row.  Her heart seemed to
beat itself against a barrier of wordless-
ness. Buck, she said, I m mighty
sorry for you, an if I ye ever laid up
any grudge or keered a little, it aint any-
thing beside what you ye been through;
an I 11 say it before my Maker, it s all
my fault. I  I wisht there was some-
thing I could do.</PB>

	Anderson looked at her, wondering if
all the feeling in her face could be for
him; and when he saw it really was for
him, a sob came up into his throat, and
with a single broken word he went back
to his row.
	Just then Tweedy came along, his
water - bucket swinging at his side.
What s the matter? lie asked Cyn-
thia. You ye scarcely moved a foot
since I was talkin to you an hour ago.
	She smiled a little, and there was still
something tender in her eyes. Pears
to me you-uns is mighty hard to please
to-day, Mr. Twiddy, she replied. A
hour ago you was faultin me cause I
picked too fast.
	Well, you was pickin too fast, he
said, and his voice was testy; thar s a
gait betwixt runnin yore head off an
standin still.
	He had never spoken like that to her
before, and she looked at him with a
startled face. I was tryin to please
you-uns, she began, that is, in the
first place. Jus the las few minutes I
been talkin to Buck Anderson.
	So J ye heard an seen, he said.
The word of it is clear acrost the
field.
	Her features hardened. An you
come acrost to stop it ? she inquired.
	Well, hem the boss, I naterally have
to come this way once in a while, he
returned evasively, stooping to pull off
a red berry she had missed. It did not
prove to be as ripe as he had thought.
He jerked at it until it crumbled in his
hand, and then laughed as he threw the
pieces away. She watched him scorn-
fully, but when he finally looked up at
her, though his lips still laughed, his
eyes were as frank and steady as her
own. I m in an awkward place, Cyn-
thy, he said. I know you think I
meddle too much, an yet I m bound to
keep things as quiet an peaceable as I
can; an somehow, I m hound likewise
to keep you from trouble, if I can. I
know you call it yore own business if
you choose to pass a word with Buck,
same as if he was any other man, an
so t is; an yet this whole field has got
its eyes open a - watchin, so whatever
the Widder Tate dont see, she 11 hear.
You dont know her the way I do. I
room next em in the barracks, an I
hear her goin for him nights. She s
the illest-natured woman I ever met up
with, an if she gets a notion that you
an him is takin notice again, thar 11 be
the devil to pay. I wisht you d promise
me, Cynthy, not to speak him airy other
word.
	The girl shut her lips. If thar s
the devil to pay, I reckon them that
owes him 11 have to do it. I aint never
had no dealins with him, she said.
	But that s the trouble with the old
boy, Cynthy, the foreman explained.
He jus collects whar he has a mind
to, without lookin at his books. An
thar s another thing,  though it aint
easy for a man to name it to a honest
girl that he s seed growia up right out
of the shadder of the vines, the way you
have: even if the widder did nt jump
on you with a knife some time when
you was nt lookin, thar s nothin like a
fieldful of long-tongued berry-pickers to
blacken a girls name.
	Cynthia set her hand-crate down very
slowly under the bushes, and her hands
fell by her sides. Oh, Mr. Twiddy,
she said, do you think I keer? If they
can make me black so easy, I d ruther
be made black an have it done. I dont
reckon such kind o talk as theirn 11

Bible says about them that have not
charity,  they are become as soundin
brass an tinklin simlins. What do I
keer if all their round simlin heads bob
up an rattle together all acrost the
field?
	Sist! whispered Tweedy. There
was a murmur in the air as if a breeze
had arisen to shake all the pickers</PB>

tongues. Here and there heads leaned
across rows to meet heads leaning from
the other side. Some were turned to
look at Cynthia and Tweedy, and at An-
derson, who was walking in a queer
dazed way beside his row, and picking
scarce a berry. Others were looking
With interest at the Widow Tate, as she
marched heavily and slowly down the
path from the shed.
	Cynthias lips curved disdainfully.
They had ought to thank me an Buck,
she said. They aint feelin half so
played out with the heat as they was a
hour ago.
	Pore child! Tweedy sighed, as if
he were summing up all her waywardness
and his pity for her. You dont mind
it very much now, an you dont need to,
cause it 11 die out if it aint fed; but
caint you pictur how it ud be if it kep
on? I ye had flies buzz about my head
till I was nigh distracted, but I suppose
you think it ud bemean you to take no-
tice of a fly.
	I ye heard em, Cynthia said.
They ye kep a-buzzin in my ears jus
the way you-uns does, an whenever I
brushed em off they d come right back.
Mr. Twiddy, you-uns is so skeered o
peoples tongues, dont you reckon yore
gang 11 be puttin our names together if
you spen so much time bossin me, when
I m knowed to be the best an fastest
picker in the field?
	Her tone stung Tweedy, and for a mo-
ment a glow of resentment tried to fight
its way through the sunburn on his face;
but as he stared at her, seeking for a re-
tort, and yet uncertain whether to retort
or to turn on his heel, something spoke
to him out of the unchanging depths of
his tenderness for her, and he under-
stood the burning of injustice, the suf-
fering, and the humiliation which held
council behind her curving lips and
brightened eyes. The anger died out of
him, just as discord gives way to silence
or to something sweeter, and he looked
at the girl in a way that she could not
understand. And yet there was nothing
he could say to her, and he turned away,
leaving her wishing that he had spoken,
so that her own words might not sound
so clearly in her ears.
	The ripe berries were gleaming con-
spicuously along the row where Buck
Anderson had hurried forward without
picking them, and Tweedy, in his official
character, could not pass them by. He
walked swiftly from bush to hush, sweep-
ing off a berry here and there as he
passed, until he had a handful of the
red, fragrant, half-melting jewels with
which to accuse Andersons carelessness;
but Anderson was nowhere to be seen.
Tweedy went on, glancing between the
bushes; for lie expected to find Buck
stooping somewhere out of sight, picking
from the low branches. Along the row
from the other end the Widow Tate
was approaching; she was looking for
Anderson, too, her hard eyes resting an
instant on every bush, seeking for some
stir among the leaves. Presently she hur-
ried forward, calling loudly,  What s
the matter with you? What you doin
down thar ?
	Tweedy came up and found her stand-
ing beside Anderson, who had fallen be-
tween the bushes and lay in their shadow.
Something of the green tint of the leaves
was on his face, and he looked as if he
were dead, but the widow did not kneel
to touch him; she only bent, looking a
little closer, and stirred him with her
foot, repeating her questions.
	Tweedy stooped, and passed a hand
across his head and felt above his heart.
	The widow straightened up and f old-
ed her arms. He s only playiii off,
she said. He does hit when he gits
tired o work.
	Several of the pickers had already ga-
thered, and were elbowing one another
around the two bushes which sheltered
Anderson, but they waited for Tweedy
to speak.
	I reckon it s sunstroke, Tweedy
said. We 11 carry him straight to the</PB>

barracks, Mis Anderson, an put him in
wet blankets. I dont know what the
chances are, but I m afeard  He
reached out for his water - bucket, and
dashed its contents over Andersons head
and face.
	Oh, he 11 git well, the woman said
in her harsh voice, which was sometimes
more cruel than her thought. Hit takes
a mighty little to git him down, an a
mighty lot to git him up; but he 11 git
well, an I 11 have him to nuss all through
wheat harvest.
	Cynthia had come up with the others,
and when she saw Anderson the sunken
blankness of his features appealed to all
in her that was strongest and most gen-
tle. After his wife had spoken there
was a moment of silence, and then Cyn-
thia leaned toward Tweedy and said very
slowly and clearly, Let me watch be-
side him, so he 11 not wake up to be
twitted with the trouble that he s made.
I 11 take keer of him if he lives, an if
he dont live 1 11 not begrudge the time
it took me to shet his eyes.
	So many people had heard her that
Tweedy could not ignore what she had
said. Dont be foolish, Cynthy, he
answered quietly, although he felt out-
raged by her folly. Mis Anderson
am t goin to grudge nothin to the pore
feller, now he s down. If you want to
help, run to the shed and tell Mr. Floyd
to send a man on horseback after the
doctor.
	Cynthia beckoned to a boy, and seat
him on the errand. Some of the men
helped Tweedy to lift Anderson and
carry him down the row; most of the
pickers followed, and, with the green
barriers on either hand to prevent strag-
gling, the little procession started to leave
the field. Cynthia fell into the line, but
Andersons wife stood at one side, like a
spectator, her face and figure quite rigid
except for the slow swelling of the veins
upon her forehead. A report that she
had stayed behind reached Tweedy, and
he halted. Come on, Mis Anderson~
an git things ready for him! he called
back, trying to make his tone ignore Cyn-
thias interference; and then, more sharp-
ly, as the woman did not stir, Come
on!
	She came on with long, cumbrous
strides, overtaking the bearers just as
they left the field. You-uns need nt
call me, Abe Twiddy, she said, stepping
into the foremans path and confronting
him with a heavy, quivering face, 
you-uns need nt call me to come an
nuss a man that married me to be took
keer of, when his pore triflin heart was
bound up in Cynthy Lence. I ye seed
him stan an look at her acrost the rows.
He would have took up with her soon or
late, an now that she s spoke like she
did to spite me, I make her a free gift
of him, alive or dead. She turned on
Cynthia, who had come forward, with her
head raised and her eyes sparkling, as if
to accept the gift. I Oh, I know what s
kep you-uns from lookin at him or speak-
in to him all the season, she cried, 
you - uns has been afeard o me; but
now I take all these men an women t~
witness that you need nt be afeard o me
no more. I m goin back to the bot-
toms to harvest my wheat, an I make
you-uns a free gift of him. Look at him,
an see if hit dont do you proud to git
what you been seekin fur so long.
	Tweedys eyes took fire. Go, he
said,  go, Mis Anderson, an dont
bring yore black heart acrost my path
agin. You - uns has been tired o yore
bargain these months back, an now yore
makin a girls quick speech the excuse
for throwin off what you dont want
onto her, an tryin to put a slur onto her
at the same time. I know yore kind.
You git mad, an then you make yore
temper serve yore turn. Take yoreself
ont o this field, but dont you let man,
woman, or child hear you say that you
gave yore husband to Cynthy Lence, or
I 11 see to it that yore tongue s stiffened
so you caint say it agin. I give you-
uns, an all you-uns that s listenin, to</PB>

onderstand that, alive or dead, Buck An-
derson is lef with me.
	He started forward, leaving the wo-
man glowering after him on the edge of
the field. Some of the pickers stayed
with her, talking in an eager group; the
others followed more silently toward the
barracks. Cynthia walked beside Twee-
dy. I thank you - uns for closin her
mouth, she said, but I want to take
keer of Buck, jus the same.
	You caint, said Tweedy shortly.
	But I want to, the girl insisted.
I I owe it to him, Mr. Twiddy.
	Tweedy had borne a great deal that
day; the last shred of his patience was
worn through, and his personal feeling
was mingled in such an inextricable tan-
gle with his duty that it seemed useless
for him to try to tell what was the right
thing to do, or to make a stand for doing
it, even if he could decide. The girl was
her own keeper, after all. You know
what y&#38; re askin, an what it means?
he said.
	I know that I m askin to do the las
thing that one human can do for anoth-
er, Mr. Twiddy, Cynthia answered,
looking at him as if she had suddenly
grown older than he. You-uns knows
that Buck Anderson aint goin to git
well.
	Tweedy was too human and too sorely
tried to rise to what she asked of him.
We 11 take him to his room, an turn
the widders things out of it, he said
gruffly, an you-uns can do as you please
about sittin thar an keepin watch.
	Thank you, Mr. Twiddy, the girl
said, with a deference that was galling
after she had made her point.
	When they reached the long, many-
roomed shed known as the barracks,
Tweedy turned upon his troop of curi-
ous-eyed, pusj7ling, busy-tongued retain-
ers, almost as if h&#38; saw for the first
time that they had left the field. We
dont want no crowdin an gabbhin
here, he said sharply. Me an Cyn-
thy is all that s needed, an out yonder
the berries are meltin on the vines. Go
back to yore rows an work yore peartest
till I come an give you the news. If
the Widder Tate is hangin around, tell
her to yoke up her oxen an git. She 11
find her plunderment lyin here outside
the door. He and the men who were
helping him laid Anderson down on a
straw pallet, and then he started off to the
well for water to keep up the cold drench-
ing which had been his first thought in
the field; the others went with the re-
treating gang of pickers back to their
work.
	As Cynthia watched them go, and
waited for Tweedy to come back with
his unfailing, practical water - buckets,
she seemed bitterly unneeded. Ander-
son might never return to consciousness;
and even if he wakened, the mere ab-
sence of his wife would be more than he
had hoped for as a final grace. The
murmuring of voices died away as the
pickers ambled out of her hearing, but
she knew that, freed from Tweedys pie-
sence and her own, every tongue was un-
bridled out there among the raspberries.
In spite of Tweedys championship there
would be no more escape from comment
than from the heat that was glimmering
everywhere,  over the green fields and
the dry ploughed ground, and far over
the faint, quivering, shadowless hills.
Even the few, like Tweedy, who would
take her part against the others would
be convinced that she had defied Ander-
sons wife from love of Anderson; and
as she stood there waiting, she went
down into that place of regret and futile
rebellion where generous natures some-
times pay the price of their unselfishness,
and the tears that start burning toward
the eyelids freeze before they fall. Then
Tweedy came hurrying from the well,
and the fight for Andersons useless life
began.
	The doctor came late and went quick-
ly, leaving no encouragement behind
him; and as all effort to revive Anderson
grew into the conscientious formality with</PB>

which the living strive to detain the
dying, even when their engagement with
death is inevitable, Tweedy, in his turn,
began to feel useless in the room. The
persistence with which Cynthia knelt
beside the unconscious man compelled
Tweedy to defer to her, and he left her
frequently, to go out and supervise the
field. In one of his absences Cynthia
heard a stir outside, and, glancing up,
saw the Widow Tate and a few compan-
ions corning up the slope toward the bar-
racks, trying to prod the inertia out of a
pair of oxen who had been in pasture and
were loath to change their way of life.
Cynthia did not look again, but she was
acutely conscious of every motion that
was made and every word that was spoken
while the oxen were yoked to a heavy
lumber wagon, and the scanty and disor-
dered furnishings outside the door were
gathered up. A shadow darkened the
doorway, and the girl knew that some one
was standing there with arms akimbo,
and looking at her. Other shadows came
in silence; then there was a hoarse
laugh, they all turned away, and Cynthia
heard the widow clamber into her wagon
and crack her whip like a man; the
wagon-wheels began to creak, and finally
to rattle, as the weight of the wagon
urged the oxen into a rapid pace down-
hill.
	Twilight fell at last like an absolution
for the tortured spirit of the day. Even
the voices of the pickers were hushed to
a sort of peace, as they straggled in from
work, and began to build little outdoor
fires that sparkled brightly in front of
the barracks, under the shadow of the
trees. The women bent over the fires,
cooking, and voice called to voice, asking
or offering the commonplace services of
life, but with unusual gentleness, as peo-
ple speak when at any moment a guest
may enter. Tweedy neither stayed long
with Cynthia nor was long absent, but
guarded her in every way and saw that
she needed nothing. When twilight bad
changed to night, and the little evening
fires had all gone out, except here and
there a coal that blinked like a red glow-
worm in the dark, he stood beside her for
a little while, looking down at her and at
Anderson. The thought of himself had
yielded utterly to a great compassion for
the sad ending of their love. Anderson
would die that night, and he could not
bear that Cynthia should feel that even
the kindest eyes were watching her, un-
less she wished it, when the final renun-
ciation came.
	Do you want me to stay with you ?
he asked, after a time. If I dont stay,
I 11 be right next door, an I 11 hear if
you even tap on the wall. I thought per-
haps you d ruther be alone.
	As the girl looked up at him, the lamp-
light glistened upon teardrops in her
eyes. Thank you, Mr. Twiddy, she
answered,  you-uns is mighty kind.
I d ruther be alone.
	Tweedy hardly knew what he did. He
stooped suddenly and kissed her fore-
head. You pore child! he whispered,
and left the room.
	During the long hours of the night Cyn-
thia had the long years of her future
for companionship. The white moon-
light came in at the doorway, and crept
toward Anderson, and finally retreated,
fearing to intrude. Once or twice she
heard Tweedy get up from his bed, and
pace softly back and forth in his room,
and with the knowledge that he was
awake her longing for his companionship
grew almost into a cry. Once she went
to the door and looked out over the lone-
ly raspberry field, where a thin white
fog had settled under the moonlight; but
the breath of it was cold, and she feared
that Anderson might open his eyes and
not find her, if his soul returned to ask
for a farewell, before it went upon the
way which it was seeking in the dark.
	A change had come over him even in
the moment she was gone. He breathed
in sharper and more infrequent gasps,
and the lines of death had sunk deeper
in his face. She bent above him, watch-</PB>

ing with such intense sympathy that her
own breathing seemed almost linked with
his, as she waited for each throe, think-
ing that each would be the last. But
with the tenacity of feebleness his life
fought on and on. At last, quite unex-
pectedly to herself, Cynthia tapped upon
the wall. Tweedy was with her in an in-
stant; and when she reached out a trem-
bling hand, he took it without a word,
and they watched together while the gray
light of morning gradually dispelled the
moonlight, and on until full dawn, when
Anderson died.
	Cynthia knelt beside him for a little
while, but she did not need to close his
eyes, for they had not opened to look at
her. It was as if, at the moment when
he turned away from her in the field, he
had known that he had all it was right
for him to claim, and his heart had been
too full to ask for more.
	Tweedy stood apart and waited until
she came to him. Then they went out-
side. There was no stir yet about the
barracks, for the overworn pickers were
sleeping beyond their usual time. The
sun had not risen, but its clearly drawn
rays spread like a crown above the east-
ern hills, and the sky was scintillant.
Only the lower hills and the deep green
valleys lay shadowless and still in the
diffusion of brightness, like a childs fea-
tures that are waiting solemnly for life
to set its seal of character upon them.
	Tweedy broke the silence in a low
voice. I spoke hard to you-uns yes-
terday, more n once, Cynthy, he said,
but I want you to forgit it all, if you
can. I was only wantia to see you as
happy as you had a chance to be; but
now that I see how much deeper yore
misry was than I reckoned, thar aint
nothin but sorrow for you in my heart
an love.
	The last word was spoken so gently,
so much as an added tenderness, that it
could not have pained or offended the
deepest sorrow, yet Cynthia was startled
by it. She looked at him curiously.
You-uns does well to pity me, she
said. I dont keer what all the others
says an thinks, but I want you-uns to
know the truth, cause you wont be on-
charitable, even to Buck. I aint never
loved him. It was him loved me.
	Tweedy passed his hand across his
brow. You-uns did it all for a man
you did nt love, lie exclaimed,  you
dared all them tongues?
	She nodded. I  I owed it to him.
Without knowin, I had led him on.
	Tweedy looked off over the hushed,
expectant earth. My God, lie said
softly, what would you do for the man
you loved?
	The girls breath came in an unex-
pected sob. Oh, Mr. Twiddy, she
faltered, I might have to tell him so.
He might nt know it for hissef.
	Tweedy turned. Her face was tremu-
lous, but consecrated by the love which
she had hidden for so long; and as their
eyes met they forgot that there was any-
thing but love in all the world. The
glory brightened in the east, and the air
stirred like an awakening along the fields.
One after another the sleepy pickers came
out of the barracks, saw the two figures
below them on the hillside, and whis-
pered back and forth with brightening
eyes.
	At last Tweedy put her gently away
from him. I had ought to go an call
the gang, an tell them that pore Buck is
gone.~~
	Cynthia glanced over her shoulder
and laughed as she saw the pickers bend-
ing discreetly to kindle their morning
fires. The simhins has been watchin,
she said, an they 11 be tinkhin pearthy
to.day. Do you keer?
	Tweedy shook his head. Before them
sunshine and shadow flashed like a smile
across the earth, as the sun rose over the
distant hills.

THE COMMODORE.

	I REMEMBER him as well as though
I had seen him yesterday. There are
some figures that memory does in sil-
houette, and that of my grandfather is
one,  the lines all definite and clear,
and standing out above the flotsam and
jetsam of the human tide like some
grand old figurehead. A tall man, a
little stooped about the shoulders, with
long, thin arms and legs which seemed
to be without bones, so that he could tie
them up and twist them about, and fling
them out in a rattling old hornpipe, such
as I have never seen performed by any
one else, before or since.

although the same might be said of my
grandmother; for in proportion to my
grandfathers love for a roving life was
her aversion to going abroad. Well, as
I said, she lay at anchor off the Navy
Yard, over which the Commodore was in
command. Every day of his life  and

to the dock, threw off his land togs, took
a header into the water, and, with a

climbed the rigging like a cat, scram-

and never drawing breath till he had put

	Summer or winter, it was the same to
him. My grandmother, who was a very
aristocratic and proper personage, poor,
dear lady, went to great pains to prepare
a bathing-suit and bath-towel for these
aquatic exploits. One fine day the whole
Navy Yard was startled to behold Hard
Tack, my grandfathers great Newfound-
land dog, going from pillar to post in a
full suit of bed-ticking trimmed with scar-

flapped when he walked, and they came
up almost to his chin, under his waist-

the sea, and his hair on either temple was
soft and white as the crest of a wave. He
carried under his arm a brass spyglass,
which he delighted in leveling upon
certain ladies who on sunny afternoons
took coy promenades, under funny little
parasols, on the parade-ground. He had
one habit which my grandmother had
tried in vain to break. This was to
whittle. Wherever he went he carried
an old black clasp-knife and a piece of
pine wood. Clothes-pins were his predi-
lection, and he could be tracked all over
the Navy Yard, from one end to the
other, by a trail of shavings; and as he
whittled he hummed in a monotonous
voice, which seemed to start somewhere
under his cap and come down through
his nose, The Girl I left behind Me.
This was his favorite tune; I do not think
he ever knew any other, and he could
never quite master that, but after a few
bars would run foul of Days of Absence,
and get beached on Oft in the Stilly
Night, two exhilarating ditties much af-
fected by my grandmother. At this he
would pull up taut, with a pucker and
a long breath, back water, and go at it
afresh, until he had launched his original
theme successfully on waters which were
not always confluent.
	Everybody loved the Commodore, but
I think the two human beings who were
perhaps the most reckless in their admi-
ration were myself and a wretched old
hulk of a creature, whom my grand-
father, for reasons best known to him-
self, called  Shuttlecock. No one knew
him by any other name, and no one knew
where he hailed from, except that the
Commodore had picked him up some-
where during the war of 1812, and
brought him home with him,  that is to
say, as much as was left of the poor fel-
low after the battle of Lake Erie. Not
only did my grandfather give to this
remnant of humanity a living, but he
bestowed upon him in addition a wooden
leg, a glass eye, an ear-trumpet, and a
piece of white plaster to cover the place
where his nose had been. For alas!
Shuttlecocks nose had been blown off on
the field of battle. His winter quarters
were in a small, square house, built of
stone, with neither doors nor windows.
It had a chimney on top and an iron
scuttle, and it was a blood-curdling sight
to see old Shuttlecock, with a rope lad-
der twisted about his waist, crawling,
in the dusk of winter, like a huge limpet
over the gray walls, to drop mysterious-
ly down through the roof. This rude
dwelling was set where the beach was
bleak and the waves rolled high. But
when summer set in be betook himself
to a fishing - cabin, which was simply a
small one - roomed hut set on a raft,
which my grandfather had brought up
from Chesapeake Bay, and which, by
his orders, had been anchored under
the protection of the lee shore. Here
old Shuttlecock fished, smoked his pipe,
and sat and stewed in the hot sun from
its rising to its setting. A more harm-
less, happy soul than he never breathed.
My grandfather knew this, and I knew
it too, and it little mattered to old Shut-
tlecock that he was an object of aversion
and terror to everybody else for miles
around, my grandmother included, who
invariably explained him as a pensioner
of her husbands. This made the Com-
modore angry, and he would hasten
to correct the impression of patronage
which her term implied. Crony, sir, 
Shuttlecock is my crony, sir, I beg you
to understand; and if it is a question of
pensioner, then the term should be ap-
plied to me, and not to him. No one
ever knew what the service rendered my
grandfather had been, but, whatever its
nature, it had bound the two men to-
gether with bonds which no worldly con-
sideration could break.
	Mrs. Catherine Cull had been my
mothers nurse, and now was mine.
Every Saturday afternoon, when the
weather allowed, my grandfather would
take her and me, and Hard Tack the
dog, and Plum Duff the tiger cat, and</PB>

a large white canvas bag in which he
had put baccy and grog and fruit and
all sorts of goodies. Then we would be
tumbled into a rowboat, and the Coin-
inodore would pull us across the bay
to Shuttlecocks cabin. Such ecstatic
afternoons! The light in the old fel-
lows one eye, when he turned it on my
grandfather, seemed to illuminate all the
place. We made lemonade in a conch
shell, and we ate strawberries out of lit-
tle black and blue mussel shells, and we
had bread and butter spread by Nurse
Cull with the Commodores knife when
he was not whittling, and he and old
Shuttlecock would drink their grog and
spin their yarns, the wooden leg bobbing
up and down the little cabin with a
gentle hospitality which I have missed in
many a grander host since then. Plum
Duff on my grandfathers knee, and
Hard Tack at his feet, looked on with
superior approval.
	My grandfather loved animals. I was
a little shaver in long clothes when he
came home from his three years cruise
along the African coast and through the
Indian Ocean. But Nurse Cull would
tell me how, when his lady went down
to the dock to meet the Commodore,
after their long separation, she was scan-
dalized to behold a flaming macaw flap-
ping its gaudy wings on top of his head,
an ape perched on his shoulder, and in
his arms a huge tiger cat, the subse-
quent Plum Duff. He had made the
ships gig which conveyed him to the
shore a veritable Noahs ark. Now, as
my grandmother could not abide ani-
mals, the sight did not add to the rap-
ture of her welcome. What she would
have done had she been aware that a
ring-tailed lemur was sound asleep in his
roomy coat-tail pocket, I do not dare to
think. Matters went from bad to worse,
till one day a baby basket, an elaborate
affair with its quilted lining of rose-
colored silk and lace and ribbon bows,
which had been prepared against an ex-
pected event, disappeared. Not a trace
could be found of it, until some days
later it leaked out, after the arrival of
my little sister, that my grandfather
had appropriated the basket for Plum
Duff.
	That, certainly, was bad enough, but
wait until you hear what happened to the
baby herself. Like the basket, she too
disappeared, one fine day. She was just
two months to a day when this occurred,
and she came very near never being a
day older. Nurse Cull, as was her cus-
tom, had left the little creature sound
asleep under the mosquito-netting of her
bassinet, after first preparing for her a
decoction greatly in vogue at that time
for babies. It was a wad made of bread
and milk and brown sugar rubbed to-
gether and tied up in white cambric.
Babies whose mouths closed upon this
detestable mess were supposed to go to
sleep without a whimper. The afternoon
was hot and drowsy. Nurse Cull, I f an-
cy, must have dropped off herself, in the
next room, for she asserted, on the honor
of an honest woman, that she heard no
sound from the nursery, but that, at five
oclock, when she put down her sewing
to take the baby up, she found the cradle
empty. Then there was a hue and cry,
not only up the street, but down the
street. The man in the sentry-box, the
marines on dress parade, the men in
the brass band, everybody, men, women,
and children, in the Yard, turned out in
the hunt. My poor mother grew wild-
eyed and wan as she went here, there,
and everywhere, to return to the emp-
ty cradle. Her white face must have
scared even my grandfather, when he
came home from a long afternoon down
the bay. What is it, Polly, my girl?
he said. My mother could only wail out,
My baby,  oh, my baby!
	I did not tell you, I think, that on land
the Commodore was one of the most
absent-minded of men. But at sea no
one ever caught him napping. A sud-
den rush of recollection at the sight of
my mother sent the blood from his face,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00244" SEQ="0244" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="238">	238	The Commodore.

until it was as white as her own. He
jerked the timepiece from his fob pocket.
It lacked fifteen minutes to the sunset
gun. We all thought he had gone stark,
staring mad when he ran down the stairs,
three at a time, and out at the door, no
hat on his head, his hair streaming, and
tore down the road like one possessed.
The men in the ships boat which had
fetched him ashore were well on their way
hack, but his whistle, loud and shrill,
brought them to with a vengeance, and in
a jiffy he had leaped into the stern sheets
and was commanding the men to pull
as they had never pulled hefore. A
twenty-dollar gold piece to every Jack
Tar of you, if you get me within speak-
ing distance of the ship before that 
shaking his fist in the face of the great
dog-day sun which was fast sliding into
the water goes down! His voice,
ringing out like a trumpet, was the only
sound except that of the oars in the
rowlocks. No one, not even my mother,
knew exactly what terrible thing was
impending, but every one surmised that
it must have something to do with the
missing baby. Under the sharp, strong
strokes of the sailors the boat slid over
the glassy sea as fast as a fish could swim.
The Commodores eyes glared at the
great red ball rolling down toward the
waters edge as though he would fix it
stock-still in the sky.
	We on the dock could see the gun-
ner come on the ships deck, his figure
standing out black and grim against the
crimson west. Clinging to my mothers
hand, which trembled in mine, I looked
back to the house to see that my grand-
mother stood in her open window, very
pale and more proud than ever. I think
she was the only one who knew that my
grandfather was at the bottom of this ex-
citement, as indeed he was of everything
that ever caused a stir in our quiet lives.
Nurse Cull caught the glass, which my
mother had no strength to hold, and,
looking through it, saw that the gunner
carried his iron rammer, bag of powder,
and wad of cotton,  it being before the
days of the percussion cap. The sun
grew redder and bigger as it neared the
heaving water-line. There was not the
length of an oar between sea and sun
when we could see my grandfather spring
to his feet in the hoat and roar something
at the men who were pulling for dear
life. The tone was so terrible that we
could hear it even on shore. The sail-
ors bent their hacks till their noses were
flattened on their knees and the ribbons
on their caps stood out straight behind.
And then, with a pull that lifted the
boat clean out of the water, with a tre-
mendous spurt, they brought it well up
to the ships side. Again did the Com-
modore thunder out something in that
awful tone, this time to the man who
was about to ram the charge into the
black belly of the cannon, so that he
let everything fall upon the deck. The
great red disk of the sun was now draw-
ing itself under the waves. But before
it had quite disappeared my grandfather
had cleared the bulwarks of the Gram-
pus and snatched from the black mouth
of the gun a something long and white
and fluttering,  something which at a
distance looked like a bolster-case, but
which caused my poor mother to faint
dead away.
	A great crowd bad gathered on the
dock by this time, and oh, what a shout
they sent up! The baby! the baby! the
baby is saved! Hurrah for the baby!
With a three times three and a tiger for
the baby! This brought my mother to,
and I remember how she laughed and
cried and kissed me, and how all the
women had their handkerchiefs out, and
the men, too, as many as had them.
Then across the water came the great
boom of the sunset gun,  for the first
time in its history just one minute after
the sun had dipped below the horizon.
This was the signal for the sky to un-
furl itself like a rose, and, blown by
some invisible wind, to disperse in little
clouds, which floated rosy and pink in</PB>

the golden twilight. So that, in my child-
ish fancy, quickened by Hans Andersen,
I thought the good angels were scatter-
ing rose leaves upon the boat which was
bringing my little sister back to us. She
lay in my grandfathers arms, with her
long white dress floating out in the breeze,
and his cheek pressed against hers. Then,
as the boat came dancing over the waves,
the marine band struck up the Commo-
dores favorite tune, The Girl I left be-
hind Me, and to its spirited measures
and amid general rejoicing he landed his
precious cargo.
	After this little pleasantry on my grand-
fathers part, he did own up to the babys
abduction, but he would never acknow-
ledge having forgotten her in the can-
nons belly. He said that it was only a
joke to shake us up out of our dumps and
doldrums. But for all that he was very
meek and well behaved up to the day of
the babys christening, and then he took
umbrage at both my grandmother and
my mother because they objected when
he, as sponsor, sprang the name Gram-
pussina upon my sisters unoffending
head. Fortunately, the clergyman was
deaf, and this gave my mother a chance
to set matters straight. Having most
effectually put both the women in the
east by noreast, as he expressed it, the
Commodore went off in high dudgeon
for a weeks visit in New York.
	The relations between my mater-
nal grandparents were most certainly
strained. I doubt if my grandmother
s&#38; id good-by to her husband, when he
started out for New York, a consider-
able journey in those days. Young as
I was, I marveled at this, because over
and over again I had heard my ~mother
tell what a romantic love-match theirs
had been, and how the fashionable world
of Baltimore was up in arms when the
beautiful young heiress, Cornelia Mac-
Tavish Dulaney Hopkins, stole away
from her fathers house, in the dead of
night, with a flowered bandbox and a
dashing young officer, who had risen by
bravery from ships cabin boy to lieu-
tenant. I have told you what an aristo-
cratic name was my grandmothers, but
my grandfather, who had no use for the
grandiloquent, always called her Polly
Hopkins.
	Well, he did not stop out his week in
New York, but came back after the
third day. It was in the afternoon of a
scorching day in September,  not a
breath on land or sea. My grandmother
and I and the baby were sitting under
the shade of a great butternut tree which
grew on the lawn in front of the Com-
modores house. At the sight of my
grandfather coming up the pebbled walk
with its high box border, my mother,
dear soul, whose heart was too gentle to
harbor a grudge, gave a little cry of joy,
and ran to meet him, and to receive on
her sweet face a sounding smack. But
my grandmother, who thought kissing
vulgar, turned away her cheek, so that
the salutation meant for her fell on
empty air. For all that, however, I
think that in her heart she was as glad
to have him home as we were, although
she did ask him in an icy tone if he had
brought any pets in the form of orang-
outangs, elephants, boa constrictors, or
lions from the menagerie of a certain Mr.
Barnum, who at that time was causing
the wonders of his show to burst upon the
metropolis. Meanwhile I was busying
myself with the spyglass, my grandfather
lying on the grass with Grampussina
 lie insisted upon calling her that with-
out benefit of clergy  crawling all over
him.
	Hello!~ I cried, after scanning the
offing.
	Something in my tone made my grand-
father ask, What s up, hub?
	A flag, sir, said I.
	Where?
	On old Shuttlecocks fishing-cabin.
	Well, exclaimed my grandmother,
I declare, the airs of that good-for-no-
thing old pauper, setting up his colors as
if he were the Lord High Admiral!</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00246" SEQ="0246" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="240">	240	The Commodore,

	It s a funny-looking flag, said I,
ignoring this interpolation, with my eyes
screwed up to the glass. It hangs all
limp, but I can see its color, and it s
bright yellow.
	This brought my grandfather up with
a bound. He reached for the glass, and
clapped it to his eyes.
	By Beelzebubs buttons, you re right,
boy! It s the yellow jack, and old Shut-
tlecock s down with some infernal, dev-
ilish, damned disease. And, jumping
to his feet, I m going to him.
	This was a bombshell. My grandmo-
ther expostulated, my mother wept, and
I put my nose up in the air and howled.
All to no avail. Go he must, go lie would,
and go he did. We all rose and followed
him into the house to the medicine closet,
to help him pack the old canvas bag with
such remedies as he selected from its
shelves. In addition to these there was
a large bottle of brandy, one of cherry
bounce, a roll of red flannel, and a box
of mustard. Hanging on the wall was
an old-fashioned warming-pan of polished
brass. My grandfather started off with
this over his shoulder. But when my
grandmother beheld him thus equipped,
she declared he was insulting the family
pride of the Dulaneys, and that her grand-
mothers heirloom should not be dese-
crated. Under ordinary conditions this
would have thrown the Commodore into
a towering rage, but now he only sighed,
Put the warming-pan back on the wall,
and stood on the threshold of the door,
gazing with a long, wistful look at my
grandmother. But she went on fanning
herself, and made no sign. So he turned
and left the room.
	My mother and I accompanied him
down to the dock; he, on the way, giv-
ing us careful directions for the feed-
ing of Hard Tack and Plum Duff, who
both followed him to the waters edge.
There were little knots of sailors and
marines huddled together on the planks,
speaking with horror of that yellow rag
hanging limp in the humid air.
	There were whispers of yellow fever,
Asiatic cholera, and, dreadest of all, lep-
rosy. The men were all scared to death.
My grandfather knew this, and when
the boat was lowered, and two stalwart
fellows with blanched faces stepped for-
ward to take their places at the oars,
he ordered them back. I am going
alone, he said in a firm, low voice. He
kissed my mother and me a long good-
by. Bear up, my girl, he whispered.
It s only my duty I m doing, and I
should do for old Shuttlecock what he
has done for me. If I never come back,
take good care of your mother. And
then he stooped and stroked the backs of
his two faithful comrades, the cat and
the dog.
	We watched him, through our tears,
setting out alone on that awful errand.
Under the hot sun the sea lay dead as
pulp. At each scoop of the oars might
be seen on either side of the boat a
yeasty streak, which gleamed livid for a
second, like the belly of some skulking
shark before it slunk away beneath the
waveless waters.
	The unspeakable depression which
hung over the landscape was no match
for that which had settled upon the
house when we returned to it. We
passed from room to room, each one
more empty than the others, with the
vital presence gone, perhaps forever.
On the table in the hall lay the copy
of Robinson Crusoe and the wax doll he
had brought my sister and me from New
York, together with a hamper of fruit
from Fulton Market for my mother and
grandmother. I choked at the sight.
Then we went up to my grandmothers
room. The door was shut and the key
turned from the inside. In answer to
my mothers voice she explained that she
had gone to bed with a headache from
the excessive heat; would my mother
preside for her over the tea-table ?
	I held back my sobs till the yretched
meal was over; but once alone in my lit-
tle room, I flung myself down in a wild</PB>

passion of tears, such as only childhood
knows. Then I undressed and crept
into bed, to dream that a great hero was
being buried. The marine band was
playing the Dead March in Saul, I
thought, and all the soldiers were march-
ing with arms reversed, and the marines
had crape bands on their arms, and the
barracks were hung with long black
streamers. So were Plum Duff and
Hard Tack. The drums were muffled,
and the flags were flying at half - mast,
and the minute guns were booming, and
in the distance I could hear the church
chimes in the city ringing out across the
water Adeste Fideles. Then, amid the
tumult, there fell upon my ears a sound
I had never heard before: my grand-
mother was crying to break her heart.
	I awoke from my dream to hear the
night-watch shouting, Twelve oclock,
and all s well ! The moonlight flooded
my room, and there, leaning over my
bed, was the last person in the world
whom I should have ever expected to
find there,  my grandmother! I raised
myself o,n my elbows and rubbed my
eyes to make sure that I was not still
dreaming. But no; there she was, her
face all wet with tears. She had thrown
a black lace veil over her head, across
her arms she had a white camels hair
shawl, and in her hand she held nothing
more nor less than the warming-pan of
my great - great - grandmother Dulaney.
I gaped at her, too astonished for words.
	Frank, she said in a broken voice,
would you mind getting up and dress-
ing, and going down with me to the
dock? I could not have been more
dumfounded had my grandmother then
and there proposed our mounting the
warming-pan and flying up to the moon.
I am sorry to disturb you, child, but I
thought it might create comment if I
were seen going across the yard so late
at night, by myself.
	Now, the sheer idea of my grandmo-
ther walking across the parade-ground
at the dead of night, with no other pro-
	VOL. LXXXII.  NO. 490.	16
tector than the family warming - pan,
struck me as so preposterous that I al-
most laughed aloud. But I was soon in
my clothes, and we started off on our noc-
turnal expedition. As my grandmother
felt the warm, sweet-scented night on
her cheek, she drew a long breath. I
think, too, she softly sighed. I won-
dered if she thought of that other night,
so many years ago, of which I had
heard my mother tell.
	Frank, she asked, as we hurried
across the empty parade-ground, have
you any idea what I am going to do?
	Not the dimmest, grandmother, re-
plied I stoutly, which was a deliberate
lie.
	Well, my child, I will tell you: I am
going to carry this over to your grand-
father. In her agitation she brought
the warming - pan down with a clang
upon the paving- stones. It rang out
like the tocsin of war, and I thought
that we should surely have the whole
barracks tumbling out about us. As it
was, we startled the sentinel; but I was
ready for him with the password, and he
let us go unchallenged.
	Fortunately for us, the streets were
deserted. As we neared the dock, my
grandmother again spoke.
	I am wondering, child, said she,
how we are to find a boat, at this late
~hour. I would have ordered one earlier
in the day, but, with a slight hesitancy,
I only resolved to do this half an hour
ago. Actually, she was proceeding on
the impulse of the moment!
	Dont you worry about the boat,
grandmother, I answered. I have a
beauty of my own. Grandad gave it to
me on my last birthday, when I was ten
years old. I have the key of the boat-
house in my pocket. See! I cried, hold-
ing it up in the moonlight.
	Then, after a few minutes, a more
serious question arose.
	Frank, said my grandmother, do
you think there will be any one on the
dock to row me over? I am a litt~</PB>

nervous in trusting myself to a strange
man whose habits I do not know.
	You leave that to me, grandmother,
I called out to her over my shoulder, for
I was now preceding her upon the dock.
I know a fellow who will go with you,
and his habits are all right.
	This seemed to reassure her, and with-
out more ado I brought the boat around,
and helped her down the steps and into
the stern. She gave herself up to the
novelty of the situation, having, how-
ever, before she embarked, drawn on a
very fine pair of lavender kid gloves.
No lady, born and bred, could think of
going abroad with bare hands. I took
the oars, and, righting the boat, got clear
of the small craft bobbing up and down
about the dock.
	And now, Frank, she asked, peer-
ing about in the moonlight, and resting
her gloved hands on the gunwale of the
boat, where is the man you promised
you would get to row me?
	I pulled steadily ahead for several
lengths before I answered, smiling up at
her as I leaned on my oars, Here he
is, grandmother.
	The kid gloves became deprecatory.
	Oh, Frank, Frank, you have de-
ceived me!  she cried. You said you
would get me a man.
	No, grandmother, I beg your par-
don, I did not. I said a fellow. I
said, I know a fellow, and he will go
with you, and he has no bad habits, 
which is true, is nt it? I kept on
rowing and talking with an audacious
persistency which was too much for the.
lady in the stern.
	But I cannot allow you to run into
such danger, child. You must let me
out. She said this with a sudden re-
turn to her old air of authority. You
must stop the boat and let me out this
instant,  I insist upon it!
	But you will drown if I let you out
here, unless you can use the warming-
pan as a life-preserver.
	It is ridiculous, she gasped, a
baby like you riding over his grand-
mother in this way. What will your
grandfather say.
	I do not know what he will say, but
I do know what he would do, if I did
not go with you.
	But your strength will give out,
child, before we get halfway over, she
urged in a mollified tone.
	Then we can rig up a mast and sail
out of your shawl and the warming-pan,
and trust to them to carry us over!
	This was too much for her, and she
sank back resignedly on her cushions,
conquered as much by the beauty of
the night as by me; for the night was
beautiful beyond words. The great har-
vest moon was overhead, and beneath
its light the sea lay in a golden lan-
guor. Under the spell of its enchant-
ment, youth knew the wisdom of age
without its weariness, and age knew
the freshness of youth without its folly.
It made my grandmother young, and
me old, so that, rocked on that golden
tide, the hearts of the woman and child
became one. For the first time in my
life I loved my grandmother. All the
grief and despair of the day had van-
ished; I was ecstatically happy, and so,
I think, was she. It mattered little to
either of us that the burnished pathway
over which we were passing led up to
the house of death, for we both knew
that that which was dearer than life
awaited us there. It was the unreal
which held sway. I was a very young
child to learn, as I did that night, that
it is by the unreal that the soul is en-
couraged, and that he who would en-
dure must be a dreamer.
	How young you look, dear grand-
mamma, I said, resting on my oars and
letting the boat drift, and how heauti-
ful,  just like the ivory miniature which
grandad wears about his neck!
	How odd, child! she answered. I
was just about to tell you how old you
seem to have grown, quite like a man,
since we started out together.</PB>

	Her face was tender in the golden
light, and she trailed one hand, the
gloves having been removed, in the wa-
ter, as a girl would have done.
	Do I look like that picture? she
sighed. I feel to-night just as I did
when I had it painted to give your grand-
father. That was a long time ago. I
was only eighteen.~~
	When she spoke again, it was to echo
my own thoughts.
	I have been thinking, child, she
said, that your grandfather will not be
at all surprised to see us. Everything
to-night seems so natural to me, and
just as it should be. And so, I am sure
 yes, very sure  that when he sees us
he will say that it is just what he thought
we would do. I have no right to expect
that he should think this of me, she
continued sadly, but I believe he knew
all the time that I would come.
	We were now quite close to old Shut-
tlecocks cabin. A red lantern swung
under the yellow jack, which hung black
in the shadow. My grandfather must
have seen us a long way off, for he stood
on the rafts edge, as if waiting for us.
But there was no surprise on his face,
only a great happiness. His eyes were
riveted on my grandmother. After a
little space of silence, she was the first
to speak.
	Did you think I would come, dear?
she asked.
	Yes, Polly, he replied, I was sure
of it.
	Why? she asked, and lowered her
eyes.
	Because you love me, said my
grandfather.
	No, she answered, that was not
the reason.~~
	Then, for Gods sake, what was it?
he cried, catching his breath.
	Because you love me, she said, lift-
ing her eyes, and reaching out her arms
for him to take her from the boat.
	But at this my grandfather drew back,
and broke out in vehement self-denuncia
tions. He had been weak and coward-
ly to allow us to approach so near this
awful danger, and then he drew the
most harrowing and alarming pictures
as to what the consequences would be
if we stayed a moment longer in that
pestilential place.
	Old Shuttlecock, it appeared, had been
discovered by the Board of Health in a
seemingly critical condition, and they
had diagnosed the case as Asiatic chol-
era, and taken themselves off in great
alarm.
	That is more than I shall do, de-
clared my grandmother from the boat.
I have come to share the danger with
you.~~
	But are you not afraid? said he.
I am afraid of nothing where you
are, she replied.
	Not even death? he asked.
	No, said she, again reaching out
her arms to him.
	Then bring the boat alongside, hub.
I did so, and he caught my grand-
mother in his arms, and kissed her for
dear life, I too coming in for my share.
For at least five minutes my grandmo-
ther and I tasted all the joy of our beau-
tiful act of seif-abuegation, and during
that time my grandfather made himself
sure of something that many times in
his life he had had to doubt. Now, both
by word and by look, my grandmother
gave him the assurance of her affection.
	And now, he said at last, now it
is my turn to make a confession. Old
Shuttlecock is no more down with AsP
atic cholera than I am. The Board of
Health is all a lot of jackasses, who
dont know when a man has had too
much watermelo~n.
	At this turn of affairs, which was
truly a let-down for everybody but old
Shuttlecock himself, who was blissfully
sleeping off the effects of cherry bounce,
my grandmother began to grow hysteri-
cal.

getting late; we must go home. I am</PB>

REMINISCENCES OF AN ASTRONOMER.

I.

	I MADE my first trip abroad when the
oldest transatlantic line was still the fash-
ionable one; and when the passenger
felt himself amply compensated for poor
attendance, coarse food, and bad coffee
by learning from the officers on the pro-
menade deck how far the ships of the
Cunard line were superior to all others
in strength of hull, ability of captain,
and discipline of crew. One day a ship
of the North German Lloyd line was
seen in the offing slowly gaining on us.
A passenger called the captains atten-
tion to the fact that we were being left
behind. Oh, they re very lightly
built, them German ships; built to car-
ry German dolls and such like cargo.
Needless to say, the speaker was not Sir
James Anderson, who won knighthood
by the part he took in laying the Atlan-
tic cable, but he was as perfect a type
of the old-fashioned captain of the best
class as I ever saw. His face looked as
if the gentlest zephyr that had ever
fanned it was an Atlantic hurricane, and
yet beamed with Hibernian good humor
and friendliness. He read prayers so
well on Sunday that a passenger assured
him he was born to he a bishop. Only
those readers who never sailed with Cap-
tain McMickan will need to be told his
name.
	In London one of the first men we met
was Thomas Hughes, of Rugby fame,
who made us feel how worthy he was of
the love and esteem bestowed upon him
by Americans. He was able to make our
visit pleasant in more ways than one.
Among the men I wanted to see was Mr.
John Stuart Mill, to whom I was attract-
ed not only by his fame as a philosopher
and the interest with which I had read
his books, hut also because he was the
author of an excellent pamphlet on the
Union side during our civil war.
	On expressing my desire to make Mr.
Mills acquaintance Mr. Hughes imme-
diately offered to give mc a note of in-
troduction. Mill lived at Blackheath,
which, although in an easterly direction
down the Thames, is one of the prettiest
suburbs of the great metropolis. His
dwelling was a very modest one, entered
through a passage of trellis-work in a
little garden. He was by no means the
grave and distinguished-looking man I</PB>

had expected to see. He was small in
stature and rather spare, and did not
seem to have markedly intellectual fea-
tures. The cordiality of his greeting was
more than I could have expected; and he
was much pleased to know that his work
in moulding English sentiment in our
favor at the commencement of the civil
war was so well remembered and so
highly appreciated across the Atlantic.
	As a philosopher, it must be conceded
that Mr. Mill lived at an unfortunate
time. While his vigor and independ-
ence of thought led him to break loose
from the trammels of the traditional phi-
losophy, modern scientific generalization
had not yet reached a stage favorable to
his becoming a leader in developing the
new philosophy. Still, whatever may be
the merits of his philosophic theories, it
must be conceded that no work on scien-
tific method has yet appeared worthy to
displace his System of Logic.
	A feature of London life that must
strongly impress the scientific student
from our country is the closeness of
touch, socially as well as officially, be-
tween the literary and scientific classes
on the one side and the governing classes
on the other. Mr. Hughes invited us to
make an evening call with him at the
house of a cabinet minister,  I think
it was Mr. Goschen,  where we should
find a number of persons worth seeing.
Among those gathered in this casual way
were Mr. Gladstone, Dean Stanley, and
our General Burnside, then grown quite
gray. I had never before met General
Burnside, but his published portraits
were so characteristic that the man could
scarcely have been mistaken. The only
change was in the color of his beard.
Then and later I found that a pleasant
feature of these informal at homes,
so universal in London, is that one meets
so many people he wants to see, and so
few he does not want to see.
	Ostensibly, the principal object of my
journey was the observation of a total
eclipse of the sun which was to be visi
ble in the Mediterranean, in December,
1870. Of another vastly more important
object I shall speak subsequently. In
view of the interest then attaching 1~o to-
tal eclipses of the sun, Congress had made
a very liberal appropriation for observa-
tions, to be expended under the direc-
tion of Professor Peirce, superintendent
of the Coast Survey. Peirce went over
in person to take charge of the arrange-
ments. He arrived in London with sev-
eral members of his party a few days
before we did, and about the same time
came an independent party of my fel-
low astronomers from the Naval Obser-
vatory, consisting of Professors Hall,
Harkness, and Eastman. The invasion
of their country by such an army of
American astronomers quite stirred up
our English colleagues, who sorrowfully
contrasted the liberality of our govern-
ment with the parsimony of their own,
which had, they said, declined to make
any provision for the observations of the
eclipse. Considering that it was visible
on their own side of the Atlantic, they
thought their government might take a
lesson from ours. Of course we could
not help them directly; and yet I sus-
pect that our coming, or at least the com-
ing of Peirce, really did help them a
great deal. At any rate, it was a curi-
ous coincidence that no sooner did the
American invasion occur than it was
semi-officially discovered that no applica-
tion of which her Majestys government
could take cognizance had been made by
the scientific authorities for a grant of
money with which to make preparations
for observing the eclipse. That the sci-
entific authorities were not long in catch-
ing so broad a hint as this goes without
saying. A little more of the story came
out a few days later in a very unexpect-
ed way.
	In scientific England, the great social
event of the year is the annual banquet
of the Royal Society, held on St. An-
drews day, the date of the annual meet-
ing of the society, and of the award of</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00252" SEQ="0252" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="246">246

its medals for distinguished work in sci-
ence. At the banquet, the scientific out-
look is discussed not only by members
of the society, but by men high in polit-
ical and social life. The medalists are
toasted, if they are present; and their
praises are sung, if, as is apt to be the
case with foreigners, they are absent.
First in rank is the Copley medal, found-
ed by Sir Godfrey Copley, a contempo-
rary of Newton. This medal has been
awarded annually since 1731, and is now
considered the highest honor that scien-
tific England has to bestow. The recip-
ient is selected with entire impartiality
as to country, not for any special work
published during the year, but in view
of the general merit of all that he has
done. Four times in its history the
medal has crossed the Atlantic. The
first three among us to receive it were
Franklin in 1753, Agassiz in 1861, and
Dana in 1877.1 The long time that
elapsed between the first and the second
of these awards affords an illustration of
the backwardness of scientific research
in America during the greater part of
the first century of our independence.
The year of my visit the medal was
awarded to Mr. Joule, the English physi-
cist, for his work on the relation of heat
and energy.
	I was a guest at the banquet, which
was the most brilliant function I had
witnessed up to that time. The leaders
in English science and learning sat
around the table. Her Majestys gov-
ernment was represented by Mr. Glad-
stone, the Premier, and Mr. Lowe, af-
terward Viscount Sherbrookc, Chancel-
lor of the Exchequer. Both replied to
toasts. Mr. Lowe as a speaker was per-
haps a little dull, but not so Mr. Glad-
stone. There was a charm about the
way in which his talk seemed to display
the inner man. It could not be said
that be had either the dry humor of Mr.

	Evarts or the wit of Mr. Depew; but
these qualities were well replaced by the
vivacity of his manner and the intellectu-
ality of his face. He looked as if he
had something interesting he wanted to
tell you; and he proceeded to tell it in
a very felicitous way as regarded both
manner and language, but without any-
thing that savored of eloquence. He
was like Carl Schurz in talking as if he
wanted to inform you, and not because
he wanted you to see what a fine speak-
er he was. With this he impressed one
as having a perfect command of his sub-
ject in all its bearings.
	I did not for a moment suppose that
the Premier of England could have
taken any personal interest in the mat-
ter of the eclipse. Great, therefore, was
my surprise when, in speaking of the
relations of the government to science,
he began to talk about the coming event.
I quote a passage from memory, after
twenty-seven years: I had the pleasure
of a visit, a few days since, from a very
distinguished American professor, Pro-
fessor Peirce of Harvard. In the course
of the interview, the learned gentleman
expressed his regret that her Majestys
government had declined to take any
measures to promote observations of the
coming eclipse of the sun by British as-
tronomers. I replied that I was not
aware that the government had declined
to take such measures. Indeed, I went
farther, and assured him that any appli-
cation from our astronomers for aid in
making these observations would receive
respectful consideration. I felt that
there might be room for some suspicion
that this visit of Professor Peirce was a
not unimportant factor in the changed
position of affairs as regarded British
observations of the eclipse.
	Not only the scene I have described,
but subsequent experience, has impressed
me with the high appreciation in which
the best scientific work is held by the
leading countries of Europe, especially
England and France, as if its prosecu</PB>

tion were something of national impor-
tance which men of the highest rank
thought it an honor totake part in. A phy-
sicist like Sir William Thomson becomes
a peer; a hereditary peer like Rayleigh
devotes his life and talents to scientific
investigation, becomes a university pro-
fessor, and makes researches leading to
the discovery of a new chemical element
in the atmosphere. The Marquis of
Salisbury, in an interval between two
terms of service as Premier of England,
presides over the British Association for
the Advancement of Science, and de-
livers an address showing a wide and
careful study of the generalizations of
modern science. Nor is this intimate
relation between intellectual and political
work confined to the governing classes.
An Englishman may get into Parliament
by being an historian, a chemist, or an
author, as readily as by being a party
manager or a lawyer.
	More than one American working in
a field removed from the public eye
may have had some reason to feel that
his efforts were more highly appreciat-
ed abroad than at home. Mr. George
W. Hill, who has made the little post-
office of Nyack Turnpike known to math-
ematicians and astronomers the world
over, is a very modest man. One of
the hardest wrestles I ever had with an
official superior was in trying to get a
Secretary of the Navy to raise his sala-
ry to fourteen hundred dollars. A few
years later he was one of a procession of
distinguished men, headed by the Duke
of Edinburgh, who received the degree
of Doctor of Laws from the University of
Cambridge. In France, also, one great
glory of the nation is felt to be the works
of its scientific and learned men of the
past and present. Membership of one
of the five academies of the Institute of
France is counted among the highest
honors to which a Frenchman can as-
pire. Most remarkable, too, is the ex-
tent to which other considerations than
that of merit are set aside in selecting
candidates for this honor. Quite recent-
ly a man was elected a member of the
Academy of Sciences who was without
either university or official position, and
earned a modest subsistence as a collab-
orator of the Revue des Deux Mondes.
But he had found time to make investiga-
tions in mathematical astronomy of such
merit that he was considered to have
fairly earned this distinction, and the
modesty of his social position did not lie
in his way.
	In England, the career of Professor
Cayley affords an example of the spirit
that impels a scientific worker of the
highest class, and of the extent to which
an enlightened community may honor
him for what he is doing. One of the
creators of modern mathematics, he
never had any ambition beyond the pro-
secution of his favorite science. I first
met him at a dinner of the Astronomical
Society Club. As the guests were tak-
ing off their wraps and assembling in
the anteroom, I noticed with some sur-
prise that one whom I supposed to be an
attendant was talking with them on easy
terms. A moment later the supposed
attendant was introduced as Professor
Cayley. His garb set off the seeming
haggardness of his keen features so
effectively that I thought him either
broken down in health or just recovering
from some protracted illness. The un-
spoken words on my lips were, Why
Professor Cayley, what has happened to
you? Being now in the confessional,
I must own that I did not, at the mo-
ment, recognize the marked intellectu-
ality of a very striking face. As a re-
presentation of a mathematician in the
throes of thought, I know nothing to
equal his portrait by Dickenson, which
now hangs in the hail of Trinity College,
Cambridge, and is reproduced in the
sixth volume of Cayleys collected works.
His life was that of a man moved to in-
vestigation by an uncontrollable impulse;
the only sort of man whose work is de-
stined to be imperishable. Until forty</PB>

years of age he was by profession a con-
veynacer. His ability was such that he
might have gained a fortune by practi-
cing the highest branch of English law, if
his energies had not been diverted in an-
other direction. The spirit in which he
pursued his work may be judged from
an anecdote related by his friend and
co-worker, Sylvester, who, in speaking of
Cayleys even and placid temper, told
me that he had never seen him ruffled
but once. Entering his office one morn-
ing, intent on some new mathematical
thought which he was discussing with
Sylvester, he opened the letter-box in his
door and found a bundle of papers relat-
ing to a law case which he was asked to
take up. The interruption was too much.
He flung the papers on the table with
remarks more forcible than complimen-
tary concerning the person who had dis-
tracted his attention at such an inoppor-
tune moment. In 1863 he was made
a professor at Cambridge, where, no
longer troubled with the intricacies of
land-tenure, he published one investiga-
tion after another with ceaseless activ-
ity, to the end of his life.
	Among my most interesting callers
was Professor John C. Adams, celebrat-
ed as sharing with Leverrier the honor
of having computed the position of the
planet Neptune before its existence was
otherwise known. The work of the
two men was prosecuted at almost the
same time; perhaps Adams was a little
earlier in the field; but by an unfortu-
nate chain of circumstances the work of
the Frenchman was the first to attract
public notice, and it was through Lever-
rier s initiative that the planet was
discovered with the Berlin telescope.
Adopting the principle that priority of
publication should be the sole basis of
credit, Arago had declared that no other
name than that of Leverrier should even
be mentioned in connection with the
work. If repute was correct, Leverrier
was not distinguished for those amiable
qualities that commonly mark the man
of science and learning. His attitude
toward Adams had always been hostile.
Under these conditions chance afforded
the latter a splendid opportunity of show-
ing his superiority to all personal feel-
ing. He was president of the Royal
Astronomical Society when its annual
medal was awarded to his French rival
for his work in constructing new tables
of the sun and planets. As such it was
his duty to deliver the address setting
forth the reasons for the award. He did
this with a warmth of praise for Lever-
riers works which could not have been
exceeded had the two men been bosom
friends.
	Adamss intellect was one of the keen-
est I ever knew. The most difficult
problems of mathematical astronomy
and the most recondite principles that
underlie the theory of the celestial mo-
tions were to him but childs play. His
works place him among the first mathe-
matical astronomers of the age, and yet
they do not seem to do his ability entire
justice. Indeed, for fifteen years previ-
ous to the time of my visit his published
writings had been rather meagre. I
asked a friend how it was that the pub-
lished works of so able a man had not
been more complete. The fact is,
said he, Adams is rather a lazy sort
of fellow who loves good dinners and
bad puns. I saw a great deal of him
subsequently, and, while I always found
him good-humored and cheerful, thought
our friends characterization was a little
overdrawn. But I believe he was justly
credited with an elaborate witticism to
the following effect: In view of the
fact that the only human being ever
known to have been killed by a meteor-
ite was a monk, we may concede that
after four hundred years the Popes bull
against the comet has been justified by
the discovery that comets are made up
of meteorites.
	Those readers who know on what im-
perfect data mens impressions are some-
times founded will not be surprised to</PB>

learn of my impression that an English-
mans politics could be inferred from
his mental and social make-up. As all
men are said to be born either Aristo-
telians or Platonists, so I supposed that
all Englishmen were born Conservatives
or Liberals.
	The utterances of English journalists
of the Conservative party about Ameri-
can affairs during and after our civil
war had not impressed me with the
idea that one so unfortunate as to be
born for that party would either take
much interest in meeting an American
or be capable of taking an appreciative
view of scientific progress. So confi-
dent was I of my theory that I remarked
to a friend, with whom I had become
somewhat intimate, that no one who
knew Mr. Adams could have much
doubt that he was a Liberal in politics.
	An embarrassed smile spread over the
friends features. You would not make
that conclusion known to Mr. Adams,
I hope, said he.
	But is he not a Liberal ?
	He is not only a Conservative, but
declares himself a Tory of the Tories.
	I afterward found that he fully justi-
fied his own description. At the univer-
sity, he was one of the leading opponents
of those measures which freed the aca-
demic degrees from religious tests. He
had even gone so far as to object to Syl-
vester receiving his degree, this being on
religious rather than on political grounds.
But extreme conservatism in religion
naturally leads to the same attitude in
politics.
	I had decided to observe the eclipse
at Gibraltar. In order that my results,
if I obtained any, might be utilized in
the best way, it was necessary that the
longitude of the station should be de-
termined by telegraph. This had never
been done for Gibraltar. How great
the error of the supposed longitude
might have been may be inferred from
the fact that a few years later an
American found the longitude of Lis
bon on the Admiralty charts to be two
miles in error. The first arrangements
I had to make in England were direct-
ed to this end. Considering the relation
of the worlds great fortress to British
maritime supremacy, it does seem as if
there were something presumptuous in
the coolness with which I went among
the authorities to make arrangements
for the enterprise. Nevertheless, the
authorities permitted the work, with a
cordiality which was of itself quite suffi-
cient to remove any such impression, had
it been entertained. The astronomers
did, indeed, profess to feel it humiliating
that the longitude of such a place as
Gibraltar should have to be determined
from Greenwich by an American. They
did not say by a foreigner, because
they always protested against Ameri-
cans looking upon themselves as such.
Still, it would not be an English enter-
prise if an American carried it out. I
suspect, however, that my proceedings
were not looked upon with entire dissat-
isfaction even by the astronomers. They
might prove as good a stimulant to their
government in showing a little more en-
terprise in that direction as the arrival
of our eclipse party did.
	The longitude work naturally took
me to the Royal Observatory which has
made the little town of Greenwich so f a-
mous. It is situated some eight miles
east from Charing Cross, on a hill in
Greenwich Park, with a pleasant out-
look toward the Thames. From my
youth up I had been working with its ob-
servations, and there was no institution
in the world which I had approached, or
could approach, with the interest I felt
in ascending the little hill on which the
observatory is situated. When the Cala-
bria was once free from her wharf in
New York harbor, and on her way down
the Narrows, the foremost thought was,
Off for Europe; we shall see Green-
wich! The day of my arrival in Lon-
don I had written to Professor Airy,
and received an answer the same even-</PB>

ing, inviting us to visit the observatory
and spend an afternoon with him a day
or two later.
	I was shown around the observatory
by an assistant, while my wife was en-
tertained by Mrs. Airy and the daugh-
ters inside the dwelling. The family
dined as soon as the days work was
over, about the middle of the afternoon.
After the meal, we sat over a blazing
fire and discussed our impressions of
London.
	What place in London interested
you most?
	The first place I went to see was
Cavendish Square.
	What was there in Cavendish Square
to interest you?
	When I was a little girl, my mother
once gave me, as a birthday present, a
small volume of poems. The first verse
in the book was : 
Little Ann and her mother were walking
one day
	Through Londons wide city so fair;
And business obliged them to go by the
way
That led them through Cavendish
Square.

	To our astonishment the astronomer
royal at once took up the thread: 
And as they passed by the great house of a
lord
A beautiful chariot there came,
To take some most elegant ladies abroad,
Who straightway got into the same,~~~

and went on to the end. I do not know
which of the two was more surprised:
Airy, to find an American woman who
was interested in bis favorite ballad, or
she to find that he could repeat it by
heart. The incident was the commence-
ment of a family friendship which has
outlived both the heads of the Airy
family.
	We may look back on Airy as the
most commanding figure in the astro-
nomy of our time. He owes this position
not only to his early works in mathe-
matical astronomy, but also to his ability
as an organizer. Before his time the
working force of an observatory general-
ly consisted~ of individual observers, each
of whom worked to a greater or less
extent in his own way. It is true that
organization was not unknown in such
institutions. Nominally, at least, the as-
sistants in a national observatory were
supposed to follow the instructions of a
directing head. This was especially the
case at Greenwich. Still, great depend-
ence was placed upon the judgment and
ability of the observer himself, who was
generally expected to be a man well
trained in his specialty, and able to car-
ry on good work without much help.
From Airys point of view, it was seen
that a large part of the work necessary
to the attainnient of the traditional end
of the Royal Observatory was of a kind
that almost any bright schoolboy could
learn to do in a few weeks, and that in
most of the remaining part plodding in-
dustry, properly directed, was more im-
portant than scientific training. He could
himself work out all the mathematical
formula, and write all the instructions
required to keep a small army of ob-
servers and computers employed, and
could then train in his methods a few
able lieutenants, who would see that all
the details were properly executed. Un-
der these lieutenants was a grade com-
prising men of sufficient technical educa-
tion to enable them to learn how to point
the telescope, record a transit, and per-
form the other technical operations ne-
cessary in an astronomical observation.
A third grade was that of computers:
ingenious youth, quick at figures, ready
to work for a compensation which an
American laborer would despise, yet well
enough schooled to make simple calcula-
tions. Under the new system they need-
ed to understand only the four rules of
arithmetic; indeed, so far as possible
Airy arranged his calculations in such a
way that subtraction and division were
rarely required. His boys had little
more to do than add and multiply. Thus,</PB>

so far as the doing of work was con-
cerned, he introduced the same sort of
improvement that our times have wit-
nessed in great manufacturing establish-
ments, where labor is so organized that
unskilled men bring about results that
formerly demanded a high grade of tech-
nical ability. He introduced production
on a large scale into astronomy-
	At the time of my visit, it was much
the fashion among astronomers else-
where to speak slightingly of the Green-
wich system. The objections to it were,
in substance, the same that have been
made to the ~ninute subdivision of labor.
The intellect of the individual was stunt-
ed for the benefit of the work. The as-
tronomer became a mere operative. Yet
it must be admitted that the astronoin-
ical work done at Greenwich during the
sixty years since Airy introduced his
system has a value and an importance in
its specialty that none done elsewhere
can exceed. All future conclusions as
to the laws of motion of the heavenly
bodies must depend largely upon it.
	The organization of his little army
necessarily involved a corresponding
change in the instruments they were to
use. Before his time the trained astro-
nomer worked with instruments of very
delicate construction, so that skill in
handling them was one of the requisites
of an observer. Airy made them in the
likeness of heavy machinery, which could
suffer no injury from a blow of the head
of a careless observer. Strong and sim-
ple, they rarely got out of order. It is
said that an assistant who showed a
visiting astronomer the transit circle
sometimes hit it a good slap to show how
solid it was; but this was not done on
the present occasion. The little army
had its weekly marching orders and
made daily reports of progress to its
commander, who was thus enabled to
control the minutest detail of every
movement.
	In the course of the evening Airy
gave me a lesson in method, which was
equally instructive and entertaining. In
order to determine the longitude of Gib-
raltar, it was necessary that time signals
should be sent by telegraph from the
Royal Observatory. Our conversation
naturally led us into a discussion of the
general subject of such operations. I
told him of the difficulties we had ex-
perienced in determining a telegraphic,
longitude,  that of the Harvard Obser-
vatory from Washington, for example,
 because it was only after a great deal
of talking and arranging on the evening
of the observation that the various tele-
graph stations between the two points
could have their connections successfully
made at the same moment. At the ap-
pointed hour the Washington operator
would be talking with the others, to know
if they were ready, and so a general dis-
cussion about the arrangements might
go on for half an hour before the con-
nections were all reported good. If we
had such trouble in a land line, how
should we get a connection from London
to the Gibraltar cable through lines in
constant use?
	But, said Airy, I never allow an
operator who can speak with the instru-
ments to take part in determining a tele-
graphic longitude.
	Then how can you get the connec-
tions all made from one end of the line
to the other, at the same moment, if
your operators cannot talk to one an-
other?
	Nothing is simpler. I set a moment,
say eight oclock Greenwich mean time,
at which signals are to commence. Every
intermediate office through which the
signals are to pass is instructed to have
its wires connected in both directions
exactly at the given hour, and to leave
them so connected for ten minutes, with-
out asking any further instructions. At
the end of the line the instruments must
be prepared at the appointed hour to re-
ceive the signals. All I have to do here
is to place my clock in the circuit and
send on the signals for ten minutes, coin-</PB>

mencing at eight oclock. They are re-
corded at the other end of the line, with-
out further trouble.
	But have you never met with a fail-
ure to understand the instructions?
	No; they are too simple to be mis-
taken, once it is understood that no one
has anything to do but make his connec-
tions at the designated moment, without
asking whether any one else is ready.
	Airy was noted not less for his ability
as an organizer than for his methodical
habits. The care with which he pre-
served every record led Sir William
iRowan Hamilton to say that when Airy
wiped his pen on a blotter, he fancied
him as always taking a press copy of
the mark. His machinery seemed to
work perfectly, whether it was construct-
ed of flesh or of brass. He could prepare
instructions for the most complicated
piece of work with such thorough pro-
vision against every accident and such
completeness in every detail that the
work would go on for years without fur-
ther serious attention from him. The
instruments which he designed half a
century ago are mostly in use to this
day, with scarcely an alteration.
	Yet there is some reason to fear that
Airy carried system a little too far to get
the best results. Of late years his system
has been greatly changed, even at Green-
wich. It was always questionable whe-
ther so rigid a military routine could
accomplish the best that was possible in
astronomy; and Airy himself, during his
later years, modified his plan by trying
to secure trained scientific men as his as-
sistants, giving them liberty to combine
independent research, on their own ac-
count, with the work of the establish-
ment. His successor has gone farther in
the same direction, and is now gathering
around him a corps of young university
men, from whose ability much may be
expected. Observations with the spec-
troscope have been pursued, and the ob-
servatory has taken a prominent part in
the international work of making a pho
tographic map of the heavens. Of spe-
cial importance are the regular discus-
sions of photographs of the sun, taken in
order to determine the law of the varia-
tion of the spots. The advantage of the
regular system which has been followed
for more than fifty years is seen in the
meteorological observations; these dis-
prove some theories of the relation be-
tween the sun and the weather, in a way
that no other set of meteorological re-
cords has done. While delicate deter-
minations of the highest precision, such
as those made at Pulkova, are not yet
undertaken to any great extent, a regular
even if slow improvement is going on in
the general character of the observations
and researches, which must bear fruit in
due time.
	One of the curious facts we learned
at Greenwich was that astronomy was
still supposed to be astrology by many
in England. That a belief in astrology
should survive was perhaps not remark-
able, though I do not remember to have
seen any evidence of it in this country.
But applications received at the Royal
Observatory, from time to time, showed a
widespread belief among the masses that
one of the functions of the astronomer
royal was the casting of horoscopes.
	We went to Edinburgh. Our first visit
was to the observatory, then under the
direction of Professor C. Piazzi Smyth,
who was also an Egyptologist of repute,
having made careful measurements of
the Pyramids, and brought out some
new facts regarding their construction.
He was thus led to the conclusion that
they bore marks of having been built
by a people of more advanced civiliza-
tion than was generally supposed,  so
advanced, indeed, that we had not yet
caught up to them in scientific investi-
gation. These views were set forth with
great fullness in his work on The An-
tiquity of Intellectual Man, as well as in
other volumes describing his researches.
He maintained that the builders of the
Pyramids knew the distance of the sun</PB>

rather better than we did, and that the
height of the great Pyramid had been so
arranged that if it was multiplied by a
thousand millions we should get this dis-
tance more exactly than we could mea-
sure it in these degenerate days. With
him, to believe in the Pyramid was to
believe this, and a great deal more about
the civilization which it proved. So,
when he asked me whether I believed
in the Pyramid, I told him that I did not
think I would depend wholly upon the
Pyramid for the distance of the sun to
be used in astronomy, but should want its
indications at least confirmed by modern
researches. The hint was sufficient, and
I was not further pressed for views on
this subject.
	He introduced us to Lady Hamilton,
widow of the celebrated philosopher,
who still held court at Edinburgh. The
daughter of the family was in repute as
a metaphysician. This was interesting,
because I had never before heard of
a female metaphysician, although there
were several cases of female mathemati-
cians recorded in history. First among
them was Donna Maria Agnesi, who
wrote one of the best eighteenth-century
books on the calculus, and had a special
dispensation from the Pope to teach
253
mathematics at Bologna. We were
therefore very glad to accept an invita-
tion from Lady Hamilton to spend an
evening with a few of her friends. Her
rooms were fairly filled with books, the
legacy of one of whom it was said that
not a thought had come down to us
through the ages which he had not mas-
tered and made his own. The few
guests were mostly university people and
philosophers. rrhe most interesting of
them was Professor Blackie, the Gre-
cian scholar, who was the liveliest little
man of sixty I ever saw; amusing us
by singing German songs, and dancing
about the room like a sprightly child
among its playmates. I talked with Miss
Hamilton about Mill, whose Examina-
tion of Sir William Hamiltons Philoso-
phy was still fresh in mens minds. Of
course she did not believe in this book,
and said that Mill could not understand
her fathers philosophy. With all her
intellect, she was a fine healthy-looking
young lady, and it was a sad surprise,
a few years later, to hear of her death.
Madame Sophie Kovalevsky afterward
appeared on the stage as the first female
mathematician of our time, but it may
be feared that the woman philosopher
died with Miss Hamilton.

EDWARD BELLAMY.

	THE first book of Edward Bellamys
which I read was Dr. Heidenhoffs Pro-
cess, and I thought it one of the finest
feats in the region of romance which I
had known. It seemed to me all the
greater because the authors imagination
wrought in it on the level of average
life, and built the fabric of its dream
out of common clay. The simple peo-
ple and their circumstance were treated
as if they were persons whose pathetic
story he had witnessed himself, and he
was merely telling it. He wove into
the texture of their sufferings and their
sorrows the magic thread of invention so
aptly and skillfully that the reader felt
nothing improbable in it. One even felt
a sort of moral necessity for it, as if such
a clue not only could be, but must be
given for their escape. It became not
merely probable, but imperative, that
there should be some means of extir-
pating the memory which fixed a sin
in lasting remorse, and of thus saving</PB>

the soul from the depravity of despair.
When it finally appeared that there was
no such means, one reader, at least, was
inconsolable. Nothing from romance
remains to me more poignant than the
pang that this plain, sad tale imparted.
	The art employed to accomplish its
effect was the art which Bellamy had in
degree so singular that one might call it
supremely his. He does not so much
transmute our every-day reality to the
substance of romance as make the airy
stuff of dreams one in quality with veri-
table experience. Every one remembers
from Looking Backward the allegory
which figures the pitiless prosperity of
the present conditions as a coach drawn
by slaves under the lash of those on its
top, who have themselves no firm hold
upon their places, and sometimes fall,
and then, to save themselves from being
ground under the wheels, spring to join
the slaves at the traces. But it is not
this, vivid and terrible as it is, which
most wrings the heart; it is that moment
of anguish at the close, when Julian West
trembles with the nightmare fear that he
has been only dreaming of the just and
equal future, before he truly wakes and
finds that it is real. That is quite as it
would happen in life, and the power to
make the reader feel this like something
he has known himself is the distinctive
virtue of that imagination which revived
throughout Christendom the faith in a
millennium.
	A good deal has been said against
the material character of the happiness
which Wests story promises men when
they shall begin to do justice, and to
share equally in the fruits of the toil
which operates life; and I confess that
this did not attract me. I should have
preferred, if I had been chooser, to have
the millennium much simpler, much more
independent of modern inventions, mod-
ern conveniences, modern facilities. It
seemed to me that in an ideal condition
(the only condition finally worth having)
we should get on without most of these
things, which are but sorry patches on
the rags of our outworn civilization, or
only toys to amuse our greed and va-
cancy. 2Esthetically, I sympathized with
~those select spirits who were shocked
that nothing better than the futile lux-
ury of their own selfish lives could be
imagined for the lives which overwork
and underpay had forbidden all plea-
sures; I acquired considerable merit with
myself by asking whether the hope of
these formed the highest appeal to human
nature. But I overlooked an important
condition which the other critics over-
looked; I did not reflect that such things
were shown as merely added unto those
who had first sought the kingdom of God
and his righteousness, and that they were
no longer vicious or even so foolish when
they were harmlessly come by. I have
since had to own that the joys I thought
trivial and sordid did rightly, as they
did most strenuously, appeal to the lives
hitherto starved of them. In depicting
them as the common reward of the com-
mon endeavor Edward Bellamy huilded
better than we knew, whether he knew
better or not, and he builded from a
thorough sense of that level of humanity
which he was destined so potently to
influence,  that American level which
his book found in every Christian land.
	I am not sure whether this sense was
ever a full consciousness with him; very
possibly it was not; but in any case it
was the spring of all his work, from the
earliest to the latest. Somehow, whether
he knew or not, he unerringly felt how
the average man would feel; and all the
webs of fancy that he wove were essen-
tially of one texture through this sym-
pathy. His imagination was intensely
democratic, it was inalienably plebeian,
even,  that is to say, humane. It did
not seek distinction of expression; it
never put the simplest and plainest read-
er to shame by the assumption of those
fine-gentleman airs which abash and dis-
hearten more than the mere literary
swell can think. He would use a rhrase</PB>

or a word that was common to vulgari-
ty, if it said what he meant; sometimes
he sets ones teeth on edge, in his earlier
stories, by his public school diction. But
the nobility of the heart is never absent
from his work; and he has always the
distinction of self-forgetfulness in his art.
	I have been interested, in recurring to
his earlier work, to note how almost en-
tirely the action passes in the American
village atmosphere. It is like the greater
part of his own life in this. He was
not a man ignorant of other keeping.
He was partly educated abroad, and he
knew cities both in Europe and in Amer-
ica. He was a lawyer by profession,
and he was sometime editor of a daily
newspaper in a large town. But I re-
member how, in one of our meetings, he
spoke with distrust and dislike of the
environment of cities as unwholesome
and distracting, if not demoralizing
(very much to the effect of Tolstoys
philosophy in the matter), and in his
short stories his types are village types.
They are often such when he finds them
in the city, but for much the greater part
he finds them in the village; and they are
always, therefore, distinctively Amen-
can; for we are village people far more
than we are country people or city peo-
pIe. In this as in everything else we
are a medium race, and it was in his
sense, if not in his knowledge of this
fact, that Bellamy wrote so that there is
never a word or a look to the reader
implying that he and the writer are of a
different sort of folk from the people in
the story.
	Looking Backward, with its material
delights, its communized facilities and
luxuries, could not appeal to people on
lonely farms who scarcely knew of them,
or to people in cities who were tired of
them, so much as to that immense aver-
age of villagers, of small-town-dwellers,
who had read much and seen something
of them, and desired to have them. This
average, whose intelligence forms the
prosperity of our literature, and whose
virtue forms the strength of our nation,
is the environment which Bellamy rare-
ly travels out of in his airiest romance.
He has its curiosity, its principles, its
aspirations. He can tell what it wishes
to know, what problem will hold it, what
situation it can enter into, what mystery
will fascinate it, and what noble pain it
will bear. It is by far the widest field
of American fiction; most of our finest
artists work preferably in it, but he works
in it to different effect from any other.
He takes that life on its mystical side,
and deals with types rather than with
characters; for it is one of the prime
conditions of the romancer that he shall
do this. His people are less objectively
than subjectively present; their import
is greater in what happens to them than
in what they are. But he never falsifies
them or their circumstance. He ascer-
tains them with a fidelity that seems al-
most helpless, almost ignorant of differ-
ent people, different circumstance; you
would think at times that he had never
known, never seen, any others; but of
course this is only the effect of his art.
	When it comes to something else, how-
ever, it is still with the same fidelity
that he keeps to the small-town average,
the American average. He does not
address himself more intelligently to
the mystical side of this average in IDr.
Heidenhoffs Process, or Miss Luding-
tons Sister, or any of his briefer ro-
mances, than to its ethical side in Equal-
ity. That book disappointed me, to be
frank, I thought it artistically inferior
to anything else he had done. I thought
it was a mistake to have any story at all
in it, or not to have vastly more. I felt
that it was not enough to clothe the dry
bones of its sociology with paper gar-
ments out of Looking Backward. Except
for that one sublime moment when the
workers of all sorts cry to the Lords of
the Bread to take them and use them at
their own price, there was no thrill or
throb in the book. But I think now
that any believer in its economics may</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00262" SEQ="0262" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="256">256

be well content to let them take their
chance with the American average, here
and elsewhere, in the form that the au-
thor has given them. He felt that av-
erage so wittingly that he could not have
been wrong in approaching it with all
that public school exegesis which wea-
ries such dilettanti as myself.
	Our average is practical as well as
mystical; it is first the dust of the
earth, and then it is a living soul; it
likes great questions simply and famil-
iarly presented, before it puts its faith in
them and makes its faith a life. It likes
to start to heaven from home, and in all
this Bellamy was of it, voluntarily and
involuntarily. I recall how, when we
first met, he told me that he had come
to think of our hopeless conditions sud-
demily, one day, in looking at his own
children, and reflecting that he could not
place them beyond the chance of want by
any industry or forecast or providence;
and that the status meant the same im-
possibility for others which it meant for
him. I understood then that I was in
the presence of a man too single, too
sincere, to pretend that he had begun
by thinking of others, and I trusted him
the more for his confession of a selfish
premise. He never went back to him-
self in his endeavor, but when he had
once felt his power in the world, he de-
dicated his life to his work. He wore
himself out in thinking and feeling
about it, with a belief in the good time
to come that penetrated his whole be-
ing and animated his whole purpose, but
apparently with no manner of fanati-
cism. In fact, no one could see him, or
look into his quiet, gentle face, so full
of goodness, so full of common sense,
without perceiving that he had reasoned
to his hope for justice in the frame of
things. He was indeed a most practical,
Edward Bellamy.

	a most American man, without a touch
of sentimentalism in his humanity. He
believed that some now living should see
his dream  the dream of Plato, the
dream of the first Christians, the dream
of Bacon, the dream of More  come
true in a really civilized society; but
he had the patience and courage which
could support any delay.
	These qualities were equal to the suf-
fering and the death which came to
him in the midst of his work, and cut
him off from writing that one more book
with which every author hopes to round
his career. He suffered greatly, but he
bore his suffering greatly; and as for his
death, it is told that when, toward the
last, those who loved him were loath
to leave him at night alone, as he pre-
ferred to be left, he asked, What can
happen to me? I can only die.
	I am glad that he lived to die at
home in Chicopee,  in the village en-
vironment by which he interpreted the
heart of the American nation, and knew
how to move it more than any other
American author who has lived. The
theory of those who think differently is
that he simply moved the popular fancy;
and this may suffice to explain the state
of some people, but it will not account
for the love and honor in which his
name is passionately held by the vast
average, East and West. His fame is
safe with them, and his faith is an ani-
mating force concerning whose effect at
this time or some other time it would not
be wise to prophesy. Whether his ethics
will keep his ~sthetics in remembrance
I do not know; but I am sure that one
cannot acquaint ones self with his merely
artistic work, and not be sensible that
in Edward Bellamy we were rich in a
romantic imagination surpassed only by
that of Hawthorne.

AT NATURAL BRIDGE, VIRGINIA.

II.

	M~ enjoyment of the country about
the Bridge may be said to have begun
with my settling down for a more leisure-
ly stay. Hurry and discontent are poor
helps to appreciation. That afternoon,
the morning having been devoted to or-
nithological excitements, I strolled over
to Mount Jefferson, and spent an hour in
the observatory, where a delicious breeze
was blowing. The mountain proved
to be nothing more than a round grassy
hilltop,  the highest point in a sheep-
pasture,  but it offered, nevertheless,
a wide and charming prospect: moun-
tains near and far, a world of green hills,

AT NATURAL BRIDGE, VIRGINIA.

II.

	M~ enjoyment of the country about
the Bridge may be said to have begun
with my settling down for a more leisure-
ly stay. Hurry and discontent are poor
helps to appreciation. That afternoon,
the morning having been devoted to or-
nithological excitements, I strolled over
to Mount Jefferson, and spent an hour in
the observatory, where a delicious breeze
was blowing. The mountain proved
to be nothing more than a round grassy
hilltop,  the highest point in a sheep-
pasture,  but it offered, nevertheless,
a wide and charming prospect: moun-
tains near and far, a world of green hills,
with here and there a level stretch, most
restful to the eye, of the James River val-
ley,  the great Valley of Virginia. Up
from the surrounding field came the tin-
kle of sheep-bells, and down in one cor-
ner of it young men were slowly gather-
ing, some in wagons, some on horseback,
for a game of ball. There was to be a
match that  evening, I had been
told, between the Bridge nine (I am sorry
not to remember its name) and the Buena
Vistas. It turned out, however, so I
learned the next day, that a supposed case
of smallpox at Buena Vista had made
such an interchange of athletic courtesies
inexpedient for the time being, and the

with a trial of skill among themselves,
for which they chose up ( picked off )
after the usual fashion, the two leaders

pealed to him in a measure, and he con-
fessed that he wished he were a botanist.
He was always very fond of flowers.
His side had been victorious in the ball

Some of the players must have come
from a considerable distance, it seemed
to me, as there was no sign of a village
or even of a hamlet, so far as I had dis-
covered, anywhere in the neighborhood.
The Bridge is not in any township, but
simply in Rockbridge County, after a
Virginia custom quite foreign to all a
New Englanders notions of geographi-
cal propriety.
	The prospect from Mount Jefferson
was beautiful, as I have said, but on my
return I happened upon one that pleased
me better. I had been down through
Cedar Creek ravine, and had taken my
own way out, up the right-hand slope
through the woods, noting the flowers as

hills beyond. And now, as I continued
to look, the particulars fell into place, 
dropping in a sense out of sight,  and
the scene became one. By and by the
light increased upon the broad precipitous
face of the mountain, softness and beauty
inexpressible, while the remainder of the
landscape lay in deep shadow.
	I fell to wondering, at last, what it is
that constitutes the peculiar attractive-
ness of a limited view  limited in
breadth, not in depth  as compared
with a panorama of half the horizon.
The only answer I gave myself was that,
for the supreme enjoyment of beauty, the
eye must be at rest, satisfied, with no
temptation to wander. We are finite
creatures with infinite desires. The sight
must go far,  to the rim of the world,
or to some grand interposing object so
remote as to be of itself a natural and
satisfying limit of vision; and the eye
must be held to that point, not by a dis-
tracting exercise of the will, but by the
quieting constraint of circumstances.
	Let my theorizing be true or false,
I greatly enjoyed the picture; the deep,
dark, wooded ravine, with the line of
water running through it lengthwise, the
magnificent stone arch, the low hills in
the middle distance, and Thunder Moun-
tain a background for the whole. The
mountain, as has been said, was a long
ridge, not a peak; and sharp as it looked
from this point of view, it was very likely
fiat at the top. Like Lookout Mountain
and Waldens Ridge, it might, for any-
thing I knew, be roomy enough to hold
one or two Massachusetts counties upon
its summit. While I sat gazing at it the
sun went down and left it of a deep som-
bre blue. Then, of a sudden, a small
heron flew past, and a pileated wood-
pecker somewhere behind me set up a
prolonged and lusty shout; and a few
minutes later I was startled to see be-
tween me and the sunset sky a flock of
six big herons flying slowly in single file,
like so many pelicans. From their size
they should have been Ardea herodias,
but in that light there was no telling of
colors. It was a ghostly procession, so
silent and unexpected, worthy of the
place and of the hour. I was beginning
to feel at home. A wood thrush sang
for me as I continued my course to the
hotel, and my spirit sang with him. Im
glad I am alive, my pencil wrote of its
own accord at the end of the days jot-
tings.
	I woke the next morning to the lively
music of a whippoorwill,  the same, I
suppose, that had sung me to sleep the
evening before. He performed that ser-
vice faithfully as long as I remained at
the Bridge, and always to my unmixed
satisfaction. Whippoorwills are among
my best birds, and of recent years I have
had too little of them. Immediately
after breakfast I must go again to the
roadside wood, and then to Buck Hill, as
a dog must go again to bark under a
tree up which he has once driven a cat
or a squirrel. But there is no duplicat-
ing of experiences. The birds  the
flocks of travelers  were not there.
Chats were calling ceow, ceow, with the
true countrymans twang; and what was
much better, a Swainson thrush was
singing. Better still, a pair of blue yel-
low-backed warblers (the most abun-
dant representatives of the family thus
far) had begun the construction of a
nest in a black walnut tree, suspending
it from a rather large branch ( as big
as my thumb ) at a height of perhaps
twenty feet. It was little more than a
frame as yet, the light shining through
it everywhere; and the bird, perhaps be-
cause of my presence, seemed in no haste
about its completion. I saw her bring
what looked like a piece of lichen and
adjust it into place (though she carried
it elsewhere first  with wonderful sly-
ness !), but my patience gave out before
she came back with a second one.
	On Buck Hill, in the comparative ab-
sence of birds, I amused myself with a
dry land tarrapin, as my West Vir-
ginia acquaintance had called it (other</PB>

wise known as a box turtle), a creature
which I had seen several times in my
wanderings, and had asked him about;
a new species to me, of a peculiarly
humpbacked appearance, and curious
for its habit of shutting itself up in its
case when disturbed, the anterior third
of the lower shell being jointed for
that purpose. A phlegmatic customer, it
seemed to be; looking at me with dull,
unspeculative eyes, and sometimes re-
sponding to a pretty violent nudge with
only a partial closing of its lid. It is
very fond of may apples (mandrake), I
was told, and is really one of the fea-
tures of the dry hill woods. I ran
upon it continually.
	A lazy afternoon jaunt over a lonely
wood road, untried before, yielded little
of mentionable interest except the sight
of a blue grosbeak budding the upper
branches of a tree in the manner of a
purple finch or a rose-breast. I call
him a blue grosbeak, as I called him
at the time; but he went into my book
that evening with a damnatory question
mark attached to his name. He had
been rather far away and pretty high;
and the possibilities of error magnified
themselves on second thought, till I said
to myself, Well, he may have been an
indigo-bird, after all. Second thought
is the mother of uncertainty; and un-
certainties are poor things for a mans
comfort. The seasons were met here;
for even while I busied myself with the
blue grosbeak (as he pretty surely was,
for all my want of assurance) a crossbill
flew over with loud calls.
	In the same place I heard a tremen-
dous hammering a little on one side of
me, so vigorous a piece of work that I
was persuaded the workman could be
nobody but a pileated woodpecker. A
long time I stood with my gaze fas-
tened upon the tree from which the noise
seemed to come. Would the follow
never show himself? Yes, he put his
head out from behind a limb at last
(what a fiery crest!), saw me on the in~
stant, and was gone like a flash. Then
from a little distance he set up a re-
sounding halloo. This was only the sec-
ond time that birds of his kind had
been seen hereabout, but the voice had
been heard daily, and more than once I
had noticed what I could have no doubt
were nest-holes of their making. One
of these, on Buck Hill,  freshly cut, if
appearances went for anything,  I un-
dertook to play the spy upon; but if. the
nest was indeed in use the birds were
too wary for me, or I was very unfortu-
nate in my choice of hours. Time was
precious, and the secret seemed likely to
cost more than it would bring, with so
many other matters inviting my atten-
tion. INest or no nest, I was glad to be
within the frequent sound of that wild,
ringing, long-drawn shout, a true voice
of the wilderness; as if the Hebrew
prophecy were fulfilled, and the moun-
tains and the hills had found a tongue.
	It was not until the sixth day that I
went to Lincoln Heights, a place worth
all the rest of the countryside, I soon
came to think, with the single exception
of Cedar Creek ravine. A winding
wood road carried me thither (the dis-
tance may be two miles; but I have lit-
tle idea what it is, though I covered it
once or twice a day for the next four
days), and might have been made 
half made, just to my liking  for my
private convenience. I believe I never
met any one upon it, going or coming.
	The glory of the spot is its trees; but
with me, as things fell out, these took in
the order of time a second place. My
first admiration was not for them, ad-
mirable as they were, but for a few birds
in the tops of them. In short, at my
first approach to the Heights (there is
no thought of climbing, but only the
most gradual of ascents) I began to hear
from the branches overhead, now here,
now there, an occasional weak warblers
song that set my curiosity on edge. It
was not the parulas (blue yellow-backs),
but like it~ What should it be, then,</PB>

except the ceruleans? By and by I
caught a glimpse of a bird, clear white
below, with a dark line across the breast;
and yes, I saw what I was looking for, 
though the bird flew to another branch
the next moment,  black streaks along
the sides of the body. There were at
least eight or ten others like him in
the treetops; and it was a neck-break-
ing half-hour that I passed in watching
them, determined as I was to gain a
view not only of the under parts, but
of the back and wings. The labor and
difficulty of the search were increased
indefinitely by the confusing presence of
numerous other warbiers of various kinds
in the same lofty branches, making it
inevitable that many opera - glass shots
should be wasted. It is no help to a
mans equanimity at such a time to spend
a priceless three minutes  any one of
which may be the last  in getting the
glass upon a tiny thing that flits inces-
santly from one leafy twig to another,
only to find in the end that it is nothing
but a myrtle warbler; a pretty creature,
no doubt, but of no more consequence
just now than an English sparrow. To-
day, however, the birds favored me; no
untimely whim hurried them away to
another wood, and patience had its re-
ward. Little by little my purpose was
accomplished and my mind cleared of
all uncertainty. Then I took out my
pencil to characterize the song while it
was still in my ears, and still new.
Greatly like one of the more broken
forms of the parulas, I wrote, a bird
repeating it at that very instant by way
of confirmation. I can imagine a
fairly sharp ear being deceived by it, es-
pecially in a place like this, where pam-
las have been singing from morning till
night, until the listener has tired of them
and become listless. This sentence the
reader may keep in mind, if he will, to
glance back upon for his amusement in
the light of a subsequent experience
which it will be my duty to relate before
I am done with my story.
	Between the migratory transients
and the birds already at home, the place
was pretty full of wings. A Swainson
thrush sang, and from a bushy slope
came a nasal thrush voice that should
have been a veerys. I took chase at
once, and caught a glimpse of a reddish-
brown bird darting out of sight before
me. Do my best, I could find nothing
more of it. If it was a veery, as I
suppose, it was the only one I saw in
Virginia, where the species, from Dr.
Rivess account of the matter, seems to
be a rather uncommon migrant. Un-
happily, I could not bring my scientific
conscience to list it on so hurried a sight,
even with the note as corroborative tes-
timony. That, for aught I could posi-
tively assert, might have been a gray-
cheeks, while the reddish color might
with equal possibility have belonged to
a wood thrush, clear as it had seemed
at the moment that what I was looking
at was the back of the bird itself, and
not the back of its head. Doubt is cred-
ulous. All kinds of negatives are plau-
sible to it, and once it has adopted one it
will maintain it in the face of the five
senses.
	On the opposite side of the path, in
the bushy angles of a Virginia fence,
a hooded warbler showed himself, fur-
tive and silent,  my only Bridge spe-
cimen, to my great surprise; and near
him was a female black-throated blue,
a queer-looking body, like nothing in
particular, yet labeled past mistake,
which I can never see without a kind of
wonder. Among the treetop birds were
Blackbumnian warblers, black - throated
greens and blues, chestnut - sides, red-
starts, myrtle - birds, red - eyed and yel-
low - throated vireos, and indigo - birds.
Many white-throated sparrows still lin-
gered; singing flat, as usual,  the only
birds I know of that find it impossible
to hold the pitch. The defect has its
favorable side; it makes their concerts
amusing. I remember seeing a quiet
gentleman thrown into fits of uncontrol</PB>

lable laughter by the rehearsal of a
spring flock, bird after bird starting the
tune, and not one in ten of them keep-
ing its whistle true to the conclusion of
the measure. All these things,  though
they may seem not many,  with the
long rests and numerous side excursions
that went with them, consumed the morn-
ing hours before I knew it, so that I was
hardly at the end of the way before it
wa~ time to return for dinner.
	For the afternoon nothing was to be
thought of but another visit to the same
place,  the finest place I have seen
yet, and the finest walk. So I had
put down the mornings discovery. The
cerulean warbler I found spoken of by
Dr. Rives as accidental or very rare;
in the light of which entry the dozen or
so of specimens seen and heard during
the forenoon acquired a fresh interest.
	The second jaunt, because it was a
second one, could be taken more at lei-
sure; and as the birds gave me less
employment, my eyes were more upon
the trees. These, as I had felt before,
were a wonder and a comfort; it was a
benediction to walk under them, as if
one were within the precincts of a holy
place: oaks for the most part (of sev-
eral kinds), with black walnut, shagbark,
tulip, chestnut, and other species, set ir-
regularly, or rather left standing irregu-
larly, two or three deep, beside the road
on either hand; a royal upbill avenue,
which near the top became an open
grove. Except in Florida, I had never
seen a more magnificent growth. Some
of the trees had grapevines and Yirginia
creeper clinging about them. Up one
huge oak, with strange flaky bark, like a
shagbark trees (a white oak, neverthe-
less, to judge from its half-grown leaves),
a grapevine had mounted for a height
of forty feet, as I estimated the distance,
not making use of the bole, but of the
limbs, seeming to leap from one to an-
other, even when they were ten feet
apart. It must have been of the trees
age, I suppose, and had grown with its
growth. In the shadow of these giants,
yet not overshadowed by them, were
flowering dogwoods and redbuds. It is
a pretty habit these two have of grow-
ing side by side, as if they knew the
value of contrasted colors.
	At a point on the edge of the grove I
turned to enjoy the prospect southward:
niountains everywhere, with the more
pointed of the twin Peaks of Otter show-
ing between two oaks that barely gave
it room; all the mountains radiantly
beautiful, with cloud shadows flecking
their wooded slopes. INot a house was
in sight; but in one place beyond the
middle-distance hills a thin blue smoke
was rising. There, doubtless, lay the
valley of the James. Just before me,
on the left of the open field, stood a pe-
culiarly graceful dogwood, all in a glory
of white, one fan-shaped branch above
another,  a miracle of loveliness. The
eye that saw it was satisfied with see-
ing. Beyond it a chat played the clown
(knowing no better, even to-day), and a
rose-breast began warbling. It seemed a
tender story,  sweetness beyond words,
and happiness without a shadow. From
a second point, a little farther on, the
entire southern horizon came into view,
with both the Peaks of Otter visible; a
truly enchanting picture, the sky full of
sunlight and floating wbite clouds.
	In a treetop behind me a cerulean
warbler had been singing, but flew away
as I turned about. My only sight of him
was on the wing, a mere speck in the
air. Afterward a parula gave out his
tune, running the notes straight upward
and snapping them off at the end in
whiplash fashion, as much as to say,
Now see if you can tell tbe difference.
And then, just as I was ready to leave
the grove, stepping along a footpath
through a bramble patch, I descried al-
most at my feet a warbler,  a female
by her look and demeanor, and a stran-
ger; blue and white, with dark streak-
ings along the sides. I lost her soon;
but she had seemed to be looking for</PB>

nest materials, and of course I waited
for her to return. This she presently did,
and now I saw her strip bits of bark
from plant stems till she had her bill
full of short pieces. Carrying these, she
disappeared in a bramble and grape-
vine thicket. I waited, but she did not
come back. Then I stole into the place
after her, and in a moment there she
was before me; but without complaint
or any symptom of perturbation she
passed quietly along, and again I lost
her. I kept my position till I was tired,
and then went back to the wood and sat
down; and in a few minutes  how it
happened I could not tell  there she
stood once more, wearing the same in-
nocent, preoccupied air. This time I
saw her fly down the slope and disap-
pear in a clump of undergrowth. I fol-
lowed, took a seat, waited, and contin-
ued to wait. All was in vain. That
was the last of her. She had played her
cards well, or perhaps I had played mine
poorly; and finally I turned my steps
homeward, where a comparison of my
notes with Dr. Couess description proved
the bird to be, as I had believed, a fe-
male cerulean warbler. Her nest would
probably be the first one of its kind ever
found in Virginia.
	On the way a male sang and showed
himself. Now, too, I discovered for the
first time that there were tupelo trees
among the large oaks and walnuts; much
smaller than they, and for that reason,
it is to be snpposed, not noticed in my
three previous passages along the ave-
nue. They are particular favorites of
mine, and I made them sincere apolo-
gies. In another place was a patch of
what I knew must be the fragrant su-
macli, something I had wished to see
for many years: low, upright shrubs, yet
resembling poison ivy so closely that for
a minute I shrank from gathering a spe-
cimen, although I was certain beyond
a peradventure that the plant was not
poison ivy and could not be noxious to
the touch; just as people in general,
through force of early instruction and
example (miscalled instinct), shiver at
the thought of handling a snake, though
it be of some kind which they know to
be as harmless as a kitten. While in
chase of the cerulean, also, I had stum-
bled on several bunches of cancer-root
(Conopholis), rising out of the dead
leaves, a dozen or more of stems in each
close bunch; queer, unwholesome-look-
ing, yellowish things, reminding me of
ears of rice-corn, so called. I had never
seen the plant till the day before.
	The next morning my course was be-
yond discussion or argument. I must go
again to Lincoln Heights. The thought
of the female cerulean warbler and her
nest would not suffer me to do anything
else. But for that matter, I should prob-
ably have taken the same path had I
never seen her. The trees, the prospects,
and the general birdiness of the place
were of themselves an irresistible attrac-
tion. On the way I skirted a grove of
small pines, standing between the road
and the edge of Cedar Creek ravine:
dull, scrubby trees, like pitch-pines, but
less bright in color; of the same kind
as those amid which, on Cameron Hill
and Lookout Mountain, in Tennessee,
there had been so notable a gathering of
warblers the year before. Pinus pun-
gens, Table Mountain pine, I suppose
they were, though it must be acknow-
ledged that I was never at the pains to
settle the point. Here at Natural Bridge
I had found all such woods deserted day
after day, till I had ceased to think them
worth looking into. Now, however, as
I idled past, I caught the faint sibilant
notes of a bird - song, and stopped to
listen. Not a blackpolls, I said to my-
self, but wonderfully near it. And then
it flashed into my mind what a friend
had told me a few years before. When
you hear a song that is like the black-
polls, but different, he had said, look
the bird up. It will most likely be a
Cape May. He was one of the lucky
men (almost the only one of my acquaint-</PB>

ance) who had heard that rare warblers
voice. I turned aside, of course, and
made a cautious entry among the pines.
The bird continued its singing. Yes, it
was like the blackpolls, but with a zip
rather than a zee. Nearer and nearer
I crept, inch by inch. If the fellow
were a Cape May, it would be careless-
ness inexcusable not to make sure of the
fact. And soon I had my glass upon
him,  in high plumage, red cheeks and
all. He had not been disturbed in the
least, and kept up his music till I had
had my fill and could stay no longer, 
all the while in low branches and in clear
view. Few songs could be less interest-
ing in themselves, but few could have
been more welcome,  for the better part
of twenty years I had been listening for
it: about five notes, a little louder and
more emphatic than the blackpolls, it
seemed to me, but still faint and, as I
expressed it to myself, next to no-
thing. The handsome creature  olive
and bright yellow, boldly marked with
black and white  remained the whole
time in one tree, traveling over the limbs
in a rather listless fashion, and singing
almost incessantly. He was my hun-
dredth Virginia bird,  as my list then
stood, question marks included,  and
the second one whose song I had heard
for the first time on this vacation trip.
The day had begun prosperously.
	After such a stirring up, a mans ears
are apt to be abnormally sensitive, not to
say imaginative; then, if ever, he will
hear wonders: for which reason, it may
be, I had turned but a corner or two be-
fore I was stopped by another set of
notes, a strain that I knew, or felt that
I ought to know, but could not place a
name upon at the moment. This bird,
too, was run down without difficulty,
and proved to be a magnolia warbler, 
another yellow-rump, like the Cape May
and the myrtle-bird. The song, unlike
its owner, is but slightly marked, and to
make matters worse, is heard by me only
in the season of the birds spring pas
sage; but I laughed at myself for not
recognizing it. I was still in a mood for
discoveries, however, and within half an
hour was again in eager chase, this time
over a crazy zigzag fence into a dense
thicket, all for a black-and-white creeper
(my fiftieth specimen, perhaps, in the
last fortnight), whose notes, as they came
to me from a distance, sounded like a
creepers, to be sure, but with such a
measure of difference as kept me on net-
tles till the author of them was in sight.
I felt like a fool, as the common expres-
sion is, but was having a good time,
notwithstanding.
	Here were the first trailing blackber-
ry blossoms. The season was making
haste. Come, children, it is the 7th
of May, I seemed to hear the bud-
crowned spring saying. The woods
had burst into almost full leaf within a
week. This morning, also, I found the
first flowers of the Dodecatheon; three
plants, each with only one bloom as yet;
white, odd - looking, pointed,  like a
stylographic pen, my profane clerical
fancy suggested. American cowslip and
shooting star the flower is called in the
Manual. American cyclamen would hit
it pretty well, I thought, its most strik-
ing peculiarity being the reflexed, cycla-
menic carriage of the petals. I had been
wondering what those broad root-leaves
were, as I passed them here and there
in the woods. The present was only my
second sight of the blossom in a wild
state, the first one having been on the
battlefield of Chickamauga. It is mat-
ter for thankfulness, an enrichment of
the memory, when a pretty flower is
thus associated with a famous place.
	Among the old trees on the Heights a
cerulean warbler and a blue yellow-back
were singing nearly in the same breath.
If I did not become lastingly familiar
with the distinction between the two
songs, it was not to be the birds fault.
A second cerulean (or possibly the same
one; it was impossible to be certain on
that point, nor did it matter) was near</PB>

the grapevine tangle, and at the mo-
ment of my approach was holding a con-
troversy with a creeper. He had re-
served the spot, as it appeared, and was
insisting upon his claim. My spirits
rose. It was this clump of shrubbery
that I had come to sit beside, on the
chance of seeing again, and tracking to
her nest, the female whose behavior had
so excited my hopes the afternoon be-
fore. Nest small and neat, in fork of
a bough 2050 feet from the ground:
so I had read in the Key, and hence-
forth knew what I was to look for. For
a full hour I remained on guard. Twice
the male cerulean chased some other
bird about in a manner extremely sus-
picious; but he kept her (or him) so con-
stantly on the move that I had no fair
sight of her plumage. Beyond that my
vigil went for nothing. I must try again.
If a man cannot waste an hour once in
a while, he had better not undertake the
finding of birds nests.
	For the walk homeward I took a
course of my own down the open face
of the hill, climbing a fence or two (I
could tell far in advance the safest places
at which to get over  the soundest
spots  by seeing the lumps of dry red
clay left on the rails by the boots of pre-
vious travelers across lots), past prairie
warbiers and my first Natural Bridge
bluebird, to the bottom of the valley.
Then, finding myself ahead of time, I
turned aside to see what might be in the
woods of Buck Hill. There was little
to mention: a blossom of the exquisite
vernal fleur-de-lis, not before noticed
here, and at the top two cerulean war-
blers in full song. I had begun by this
time to believe that this rare Virginia
species would turn out to be pretty com-
mon hereabout in appropriate places.
	Partly to test the truth of this opinion
I planned an afternoon trip to a more
distant eminence, which, like Buck Hill
and Lincoln Heights, was covered with
a deciduous forest. In the valley woods
a grouse was drumming  a pretty fre
quent sound here  and Swainson
thrushes were singing. These New
Hampshire thrushes, by the bye, are
singers of the most generous sort, not
only at home, but on their travels, all
statements to the contrary notwithstand-
ing. From May 5 to May 12 includ-
ing the latter half of my stay at Natu-
ral Bridge, two days at Afton, and one
day in the cemetery woods at Arlington
 I have them marked as singing daily,
and one day at the Bridge they were
heard in four widely separate places.
	The hill for which I had set out lay
on the left of the road, and between me
and it stood a row of negro cabins. As
I came opposite them I suddenly caught
from the hillside the notes of a Nash-
ville warbler,  or so I believed. This
was a bird not yet included in my Vir-
ginia list. I bad puzzled over its ab-
sence  the country seeming in all re-
spects adapted to it  till I consulted
Dr. Rives, by whom it is set down as
rare. Even then, emboldened by
more than one happy experience, I told
myself that I ought to find it. It is
common enough in New England; why
should it skip Virginia? And here it
was; only I must go through the for-
mality of a visual inspection, especially
as just now the song came from rather
far away. I entered one of the house-
yards,  nobody objecting except a dog,
 climbed the rear fence, and posted up
the steep, rocky hill, past a humming-
bird sipping at a violet, and by and by
lifted my glass upon the singer, which
had been in voice all the while. By
this time I was practically sure of its
identity. In imagination I could already
see its bright yellow breast. The name
was as good as down in my book, 
Helminthophila ruficapilla. But the
glass, having no imagination, showed me
a white breast with a dark line across it,
 a cerulean warbler! Verily, an ear is
a vain thing for safety. See your bird, I
say, and take a second look; and then go
back and look again. In another tree a</PB>

parula warbler was singing. About him,
by good luck, I made no mistake. As
for the other bird, even after I had seen
his white breast, his tune  with which
he was literally spilling over  contin-
ued to sound amazingly Nashvillian;
though there are few warbler songs with
which I should have supposed myself
more thoroughly acquainted than with
this same clearly chara~terized Nash-
ville ditty,  a hurried measure followed
by a still more hurried trill. Perhaps
this particular cerulean had a note pe-
culiarly his own. I should be glad to
think so. Perhaps, on the other hand,
the fault was all with the man who heard
it; in which case the less said the bet-
ter. In either event, my theory as to the
ceruleans commonness was in a fair way
to be verified. It was well I had that
comfort.
	Before I could get down the hill again
I must stop to listen to a gnatcatcliers
squeaky voice, and the next moment I
saw the bird, and another with him.
The second one proceeded immediately
to a nest,  conspicuously displayed on
an oak branch, while her mate hovered
about, squeaking in the most affection-
ate manner. Then away they flew in
company, and after a long absence were
back again for another turn at building.
They were making a joy of their labor,
the male especially; but it is true he
made little else of it. With him I was
at once taken captive,  so happy, so
proud, and so devoted. A paragon of
amorous behavior, I called him; having
the French idea of assistance, no
doubt, but a lover in every movement.
Never was the good old-fashioned phrase
waiting upon her  more prettily il-
lustrated. Birds are imaginative crea-
tures, says Richard Jefferies, and I be-
lieve it; and this fellow, I am sure,
had endowed his spouse with all the
graces of all the birds that ever were or
ever will be. In other words, he was
truly in love. The nest was already
shingled throughout with bits of gray
lichen, laid on so skillfully that Father
Time himself might have done it. That
is the right way. Let the house look as
if it were a growth, a something native
to the spot, only less old than the ground
it rests on. The gnatcatchers nest is
always a work of art. Gnatcatcher eggs
could hardly be counted upon to hatch
in any other.
	As I passed up the road, on my way
homeward, a flock of eight nighthawks
were swimming overhead. Their genius
runs, not to architecture, but to grace of
aerial motion. They do not shoot like
the swifts, nor skim and dart like the
swallows, nor circle on level wings like
the hawks, but have an easy, slow-seem-
ing, wavering, gracefully limping
flight, which is strictly their own. At
the same time two buzzards met in mid-
air, one going with the breeze, the other
against it. I could have told the fact,
without other knowledge of the winds
course, by the different carriage of the
two pairs of wings. So the bird trims
her to the gale.
	Having the cerulean warbler question
still upon my mind, and seeing another
hard-woodhill within easy reach, I turned
my steps thither. Yes, I was hardly
there before I heard a bird singing; but
the reader may be sure I did not take
my ears word for it. This was the
fourth hilltop I had visited to-day, and
on every one the rare warbler (but
it is well known to be abundant in West
Virginia) had been found without so
much as a five-minute search.
	The next thing, of course, was to find
the nest, and so establish the fact of the
birds breeding. For that I had one
day left; and it may be said at once that
I spent the greater share of the next
forenoon in the vicinity of the grapevine
thicket, before mentioned, on Lincoln
Heights. A male cerulean was there,
 I both heard and saw him,  but no
female showed herself; and when at last
my patience ran out, I gave up the point
for good. She had been seen in the</PB>

diligent collection of building materials,
and that, considered as evidence, was
nearly the same as a discovery of the
nest itself. With that I must be con-
tent. The comfortable way of finding
birds nests is to happen upon them. A
regular hunt  a dead set, as we call
it  is apt to be a discouraging busi-
ness.
	My present attempt, it is true, was a
quiet, inactive piece of work, little more
than an idle waiting for the lady of the
nest to give herself away; and even
that was relieved by much looking at
mountain prospects and frequent turns in
the surrounding woods. Once a crossbill
called and a cardinal whistled almost in
the same breath,  a kind of northern
and southern duet. Then a cuckoo and
a dove fell to cooing on opposite sides of
me; very different sounds, though in our
poverty we designate them by the same
word. The doves voice is a thousand
times more plaintive than the cuckoos,
and to hear it, no matter how near,
might come from a mile away; as I
have known the little ground dove to be
mourning from a figtree at my elbow
while I was endeavoring to sight it far
down the field. The doves note is the
voice of the future or of the past, I am
not certain which. A few rods from
the spot where I had taken my station, a
single deerberry bush ( Vctccinium stctrni-
neum) was in profuse bloom, and made
a really pretty show; loose sprays of
white flaring blossoms all hanging down-
ward, each with its cluster of long pro-
truding stamens, till the bush, I thought,
was like a miniature candelabrum of
electric lights. As Thoreau might have
said, for so homely a plant the deerberry
is very handsome. Either from associ-
ation or for some other reason, it wears
always a certain common look. When
we see an azalea shrub or even an ap-
ple tree in bloom, we seem to see the
very object of its being. The flower
calls for no ulterior result, though it may
have one; its fruit is in itself. But a
blossoming blueberry bush, no matter of
what kind, looks like a plant that was
made to bear something edible, a plant
whose end is use rather than beauty.
	If the forenoon had been indolent, the
noonday hour was more so. I descend-
ed the hill by a way different from any
I had yet taken, and found myself at
the foot in a public road running through
a cultivated valley. The day was pecu-
liarly comfortable, with a bright sun and
a temperate breeze,  ideal weather for
such inactivities as I was engaged in.
Coming to an old cherry tree, I rested
awhile in its shadow. A farmhouse was
not far off, with apple trees before it, a
barn across the way, and two or three
men at work in the sloping ploughed
field beyond. To one as lazy as I then
was, it is almost a luxury to see other
men hoeing or ploughing, so they be far
enough off to become a part of the land-
scape. Near the barn stood a venerable
weeping willow, huge of girth, a very
patriarch, yet still green as youth itself.
Here were good farm-loving birds, a
pleasant society. A pair of house wrens
came at once to look at the stranger,
and one of them interested me by dust-
ing itself in the road. Two kingbirds
were about the apple trees (apple-tree
flycatchers would be my name for them,
if a name were in order), now sitting
quiet for a brief space, now scaling the
heavens, as if to see how nearly perpen-
dicular a birds flight could be made,
and then tumbling about ecstatically with
rapid vociferations, after the half-crazy
manner of their kind. The kingbird is
plentifully endowed not only with spirit,
but with spirits. A goldfinch sang and
twittered in the softest voice, and a cat-
bird mewed. From a quince bush, a lit-
tle farther off, a wild bobolinkian strain
was repeated again and again,  an
orchard oriole, I thought most likely. I
went nearer (to the shade of a low cedar),
and soon had him in sight,  a young
male in yellow plumage, with a black
throat-patch. The song was extremely</PB>

taking, and the more I heard it, the
more it seemed to have the true bobo-
link ring. The quince bushes were in
pale pink bloom, and the branches of a
tall snowball tree in the unfenced front
yard of the house fairly drooped under
their load of white globular clusters.
Just opposite was a sweet-brier bush,
the pastoral eglantine, half dead like
others that I had noticed here, and like
the whole tribe of its New England bro-
thers and sisters. Here as in Massa-
chusetts a blight was upon them; they
were living with difficulty. It would be
good, I thought, to see the sweet-brier
once where it flourishes; where the beau-
ty of the plant matches the beauty and
sweetness of the rose it bears. Can it
be that it is not quite hardy even in
Virginia?
	My seat under the snowball tree (to
the coolness of which I had moved from
under the cedar) had presently to be
given up. The women of the house be-
came aware of me, and out of a bashful
regard for my own comfort I took the
road again. Soon I passed a double
house, with painted doors and two-sash
windows! And in one of the windows
were lace curtains! It was wonderful, 
I was obliged to confess it, in spite of a
deep-seated masculine prejudice against
all such contrivances,  it was wonderful
what an air of elegance they conferred,
though the paint of the doors was to be
considered, of course, in the same con-
nection.
	By this time the road was approaching
the slope of Buck Hill, and high noon as
it was, I must run up for another half-
hour among the old trees at the top, 
with no special result except to disturb
a summer tanager, who fired off volley
after volley of objurgatory expletives,
and altogether seemed to be in a terrible
state of mind. His excitement was all
for nothing; unless  what was likely
enough  it served to give him favor in
the eyes of his mate, who may be pre-
sumed to have been somewhere within
hearing. Lovers, I believe, are supposed
to welcome an opportunity to play the
hero.
	My last afternoon at the Bridge was
devoted to a longish tramp into a new
piece of country, where for an hour I
had hopes of adding at least a name or
two to my Virginia bird-list, which for
twenty-four hours had been at a stand-
still. I came unexpectedly upon a mill,
and what was of greater account, a mill-
pond,  a long, dirty pond, as my
uncivil pencil describes it. Here were
swallows, as might have been foreseen,
but the most careful scrutiny revealed
nothing beyond the two species already
catalogued,  the barn swallow and the
rough - wing. Here, too, in an apple
orchard, were a Baltimore oriole gather-
ing straws, a phwbe, a golden warbler,
and several warbling vireos, the only ones
so far noticed with the exception of a
single bird at Pulaski. About the bor-
der of the pond were spotted sandpipers
(no solitaries, to my disappointment)
and two male song sparrows. This last
species I saw but twice in Virginia, 
along the bushy shore of the creek at
Pulaski, and here beside this millpond.
Wherever the song sparrow is scarce, it
is likely to be restricted to the imme-
diate neighborhood of water. Even in
Massachusetts it is pretty evident that
such places are its first choice. As I
sometimes say, the song sparrow likes a
swamp as well as the swamp sparrow;
but the species being so exceedingly abun-
dant, there are not swampy spots enough
to go round, and the majority of the birds
have to shift as they can, along bushy
fence - rows and in pastures and scrub-
lands.
	The building interested me almost as
much as the sandpipers and the spar-
rows. It was painted red, and served
not only as a mill, but as a post-office
( IRed Mills ) and a department
store, with its sign, Dry Goods, Gro-
ceries, &#38; c. A tablet informed the pass-
er-by that the mill had been estab</PB>

lished in 1798, destroyed in 1881, and
reopened in 1891; and on the same tab-
let, or another, was the motto, Labo-
rare est orare. I regretted not to meet
the proprietor, but he was nowhere in
sight, and I felt a scruple about intrud-
ing upon the time of a man who was at
once postmaster, miller, farmer, store-
keeper, and scholar. With that motto
before me,   Apologia pro vita sua,
he might have called it,  such an in-
trusion would have seemed a sacrilege.
	What I remember best about the whole
establishment is the song of a blue-gray
gnatcatcher, to which I stopped to listen
under a low savin tree on a bluff above
the mill. He was directly over my head,
singing somewhat in the manner of a
catbird, but I had almost to hold my
breath to hear him. It was amazing
that a birds voice could be spun so fine.
A mere shadow of a sound, I was ready
to say. It was only by the happiest ac-
cident that I did not miss it altogether.
Then, when the fellow had finished his
music, he began squeaking in that pe-
culiarly teasing manner of his, and kept
it up till I was weary. The gnatcatch-
er is a creature by himself, a miniature
bird, wonderfully slender, with a strange-
ly long tail, which he carries jauntily
and makes the most of on all occasions.
But if he only knew it, his chief claim
to distinction is his singing voice. If
the humming-birds is attenuated in the
same proportion (and who can assert the
contrary ?), he may be the finest vocalist
in the world, and we none the wiser.
	I was to start northward by the next
noonday train, and had already laid out
my forenoons work. Before breakfast
I took my last look at the famous bridge,
and my last stroll through Cedar Creek
ravine. I had been there every day, I
think, and had always found something
new. This time it was a slippery elm
tree by the saltpetre cave. I had brought
away a twig, and was sitting in my door
putting a lens upon it and upon a se-
dum specimen, when the veranda was
suddenly taken possession of by a dozen
or more of young men. They were just
up from the railway station, and were
deep in a discussion of ways and means,
 tickets, luncheons, and time-tables.
Then, in a momentary lull in the talk, I
heard a quiet voice say, Sedum. They
were a company of Johns Hopkins men
out upon a geological trip. So I learned
at noon when we met at the railway sta-
tion; and a pleasant botanical hour I
had with one or two of them as we rode
northward. Now, on the piazza, they
did not tarry long; time was precious to
them also; and as soon as they had gone
down to the bridge I set off in the oppo-
site direction. My final ramble was to
be to Lincoln Heights, to see once more
that magnificent avenue of trees and
that beautiful mountain prospect. The
cerulean warbler was singing as usual,
but there was no sign of his mate, though
I could not do less than to wait a little
while by the grapevine thicket in a vain
hope of her appearance. Here, as in
the ravine, I had not yet seen everything.
Straight before me stood a locust tree,
every branch hung with long, fragrant
white clusters. I had overlooked it com-
pletely till now. If I learned nothing
else in Virginia, I ought to have learned
something about my limitations as an
observer. But I need not have tra-
veled so far for such a purpose. Wis-
dom so common as that may be picked
up any day in a mans own dooryard.

THE BATTLE OF THE STRONG.

XXV.

	GUIDA was sitting on the veille read-
ing an old London paper which she had
bought of the mate on the packet from
Southampton. One page contained an
account of the execution of Louis XVI.;
another reported the fight between the
English thirty-six gun frigate Araminta
and the French Niobe. The engagement
had been desperate, the valiant Aramin-
ta having been fought not alone against
odds as to her enemy, but against the
irresistible perils of a coast of which the
Admiralty charts gave cruelly imperfect
information. To the Admiralty was due
the fact that the Araminta was now at
the bottom of the sea, and its young com-
mander confined in a French fortress, his
brave and distinguished services lost to
the country. Nor had the government
yet sought to lessen the injury by ar-
ranging a cartel for the release of the
unfortunate commander.
	The Araminta! To Guida the letters
of the word seemed to stand out from
the paper like shining hieroglyphs on a
misty gray curtain. All the rest of the
page was resolved into a filmy floating
substance, no more tangible than the ashy
skeleton of burnt paper on which writing
still lives when the paper itself has been
eaten by flame, and the flame swallowed
by the air.
	Araminta,  this was all her eyes
saw; that familiar name in the flaring,
fantastic handwriting of the genius of
life, who had scrawled her destiny in
that one word.
	Slowly the monstrous ciphers faded
from the gray hemisphere of space, and
she saw again the newspaper in her trem-
bling fingers, the kitchen into which the
sunlight streamed from the open window,
the dog Biribi basking in the doorway.
That living quiet which descends upon
a kitchen when the midday meal and
work are done came suddenly home to
her, in contrast to the turmoil of her mind
and being.
	So that was why Philip had not writ-
ten to her! While her heart was grow-
ing bitter against him, he had been fight-
ing his vessel against great odds, and at
last had been shipwrecked and carried off
a prisoner. A strange new understand-
ing took possession of her. Her life
widened. She realized all at once how
the eyes of the whole world might be
fixed upon a single ship, a few cannon,
and some scores of men. The general of
a great army leading tens of thousands
into the clash of battle,  that had al-
ways been within her comprehension; but
this was almost miraculous, this abrupt
projection of one ship and her command-
er upon the canvas of fame. Philip had
left her, unknown save to a few; with
the nations turned to see, he had made a
gallant and splendid fight, and now he
was a prisoner in a French fortress!
	This, then, was why her grandfather
had received no letter from Philip con-
cerning the marriage. Well, she must
now speak for herself; she must an-
nounce her marriage. Must she show
Philips letters? No, no, she could not.
	Then a new suggestion came to
her: there was one remaining proof of
her marriage. Since no banns had been
published, Philip must have obtained a
license from the dean of the island, and
he would have a record of it. All she
had to do now was to get a copy of this
record. But no, a license to marry was
no proof of marriage; it was but evi-
dence of intention.
	Still, she would go to the dean this
very moment. It was not right that she
should wait longer: indeed, in waiting so
long she had already done great wrong
to herself, and maybe to Philip.</PB></P>

page was resolved into a filmy floating
substance, no more tangible than the ashy
skeleton of burnt paper on which writing
still lives when the paper itself has been

	Araminta,  this was all her eyes

	Slowly the monstrous ciphers faded

ing bitter against him, he had been fight-
ing his vessel against great odds, and at
last had been shipwrecked and carried off
a prisoner. A strange new understand-
ing took possession of her. Her life
widened. She realized all at once how
the eyes of the whole world might be
fixed upon a single ship, a few cannon,
and some scores of men. The general of
a great army leading tens of thousands
into the clash of battle,  that had al-
ways been within her comprehension; but
this was almost miraculous, this abrupt
projection of one ship and her command-
er upon the canvas of fame. Philip had
left her, unknown save to a few; with
the nations turned to see, he had made a
gallant and splendid fight, and now he
was a prisoner in a French fortress!
	This, then, was why her grandfather
had received no letter from Philip con-
cerning the marriage. Well, she must
now speak for herself; she must an-
nounce her marriage. Must she show
Philips letters? No, no, she could not.
	Then a new suggestion came to
her: there was one remaining proof of
her marriage. Since no banns had been
published, Philip must have obtained a
license from the dean of the island, and
he would have a record of it. All she
had to do now was to get a copy of this
record. But no, a license to marry was
no proof of marriage; it was but evi-
dence of intention.
	Still, she would go to the dean this
very moment. It was not right that she
should wait longer: indeed, in waiting so
long she had already done great wrong
to herself, and maybe to Philip.</PB>

	She rose from the veille with a sense
of relief. No more of this secrecy, mak-
ing her innocence seem guilt; no more
painful dreams of punishment for some
intangible crime; no more starting if she
heard an unexpected footstep; no more
hurried walk through the streets, look-
ing neither to right nor to left; no more
inward struggles wearing away her life.
	To-morrow  to-morrow  no, this
very night, her grandfather and one oth-
er, even Maitresse Aimable, should know
all; and she should sleep so quietly, oh,
so quietly, to-night.
	Looking into a mirror on the wall, 
it had been a gift of the chevalier,  she
smiled at herself. Why, how foolish of
her it had been to feel so much and to
imagine terrible things! Her eyes were
shining now, and her hair, catching the
sunshine from the window, glistened like
burnished copper. She turned to see how
it shone on the temple and the side of her
head. How Philip had loved her hair!
Her eyes lingered for a moment placidly
on herself; then she started abruptly. A
wave of feeling, a shiver, passed through
her, her brow gathered in perplexity, she
flushed deeply.
Turning away from the mirror, she
went and sat down again on the edge
of the veille. Her mind had changed.
She would go to the deans, but not till
it was dark. She suddenly thought it
strange that the dean had never said any-
thing about the license. Why, again,
perhaps he had! How should she know
what gossip was going on in the town?
But no, she was quick to feel, and if there
had been gossip she would have felt it in
the manner of her neighbors. Besides,
gossip as to a license to marry was all on
the right side. She sighed  she had
sighed so often of late  to think what
a tangle it all was, of how it would be
smoothed out to-morrow, of what 
There was a click of the garden gate,
a footstep ou the walk, a half-growl
from Biribi, and the face of Carterette
Mattingley appeared in the kitchen door-
way. Seeing Guida sitting on the veille,
she came in quickly, her dancing dark
eyes heralding great news.
	Dont get up, ma couzaine, she said,
please dont. Sit just there, and let
me sit beside you. Ah, but I have the
most wonderful news!
	Carterette was out of breath. She had
hurried here from her home. As she said
herself, her two feet were nt in one shoe
on the way, and that and her news made
her quiver with excitement.
	At first, palpitating with eagerness,
bursting with mystery, she could do no
more than sit and look into Guidas face.
Carterette was quick of instinct in her
way, but yet she had not seen any
marked change in her friend during the
past few months. Certainly Guida had
not been so buoyant as was her wont,
but Carterette herself had been so occu-
pied in thinking of her own particular
secret that she was not observant of oth-
ers. At times she saw Ranulph, and then
she was uplifted, to be immediately de-
pressed again; for she perceived that he
was cast down, that his old cheerfulness
was gone, and that a sombreness had
settled on him. Somehow, though she
was not quite happy when she did not
see him, she was then even happier than
when she did, for she seemed so power-
less to lighten his gravity. She flattered
herself, however, that she could do so if
she had the right and the good oppor-
tunity,  the more so that Ranulph no
longer visited the cottage in the Place
du Vier Prison.
	That drew her closer to Guida, also;
for in truth Carterette had no loftiness
of nature. Like most people, she was
selfish enough to hold a person a little
dearer for not standing in her own par-
ticular light. Long ago she had shrewd-
ly guessed that Guidas interest lay else-
where than with Ranulph, and when
Philip dAvranche was in St. Heliers
she had fastened upon him as the object
of Guidas favor. But then many sail-
ors had made love to her, and knowing</PB>

it was here to-day and away to-morrow
with them, her heart had remained un-
touched. Why, then, should she think
Guida would take the officer seriously
where she herself held the sailor light-
ly? But at the same time she had
an instinct that what concerned Philip
would interest Guida,  she herself al-
ways cared to hear the fate of an old ad-
mirer,  and this was what had brought
her to the cottage to-day.
	Guess who I ye got a letter from!
she asked of Guida, who had taken up
some sewing, and was now industriously
regarding the stitches.
	At Carterettes question Guida looked
up and said with a smile, From some
one you like, I know.
	Carterette laughed gayly. Ba sfi,
I should think I did  in a way. But
what s his name? Come, guess, Mam-
selle Dignity.
	Eh ben, the fairy godmother, an-
swered Guida, trying hard not to show
an interest she felt all too keenly; for
nowadays it seemed to her that all news
should be about Philip. Besides, she
was gaining time and preparing herself
for  she knew not what!
Oh my grief! responded the brown-
eyed elf, kicking off the red slipper that
had once so vexed the Lady of St.
Michael, and thrusting her foot into it
again, never a fairy godmother had I,
unless it s old Manon Moignard, the
witch: 
Sas, son, bileton,
My grandm~the a-fishing has gone:
She 11 gather the fins to scrape my jowl,
And ride back home on a barnyard fowl!

Nannin, mamselle, it s plain to be seen
you cant guess what a cornfield grows
besides red poppies! and laughing in
sheer delight at the mystery she was
making, she broke off into a whimsical
nursery rhyme: 
Coquelicot, jai mal an
Coquelicot, quest qni la fait?
Coquelicot, chtai moa valet.

She kicked off her red slipper again,
and flying halfway across the room it
alighted on the table, and a little mud
from the heel dropped on the clean
scoured surface. With a little moue of
mockery, she slowly got up and tiptoed
across the floor, like a child afraid of
being scolded. Gathering the dirt care-
fully, and looking demurely askance at
Guida the while, she tiptoed over to the
fireplace with it.
	Naughty Carterette! she said at
herself with admiring reproval, as she
looked in Guidas mirror, and added, as
she glanced with farcical approval round
the room, And it all shines like a pea-
cocks feather, too!
	Guida longed to snatch the letter from
Carterettes hand and read it, but she
only said calmly, though the words flut-
tered in her throat, You re as gay as
a chaffinch, gar~on Carterette!
	Gar~on Cctrterette! Instantly Carte-
rette sobered down. No one save Ra-
nulph had ever called her gar~on Car-
terette!
	Guida had used the words purposely;
she had heard Ranulph call Carterette by
them, and she knew they would change
the madcaps mood. Carterette, to hide
a sudden flush, stooped and slowly put
on her slipper. Then she came back to
the veille, and sat down beside Guida,
saying as she did so, Yes, I m always
as gay as a chaffinch  me!
	She unfolded the letter slowly, and
Guida stopped sewing, but with the point
of her needle mechanically began to
prick the linen lying on her knee.
	Well, said Carterette deliberately,
this letter is from a pendloque of a fel-
low,  at least, we used to call him that,
 though if you come to think, he was
always polite as a mended porringer.
It was nt often he had two sous to rub
against each other, and  and not enough
buttons for his clothes!
	Guida smiled. She guessed whom Car-
terette meant. Has Monsieur D&#38; ri-
cand more buttons now? she asked, with
a little whimsical lift of the eyebrows.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00278" SEQ="0278" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="272">	272	The Battle of t~he Strong.

	Ah bidemme, yes, and gold too, all
over him  like that! She made a
quick sweeping gesture with her hand,
which would seem to make D6tricand a
very spangle of buttons. Come, what
do you think? He s a general now!
	A general ! Instantly Guida thought
of Philip, and a kind of envy shot into
her heart that this vaurien D6tricand
should mount so high in a few months, 
a man whose past had shown nothing
to warrant such success. A general!
Where? she asked.
	In the Yend&#38; army, fighting for
the new King of France; you know the
Revolutionists cut off the ]ast Kings
head.
	At another time Guidas heart would
have throbbed with elation, for the ro-
mance of that union of aristocrat and
peasant appealed keenly to her imagina-
tion; but she only said in the patois of
the people themselves, Ma fuifre 
yes, I know.
	Carterette was delighted to dole out
her news thus, and get her due reward
of astonishment. And he s got an-
other name, she added. At least, it s
not another; he always had it, but be
did nt call himself by it. Pardi, he s
more than the chevalier; he s the Comte
D~tricand de Tournay. Ah, then, be-
lieve me if you choose! There it is.
She pointed to the signature of the let-
ter, and with a gush of eloquence ex-
plained how it all was about D6tricand
the vaurien and D~tricand the Comte de
Tournay.
	Good riddance to Monsieur Savary
dit D6tricand, and good welcome to
Monsieur the Comte de Tournay, an-
swered Guida, trying hard to humor
Carterette, that she might sooner hear
the news yet withheld. And what
comes after that?
	Carterette was half sorry that her
great moment had come; she wished she
could have prolonged the suspense. But
she let herself be comforted by the an-
ticipated effect of her wonderful on dit.
	I 11 tell you what comes after  ah,
but see, then, what a wonder I have for
you! You know that Monsieur Philip
dAvranche: well, what do you think has
happened to him?
	Guida felt as if some mor~trous hand
had her heart in its grasp, crushing it.
Presentiment took possession of her.
Carterette was busy running over the
pages of the letter, and did not notice
how her face bad lost its color. She
had no thought that Guida had any vital
interest in Philip, and she ruthlessly,
though unconsciously, began to torture
the young wife as few are tortured in
this world.
	She read aloud D6tricands descrip-
tion of his visit to the castle of Bercy,
and of the meeting with Philip.
	See what comes of a name!
wrote D6tricand, and repeated Carte-
rette.  Here was a poor prisoner whose
ancestor, hundreds of years ago, may or
may not have been a relative of the
dAvranches of Clermont, when a disap-
pointed duke, with an eye open for heirs,
takes a fancy to the good-looking face
of the poor prisoner, and voih! you
have him whisked off to a castle, fed on
milk and honey, and adopted into the
family. Then a pedigree is nicely grown
on a summer day, and this fine young
Jersey adventurer is found to be a green
branch from the old root; and there s
a great blare of trumpets, and the states
of the duchy are called together to make
this English officer a prince  and thats
the Thousand and One Nights in Arabia,
Mamselle Carterette!
Guida was sitting rigid and still. In
the slight pause Carterette made, a hun-
dred confused, torturing thoughts ran
swiftly through her mind, and presently
floated into the succeeding sentences of
the letter: 
As for me, I m like Rabots mare,
I have nt time to laugh at my own fool-
ishness. I m either up to my knees in
grass or clay fighting Revolutionists, or
I m riding hard day and night till I m</PB>

round-backed like a wood-louse, to make
up for all the good time I so badly lost
in your little island. You would not
have expected that, my friend with the
tongue that stings, would you? But
then, mamselle of the red slippers, one
is never butted save by a dishorned cow,
as your father used to say.
	Carterette paused again, saying in an
aside, That is msieu all over, all so
gay. But who knows? For he says,
too, that the other day, a-fighting Fon-
tenay, five thousand of his men come
across a cavalry as they run to take the
guns that eat them up like cabbages, and
they drop on their knees, and he drops
with them, and they all pray to God to
help them, while the cannon-balls whiz-
whiz over their heads. He says God
did hear them, for He told theni that if
they fell down fiat when the guns were
fired the balls would nt touch em.
	During this interlude, Guida, full of
impatience and anxiety, could scarcely
sit still. She began sewing again, though
her fingers trembled so that she could
hardly make a stitch. But Carterette,
the little egotist, did not notice her dis-
turbance; her own excitement dimmed
her observation.
	She began reading again. The first
few words had little or no significance
for Guida, but presently she was held as
by the fascination of a serpent.
And, Mamselle Carterette, what
do you think this young captain, now
Prince Philip dAvranche and successor
to the title of Bercy,  what do you think
he is next to do? Even to marry a
countess of great family whom the old
duke has chosen for him, so that the
name of dAvranche may not die out in
the land. And that is the way that love
begins. . . . Wherefore I want you to
write and tell me 
What he wanted Carterette to tell
him Guida hever heard, though it con-
cerned herself, for she gave a cry like a
dumb animal in agony, and sat rigid
and blanched, the needle she had been
	VOL. LXXXII. ~ No. 490.	18
using imbedded in her finger to the bone,
but not a motion, not a sign of human
animation, in her face or figure.
	All at once some conception of the
truth burst upon the aifrighted Carte-
rette. She had all along thought that
Philip and Guida had liked each other,
but she had never thought of aught se-
rious between them. Besides, in her
childish egotism, as unconscious as it was
heartless, she had seen in the present
letter no more than the great news it
contained. She imagined the real truth
as little as D6tricand had done.
	But now she saw the blanched face,
the filmy eyes, the stark look, the finger
pierced by the needle, and she knew
that a human heart had been pierced,
too, with a pain worse than death. It
was worse; for she had seen death, and
she had never seen anything like this in
its dire misery and horror. She caught
the needle quickly from the finger,
wrapped her kerchief round the wound,
threw away the sewing from Guidas
lap, and running an arm about her waist
made as if to lay a hot cheek against
the cold face of her friend. Suddenly,
however, with a new and painful know-
ledge, and a face as white and scared
as Guidas own, she ran to the dresser,
caught up a hanap, and brought some
water. Guida still sat as though life
had left her, and the body, arrested in
its activity, would presently relax and
collapse.
	Carterette was no irresponsible, light-
headed, stupid peasant; she had sense,
resolution, and self-possession. She ten-
derly put the water to Guidas lips, with
comforting, reassuring words, though her
own brain was in a whirl, and a hun-
dred dark premonitions flashed through
her mind.
	Ah, man gui, man p~the! she said
in the homely patois. There, drink,
drink, dear, dear couzaine! Guidas
lips opened, and she drank slowly, put-
ting her hand to her heart with a gesture
of pain. Carterette set down the hanap</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00280" SEQ="0280" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="274">	274	The Battle of the Strong.
and caught her hands. Come, come,
these cold hands,  pergui, but we must
stop that! They are so cold! She
rubbed them hard. The poor child
of heaven, what has come over you?
Speak to me. . . . Ah, but see, every-
thing will come all right by and by!
God is good. Nothing s as bad as what
it seems. There was never a gray wind
but there s a grayer. Nannin-gia, take
it not so to heart, my couzaine; thou
shalt have love enough ia the world!
	Ah, grand doux dla vie, but I could
kill him! she added under her breath,
and she rubbed Guidas hands still, and
looked frankly, generously, into her eyes.
Yet, try as she would in that supreme
moment, she could not feel all she used
to do concerning her. There is some-
thing humiliating in even an undeserved
injury,  something which, in average
human eyes, depreciates the worthiness of
its victim. To this hour Carterette had
looked upon Guida as a being far above
her own companionship, an idea which
Guida herself always had combated.
All in a moment, however, in this new
office of comforter to her anguished and
abandoned friend, their relative status
was altered. The plane on which Guida
had moved was lowered; pity, while it
deepened the kindness and tenderness,
lessened the gap between them.
	Perhaps something of this passed
through Guidas mind, and the deep
pride and courage of her nature came
to her assistance. She withdrew her
hands from Carterettes and mechani-
cally smoothed back her hair, and then,
as Carterette sat watching her, folded
up the sewing and put it in the work-
basket hanging on the wall beside the
veille.
	There was something unnatural in
her governance of herself now. She
seemed as if doing things in a dream,
but she did them accurately and with
apparent purpose. She looked at the
clock; then went to light the fire, for
it was almost time to get her grand-
fathers tea. She did not appear con-
scious of the presence of Carterette,
who still sat on the veille, not knowing
quite what to do. At last, as the flame
flashed up in the chimney, she came
over to her friend, and said, Carte-
rette, I am going to the deans. Will
you run and ask Maitresse Aimable to
come here to me soon?
	Her voice was steady, but it was the
steadiness of despair,  that steadiness
which comes to those upon whose nerves
has fallen a great numbness, upon whose
sensibilities has settled a cloud which
stills them as the thick mist stills the
ripples on the waters of a fen.
	All the glamour of Guidas youth had
dropped away. She had deemed life
good, and behold, it was not good; she
had thought her dayspring was on high,
and her happiness had burnt out into
the darkness like quick-consuming flax.
But all was strangely quiet in her heart
and mind. Nothing more that she
feared could happen to her; the worst
had happened, and now there came down
on her the impervious calm of the
doomed.
	Carterette was awed by her face, and
saying that she would go at once to Mal-
tresse Aimable she started toward the
door, but as quickly stopped and came
back to Guida, who was taking her hat
from a nail. With none of the impulse
that usually marked her actions, Carte-
rette put her arms round Guidas neck
and kissed her, saying with a subdued
intensity and purpose, I d go through
fire and water for you. I want to help
you every way I can  me!
	Guida did not reply, but she kissed
the hot cheek of the smuggler-pirates
daughter as in dying one might kiss the
face of a friend seen with filmy eyes,
and sent her away.
	When she had gone Guida drew her-
self up with a shiver; yet she was con-
scious that new senses and instincts were
born in her, or were now first awakened
to life. She could not quite command</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00281" SEQ="0281" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="275">	The Battle of the Strong.	275

them yet, but she felt them, and, in so
far as she had power to think, she used
them.
	Leaving the house and stepping into
the Place du Vier Prison, she walked
quietly and steadily up the Rue dDri~re.
She did not notice that people she met
glanced at her curiously, and turned to
look after her as she hurried on.


XXVI.

	It had been a hot, oppressive day, but
when, a half-hour later, Guida hastened
back through the Place du Vier Prison
a vast black cloud had drawn up from
the southeast, dropping a curtain of dark-
ness upon the town. As she neared the
doorway of the cottage a few heavy drops
began to fall, and in spite of her over-
powering trouble she quickened her foot-
steps, fearing that her grandfather had
come back to find the house empty and
no light or supper ready.
	M. de Mauprat had preceded her by
not more than five minutes. His foot-
steps across the Place du Vier Prison
had been unsteady, his head bowed,
though more than once he raised it with
a sort of effort, as it were in indignation
or defiance. He muttered to himself as
he opened the door, and he paused in
the hallway as though hesitating to go
forward. After a moment he made a
piteous gesture of his hand toward the
kitchen, and whispered to himself in a
kind of reassurance. Then he entered
the room and stood still. All was dark
save for the glimmer of the fire.
	Guida! Guida! he said in a shak-
ing, muffled voice. There was no an-
swer. He put his hat and stick in the
corner, and felt his way past the table
to his great chair,  he seemed to have
lost his sight. Finding the familiar worn
arm of the chair, he seated himself with
a heavy sigh. His lips moved, and he
shook his head now and then as though in
protest against some unspoken thought.
	Presently he brought his clenched
hand down heavily on the chair-arm,
and said aloud, They lie! they lie!
The conn6table lies! Their tongues
shall be cut out. . . . Ah, my little, little
child! - . . The conn6table dared  he
dared  to tell me this evil gossip  of
my little one  of my Guida!
	He laughed contemptuously, but it
was a crackling, dry laugh, painful in its
cheerlessness. He drew his snuff-box
from his pocket, opened it, and slowly
taking a pinch raised it toward his
nose; but the hand paused halfway, as
though a new thought had arrested it.
	In the pause there came the sound of
the front door opening, and then foot-
steps in the hall.
	The pinch of snuff fell from the fin-
gers of the old man upon the white
cloth of his short-clothes, but as Guida
entered the kitchen and stood still a mo-
merit he did not stir in his seat. The
thundercloud had come still lower and
the room was dark, even the coals in the
fireplace being now covered with gray
ashes.
	Grandpethe! Grandp~the! Guida
said.
	He did not answer. His heart was
fluttering; his tongue clove to the roof
of his mouth, dry and thick. Now he
should know the truth; now he should
be sure that they had lied about his lit-
tle Guida, those slanderers of the Vier
Marchi. But, too, he had a strange, de-
pressing fear, at variance with his loving
faith and belief that in Guida there was
no wrong,  such a belief as has the
strong swimmer that he can reach the
shore through the wave and tide; yet
also with the strange foreboding, prelud-
ing the cramp that makes powerless, de-
fying youth, strength, and skill. He
could not have spoken if it had been to
save his own life or hers.
	Getting no answer to her words, Guida
went first to the chimney and stirred the
fire, the old man sitting rigid in his
chair, and regarding her with fixed,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00282" SEQ="0282" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="276">	276	The Battle of the Strong.
watchful eyes. Then she found two
candles and lighted them, placing them
on the mantel, and, going to the eras-
set which hung by its osier rings from a
beam in the middle of the room, slowly
lighted it. Turning round, she was full
in the light of the candles and the shoot-
ing flames of the fire.
The Sieur de Mauprats eyes had fol-
lowed her every motion, unconscious of
his presence as she was. This, this was
not the Guida he had known! This was
not his grandchild, this woman with the
pale, cold face and dark, unhappy eyes;
this was not the laughing girl who but
yesterday was a babe at his knee. This
was not
The truth, which had yet been before
his blinded eyes how long, burst upon
him. The shock of it snapped the filmy
thread of being. As the soul, escaping,
found its wings, spread them, and rose
from that dun morass called life, the
Sicur de Mauprat, giving a long, deep
sigh, fell back in the great armchair
dead, nnd the silver snuff-box rattled to
the floor.
	Guida turned with a sharp cry. She
ran to him, and lifted up the head that
lay over on his shoulder; she called to
him, she felt his pulse. Opening his
waistcoat, she put her ear to his heart;
but it was still  still.
	A mist came over her own eyes, and
without a cry or a word she slid down-
ward to the floor, unconscious, as the
black thunderstorm broke upon the Place
du Vier Prison.

	The rain was like a curtain let down
between the prying, clattering world
without and the strange peace within:
the old man in his perfect sleep; the
young, misused wife in that oblivion bor-
rowed from death, and as tender and
companionable while it lasts.
	As if in a merciful indulgence, Fate
permitted no one to enter upon the dark
scene save a woman in whom was a deep
motherhood which had never nourished
a child, and to whom this silence and
this sorrow gave no terrors. Silence
was her constant companion, and for
sorrow she had been granted the touch
that assuages the sharpness of pain, and
the love that is called neighborly kind-
ness.
	Unto her it was given to minister here.
As the night went by, and the offices had
been done for the dend, she took her place
by the bedside of the young wife, who lay
staring into space, tearless and still, the
life consuming away within her.
	But at last, toward morning, sleep
caine, as suddenly as death had come to
the Sicur de Mauprat. Then Maitresse
Aimable went into the kitchen, and on
to the front room, where, with his head
buried in his hands, Ranuiph Delagarde
sat watching beside the body of the Sicur
de Mauprat.

	In the IRue dDriere, the undertaker
and his head apprentice were very mer-
ry. But why should they not have been?
People had to die, quoth the undertaker,
and when dead they must be buried:
burying was a trade, and wherefore
should not one  discreetly  be cheer-
ful at ones trade? In undertaking there
were many miles to trudge with coffins
in a week, and the fixed, sad, sympa-
thetic look which long custom had ste-
reotyped was as wearisome to the face
as a cast of plaster of Paris. M6reover,
the undertaker was master of ceremonies
at the house of bereavement as well. He
not only arranged the funeral; he sent
out the invitations to the friends of
deceased, who are requested to return
to the house of the mourners after the
obsequies for refreshment. The pre-
parations for this feast were all made
by the undertaker,  master of burials,
as he chose to be called.
	Once, after a busy six months, in
which a fever had carried off many a
Jersiais, this master of burials had given</PB>

a picnic to his apprentices, workmen, and
their families. At this buoyant function
he bad raised his glass, and with a play-
ful plaintiveness had proposed, The
day we celebrate!
	He was in a no less blithesome mood
this day. The head apprentice was read-
ing aloud the accounts for the burials of
the month, while the master was check-
ing off the items, nodding approval, com-
menting, correcting, or condemning with
strange expletives.
	Dont gabble, gabble! Next one
slowlee! said the master of burials, as
the second account was laid aside, duly
approved. Eli ben, now let s hear the
next. Who is it  him?
	That Josu6 Anquetil, answered the
apprentice.
	The master of burials rubbed his hands
together with a creepy sort of glee. Ah,
that was a clever piece of work! Too
little of a length and a width for the
box; but let us be thankful,  it might
have been too short, and it was nt.
	No danger of that, pardingue, broke
in the apprentice. The first it belonged
to was a foot longer than Josu6  he.
	But I made the most of Josu6, con-
tinued the master. The mouth was
crooked, but he was clean, clean,  I
shaved him just in time. And he had
good hair for combing to a peaceful look,
and he was light to carry,  oh my good!
Go on: what has Josu6 the centenier to
say for himself?
	With a drawling, dull indifference, the
lank, hatchet-faced servitor of the master
servitor of the grave read off the items:
The Relict of J4sue Anquetil, (Jentenier, in ac-
count with Etienne Mahye, Master of Burials.

	The master of burials interrupted:
Bat dla goule, you ye forgot the black-
ing for coffin!
The apprentice made the correction
without deigning reply, and then pro-
ceeded :

	blacking coffin	0 3
Ditto to me, E. M., paid out for sup-
per after obsquies           3 2

	The apprentice stopped. That s
all, he said.
	There was a furious leer on the face
of the master of burials. So, after all
his care, apprentices would never learn
to make mistakes on his side. Always
on the side of the corpse, that can thank
nobody for naught, oh my grief! was
his snarling comment. What about
those turnips from D6nise Gareau, num-
skull! he squeaked, in a voice some-
thing between a sneer and a snort.
The apprentice was unmoved. He
sniffed, rubbed his nose with a fore-
finger, laboriously wrote for a moment,
and then added: 
Ditto to Madame D~nise Gareau
for turnips for supper after ob
	squies	10 sols.

	Saperlote! leave out the madame,
calf-logs  you!
	The apprentice did not move a finger.
Obstinacy sat enthroned on him. In a
rage, the master made a snatch at a
metal flower-wreath to throw at him.
	Shant! She s my aunt. I knows
my duties to my aunt  me! remarked
the apprentice stolidly.
	The master burst out in a laugh of
scorn. Gadrabotin, here s family</PB>

pride for you! I 11 go stick dandelines
in my old sows ear,  resp6 dla corn-
pagnie.
	The apprentice was still calm. If
you want to flourish yourself, dont mind
me, said he, and picking up the next
account he began reading 
Mademoiselle Landresse, in the matter of the burial
of the Sieur de Mauprat, to Etienne Miahye, etc.

Item 
	The first words read by the appren-
tice had stilled the breaking storm of the
masters anger. It dissolved in a fra-
grant dew of proud reminiscence, profit,
speculation, and scandal.
	He himself had no open prejudices.
He was an official of the public,  or
so he counted himself,  and he very
shrewdly knew his duty in that walk of
life to which it had pleased Heaven to
call him. The greater the notoriety of
the death, the more in evidence was the
master and all his belongings. Death
with honor was an advantage to him;
death with disaster was a boon; death
with scandal was a godsend. It brought
tears of gratitude to his eyes when the
death and the scandal were in high
places. These were the only real tears
he ever shed. His heart was in his head,
and the head thought solely of Etienne
Mahye. Though he wore an air of sor-
row and sympathy in public, he had no
more feeling than a hangman. His sym-
pathy seemed to say to the living, I
wonder how soon you 11 come into my
hands! and to the dead, What a pity
you can die only once, and that second-
hand coffins are so hard to get!
Item  paid to me, Etienne Mahyc, for rose-
wood coffin 
droned the voice of the apprentice,
	Oh my good! interrupted the mas-
ter of burials, with a barren chuckle.
Oh my good, that was a day in a life-
time! I ye done fine work in my time,
but the Lord bestowed his countenance
upon that day,  not a cloud above, no
dust beneath, a flowing tide, and a calm
sea. The Royal Court, too, caught on a
sudden marching in their robes, turns to
and joins the cortegee, and the little birds
a-tweeting-tweeting, and two parsons at
the grave. Pardingue, but the Lord was
with me, and 
The apprentice laughed,  a dry,
mirthless laugh of disbelief and ridicule.
Ba s~, master, the Lord was watching
you. There was two silver bits inside
that coffin!
Bigre!  The master was pale with
rage. His lips drew back, disclosing his
long dark teeth and sickly gums,  a
grimace of fury. He reached out to seize
a hammer lying at his hand, but the
apprentice said quickly, 
That s the cholera hammer  ah
bah!
	The mastei~ of burials dropped the
hammer as though it were at white heat,
and eyed it with scared scrutiny. This
hammer had been used in nailing down
the coffins of six cholera patients who had
died in one house at Rozel Bay a year
before. The master would not go near
the place, so this apprentice had gone,
on a promise from the Royal Court that
he should have for himself  this is what
he asked  free lodging in two small up-
per rooms of the Cohue Royale, just un-
der the bell which said to the world, Chi-
cane  chicane! Chicane  chicane!
	This he asked, and this he got, and he
alone of all Jersey went out to bury three
persons who had died of cholera; and
then to watch three others die, to bury
them as soon as they were cold, and
come back, with a leer of satisfaction,
to claim his price. At first people were
inclined to make a hero of him, but that
only made him grin the more, and the
island reluctantly decided at last that
he had done the work solely for fee and
reward.
	The hammer he had used in nailing
the coffins he had carried through the
town, like an emblem of terror and death,
and henceforth he alone in the shop of
the master of burials used it.
	It wont hurt you if you leave it</PB>

alone, said the apprentice grimly to the
master of burials. But if you go
bothering, I 11 put it in your bed, and
it 11 do after to nail down your coffin
 you!
	Then he went on reading with a dull,
malicious calmness, as if the matter were
the merest trifle, and he were anxious to
get on with his work: 
Item  one dozen pairs of gloves for mourners.
	Par mad6! that s one way of putting
it, commented the apprentice; for
what mourners was there but mamselle
herself, and she as quiet as a mice and
not a teardrop, and all the island with
necks end to end for a look at her, and
you, master, whispering to her, The
Lord is the Giver and Taker, and the
femme de ballast tother side, saying,
My de-are, my de-are, bear thee up, bear
thee upthee?
	And she looking so steady in front
of her, as if never was shame about her
 and her there soon to be! and no
ring of gold upon her hand, and all
the world staring! broke in the mas-
ter, who, having now edged far off from
the cholera hammer, was launched upon
a theme that roused all his emotions.
All the world staring, and good rea-
son!
	And she scarce winking, eh?
	True, that! Her eyes did nt feel
the cold, said the master of burials with
a leer, for to his sight, as to that of oth-
ers, only as boldness had been Guidas
bitter courage, the numb, blank, despair-
ing gaze, coining from eyes that turned
their agony inward.
	What I want to know is, added the
master,  what I want to know is,
who was the man, bi~ sli?
	That s what none but they two knows,
and she says neither bouf ni baf, said
the apprentice. But it s none business
to we  nannin-cria!
	He took up the account again, and
prepared to read it. The master, how-
ever, had been awakened to a congenial
theme. Poor fallen child of nature! ~
said he. For what is birth or what is
looks of virtue like a summer flower!
It is to be brought down by hand of
man. He was warmed to his theme.
Habit had so long made him as much
hypocrite as his trade had made him
stony-hearted that he was at once senti-
mentalist and hard materialist. Some
pendloque has brought her beauty to
this pass, but she must suffer; and also
his time will come, the sulphur, the tor-
ment, the worm that dieth not  and no
Abraham for parched tongue  misery
me! They that meet in sin here shall
meet hereafter in burning fiery furnace.~~
	The cackle of the apprentice rose
above the whining voice: Murder, too,
 dont forget the murder, master. The
conn6table told the old Sieur de Mauprat
what people were blabbing, and in half-
hour dead he was  he!
The sieurs blood it is upon their
heads, continued the master of burials;
it will rise up from the ground 
The apprentice interrupted: A good
thing if the sieur himself does nt rise,
for you d get naught for coffin or the
obsquies. It was you tells the conn6table
what folks blabbed, and the conn6table
tells the sieur, and the sieur it kills him
dead. So if he rised, he d not pay
you for murdering him,  no, bidemme!
And this is a gobbly mouthful  this!
he added, holding up the bill.
	The undertakers lips smacked softly,
as though in truth he were waiting for
the mouthful. Rubbing his hands, and
drawing his lean leg up so that it touched
his nose, he looked over it with avid
eyes, and said, How much is it ? 
dont read the items, but come to~ total
debit,  how much is it? How much.
does she pay me?
Mamselle Landresse, debtor in all for one hun-
dred and twenty livres, eleven sols, and two
farthings.

	Shant we make it one hundred and
twenty-one livres? asked the appren-
tice.
	No; the odd sols and farthings look

better, returned the master of burials,
they look exact. But the courage it
needs to be honest! Oh my grief, if 
said the apprentice, pointing,
and the master of burials, turning, saw
Guida pass the doorway.
	With a hungry instinct for the morbid,
they stole to the doorway and looked
down the Rue dDri~re after Guida. The
master was sympathetic, for had he not
in his fingers a bill for a hundred and
twenty livres odd, at that moment? The
face of the apprentice was implacable,
but the way he craned his neck and
tightened the forehead over his large,
protuberant eyes showed his intense cu-
riosity. His face was like that of some
strong fate, superior to the influences of
mans sorrow, shame, or death. Pre-
sently he laughed,  a crackling cackle
like new-lighted kindling-wood; nothing
could have been more inhuman in sound.
What in particular aroused this arid
mirth probably he himself did not know.
Maybe it was a native cruelty which had
a sort of sardonic pleasure in the mis-
eries of the world. Or was it the one
perception sometimes given to the dull-
est mind, of the futility of goodness, the
futility of all? This is the kinder prob-
ability, for the apprentice was the new
companion of Dormy Jamais, and now
shared with him his rooms at the top of
the Cohue Royale; and certainly Dormy
Jamais was neither sardonic nor cruel.
In truth, there must have been some nat-
ural bond between the blank, sardonic
undertakers apprentice and the poor
b6ganne. Of late Dormy had haunted
the precincts of the Place du Vier Prison,
and was the only person besides Mal-
tresse Aimable whom Guida welcomed.
His tireless feet went cicte-clac past her
doorway, or halted by it, or entered in
when it pleased him. He was more a
watch-dog than Biribi; he fetched and
carried; he was silent and sleepless. It
was as if some past misfortune had
opened his eyes to the awful bitterness
of life, and they had never dosed again.
	The dry cackle of the apprentice as he
looked after Guida roused a mockery
of indignation in the master. Sacr6
matin, a back-hander on the jaw d do
you good, slubberdegullion  you! Ab,
get out, and scrub the coffin blacking
from your jowl!  he rasped out, with
furious contempt.
	The apprentice seemed not to hear,
but kept on looking after Guida, a piti-
less leer on his face. Et ben, lucky for
her the sieur died before he had chance
to change his will. She d have got ni
fiche ni bran from him!
	Holy jacks, if you dont stop that
I 11 give you a coffin before your time,
you keg of nails! Sorrow and prayer
at the throne of grace that she may have
a contrite heart  he clutched the fu-
neral bill tighter in his fingers  is
what all must feel for her. The day
the sieur died and it all came out, I
wept; bedtime come I had to sop my
eyes with elder-water. The day o the
burial mine eyes were so sore a-draining,
I had to put a rotten sweet apple on em
overnight  me!
	Ah bah! she does nt need rosemary
wash for her hair! said the apprentice
admiringly, looking down the street af-
ter Guida as she turned into the Rue
dEgypte, near the Vier Prison.
	Perhaps it was a momentary sympa-
thy for beauty in distress which made
the master say, as he backed from the
doorway stealthily, Gatden~de, t is
well she has enough to live on, and to
provide for what s to come!
	But if it was a note of humanity in
his voice it passed quickly, for presently,
as he examined the bill for the funeral
of the Sieur de Mauprat, he said to the
apprentice in a shrill voice, Achocre,
you ye left out the extra satin for his
pillow  you!
	There was nt any extra satin,
drawled the apprentice.
	With a snarl the master of burials
seized a pen and wrote in the account:
Item  to extra satin for pillow, three livres.</PB>

XXVIII.

	Gaidas once blithe, rose-colored face
was pale as ivory, the mouth had a look
of deep sadness, and the step was slow;
but the eye was clear and steady, and
her hair, brushed back under the black
crape of the bonnet as smoothly as its
nature would admit, gave to the broad
brow a setting of rare attraction and
sombre nobility. It was not a face that
knew inward shame, but it carried a look
that showed knowledge of lifes cruelties,
and a bitter sensitiveness to pain. It was,
however, fearless, and it had no touch of
the consciousness or the consequences of
sin ; it was purity itself.
	Her face alone should have pro-
claimed abroad her innocence, though
she had uttered no word in testimony.
To most people, nevertheless, her fearless
sincerity only added to her crime, and
increased the scandalous mystery. Yet
her manner awed some, and tier silence
held most back. The few who came to
offer sympathy, with rude curiousness
in their eyes and as much inhumanity as
pity in their hearts, were turned away,
gently but firmly, more than once with
proud resentment.
	So it chanced that soon only Maitresse
Aimable came, she who asked no ques-
tions, desired no secrets. The Cheva-
lier du Champsavoys had not been with
Guida, for on the afternoon of the very
day that her grandfather died he had
gone a secret voyage to St. Malo, to
meet the old solicitor of his family. He
knew nothing of his friends death or of
Guidas trouble.
	Nor yet did Maitre Ranuiph visit her
after the funeral of the Sieur de Mau-
prat. The horror of the thing had
struck him dumb, and his mind was one
confused mass of conflicting thoughts.
He believed in Guida utterly, but there
 there were the terrifying facts before
him. Yet, with an obstinacy peculiar to
him, he still went on believing in her
goodness and in her truth. Of the man
who had injured her he had no doubt,
and his mind was clear as to his course in
the hour when he and Philip dAvranche
should meet. But meanwhile, though
he seldom went near the Place du Vier
Prison, he visited Maitresse Aimable,
and from day to day he knew all that
happened to Guida. As of old, without
her knowledge, he did many things for
her through the same Maitresse Aimable.
It quickly came to be known in the island
that any one who spoke ill of Guida in his
presence did so at no little risk. At first
there had been those who marked him as
the culprit; but somehow that did not suit
with the case, for it was clear he loved
Guida now as he had always done, and
this all the world knew, and knew also
that he would have married her all too
gladly. Presently D6tricand and Philip
were the only names mentioned; final-
ly, as though by common consent, Philip
was settled upon, for such evidence as
there was pointed that way. The gossips
set about to recall all that had happened
when Philip was in Jersey last. Here
one came forward with tittle of truth, and
there another with tattle of falsehood,
and at last as wild a story was fabricat-
ed as might be heard in a long day.
	But the truth none of them knew, for
in bitterness Guida kept her own counsel.
	When she reached the cottage in the
Place du Vier Prison now, she took from
a drawer the letter Philip had written
her on the day he first met the Comtesse
Chantavoine. She had received it a
week before. She read it through slow-
ly, shuddering a little once or twice.
When she had finished reading, she
drew paper to her and began a letter.

	No, Philip dAvranche [she wrote],
your message came too late. All that
you might have said and done should
have been said and done long ago,  in
that past which I believe in no more. I
will not now ask you why, from the
first, you acted as you did toward me.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00288" SEQ="0288" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="282">	282	like Battle of the Strong.

Words can alter nothing now. Once I
thought you sincere, and this letter you
send me would have me believe so still.
Do you then think so poorly of my in-
telligence ?
	In spite of all your promises, in spite
of the surrender of an honest heart and
a good life to you, in spite of truth and
loyalty and love, ia spite of every call
of honor, you denied me  dared to
deny me  at the very time you wrote
me this letter.
	For the passing honors of this world
you set aside, first by secrecy, and then
by falsehood, the helpless girl to whom
you once swore faith and undying love.
You, who knew the open book of her
heart, you threw it in the dust. Of
course there is no wife? the Due de
Bercy said to you before the states of
Bercy. Of course, you answered.
Without pity you told your lie.
	Were you blind, that you did not see
the consequences? Did you not realize
the horror of it? Or were you so
wicked that you did not care? For I
know that before you wrote me this let-
ter, and afterward when you had been
made heir to the duchy, the Comtesse
Chantavoine was openly named by the
Due de Bercy for your wife.
	I understand all now, and I want you
clearly to know that I am no longer
the thoughtless, believing girl whom you
drew from her simple life to give her so
cruel a fate. Yesterday I was a child;
to-day  Oh, above all else, do you
think I can ever forgive you for having
kiiled the youth, the trust, the joy of
life that was in me! You have made
me old  old; for all the real youth in
me is gone forever. You have spoiled
for me forever my rightful share of the
joyous and the good. My heart is sixty,
though my body is not twenty. You
have killed the summer of my life; it is
winter with me, and I shall never see
another spring. How dared you rob me
of all that was my birthright, and give
me nothing, nothing in return?
	Do you remember how I begged you
not to make me marry you, but you
urged me, and because I loved you and
trusted you I did? How I entreated you
not to make me marry you secretly, and
you insisted, and, loving you, I did?
How I made you promise you would
leave me at the altar, and not see me un-
til you came again to claim me for your
wife openly, and you broke that pro-
mise? Do you remember?
	Do you remember that night in the
garden, when the wind came moaning
from the sea? Do you remember how
you took me in your arms, and even
while I listened to your tender and as-
suring words, in that moment  Ah, the
hurt and the wrong and the shame of
it! Afterward, in the strange confusion,
in the blind helplessness of my life, I
tried to say, But he loved me, and I
also tried to forgive you. Not realizing
your wickedness wholly, perhaps in time
I might have seemed to you to forgive,
and to make myself believe I did; but
understanding all now, I feel that in the
hour when you betrayed me, your own
wife, I really ceased to love you. The
death of love began then, and when at
last I knew you had denied me it was
buried forever.
	I must go on alone, deprived of all
that makes life bearable; it is for you
to keep on climbing higher by your van-
ity, your strength, and your deceit. But
yet I know that, however high you climb,
you will never find repose. The mem-
ory of a wronged woman will be with
you always. You will not exist for me,
you will not be even a memory; but even
against your will I shall always be part
of you,  of your brain, of your heart,
of your soul; for the haunting thought of
the innocence you wronged will be youl-
torment in your greatest hour. This is
not a threat; it is a prophecy.
	Your worst torment will be then; mine
has already been with me. When the
weight of my miseries first fell upon me
I thought that I must die. Why should</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00289" SEQ="0289" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="283">	The Battle of the Strong.	283

I live,  why should I not die? The sea
was near7 and it buries deep. I thought
of all the people that live on the great
earth, and I said to myself that the soul
of one poor girl could not count in it all,
	that it could concern no one but my-
self. It was all clear to me,  it was
certain that I must die. The end of it
all should be quietness and rest,  no
more aching heart, no more heavy feet,
no more sleepless eyes that look upon
the world as through a flame of fire.
	I live still, you see, not because I fear
to die, but because there came to me a
voice in the night which said, Is thy
life thine to give or to destroy? The
voice was clearer than my own thinking.
It told my heart that death by ones own
hand meant shame; and I understood
that to reach that peace I must drag un-
willing feet over the good name and
memory of my beloved dead. I remem-
bered my mother,  if you had remem-
bered her, perhaps you would have
guarded the gift of my love, and not
have trampled it under your feet,  I
remembered my mother, and so I live
on.	You live on, also, but your star has
fallen from the sky. I know that, for
I know what I might have been to you.
I was your good destiny, hut, like some
madman who destroys his child, you
dragged me from my quiet home, and
with rough denial left me helpless in
the highway. God sent my love to bless
you, but you have turned it on me as a
scourge. Your passion and your cow-
ardice have lost me all  and your losses
God will send you.
	There is but little more to say. If
it lies in my power, I shall never see you
again while I live. And you will not
wish it. Yes, in spite of your eloquent
letter lying here beside me, you will not
wish it, and you shall not expect it. I
am not your wife save by the law; and
little have you cared for law! Little, too,
would the law help you in this now, for
which you will rejoice. For the ease of
your mind I hasten to tell you why.
	First let me inform you that none
in this land knows me to be your wife.
Your letter to my grandfather never
reached him, and to this hour I have
held my peace. The clergyman who
married us is a prisoner among the
French, and the strong-box which held
the register of St. Michaels Church was
stolen. The one other witness, Mr.
Shoreham, your lieutenant, as you tell
me, went down with the Araminta. So
you are safe in your denial of me. For
me, I am firmly set to live my own life,
in my own way, with what strength I
can. A few short months ago I thought
that the love I knew would never change
through time or tears. Time has not
changed it, but the tears which are my
portion have. At last I see beyond the
Hedge; and now I would endure all the
tortures of earth and time rather than
call you husband ever again.
	Your course is clear. You cannot turn
hack now; you have gone too far. Your
new honors and titles were got at the last
by a coarse lie. To acknowledge the lie
would be ruin, for all the world knows
that Commander Philip dAvranche of
the Kings Navy is now the adopted son
of the Prince dAvranche, Due de Bercy,
second in succession to his serene high-
ness. Surely the house of Bercy has cause
for joy, with an imbecile for the first in
succession, and a traitor for the second!
	I return herewith the fifty pounds you
sent me,  you will not question why.
	- . And so all ends. This is a last
farewell between us. Henceforth my
life is my own. Do you remember what
you said to me on the Ecr6hos? If ever
I deceive you, may I die a black, dis-
honorable death, abandoned and alone!
I should deserve that if ever I deceived
you, Guida. Think of that, in your
vain glory hereafter.

CRAVEN.

(MOBILE BAY, 1864.)


OVER the turret, shut in his ironclad tower,
	Craven was conning his ship through smoke and flame;
Gun to gun he had battered the fort for an hour,
	Now was the time for a charge to end the game.

There lay the narrowing channel, smooth and grim,
A hundred deaths beneath it, and never a sign;
There lay the enemys ships, and sink or swim
	The flag was flying, and he was head of the line.

The fleet behind was jamming: the monitor hung
	Beating the stream; the roar for a moment hushed;
Craven spoke to the pilot; slow she swung;
	Again he spoke, and right for the foe she rushed.

Into the narrowing channel, between the shore
	And the sunk torpedoes lying in treacherous rank;
She turned but a yard too short; a muffled roar,
	A mountainous wave, and she rolled, righted, and sank.

Over the manhole, up in the ironclad tower,
	Pilot and captain met as they turned to fly:
The hundredth part of a moment seemed an hour,
For one could pass to be saved, and one must die.

They stood like men in a dream; Craven spoke, 
Spoke as he lived and fought, with a captains pride:
After you, Pilot. The pilot woke,
	Down the ladder he went, and Craven died.

All men praise the deed and the manner; but we 
We set it apart from the pride that stoops to the proud,
The strength that is supple to serve the strong and free,
The grace of the empty hands and promises loud.

Sidney thirsting a humbler need to slake,
	Nelson waiting his turn for the surgeons hand,
Lucas crushed with chains for a comrades sake,
	Outram coveting right before command:

These were paladins, these were Cravens peers,
	These with him shall be crowned in story and song,
Crowned with the glitter of steel and the glimmer of tears,
	Princes of courtesy, merciful, proud, and strong.

NEPTUNJAN.

MIDWAY the height of one sheer granite rock
I sat in face of the barbarian sea,
And heard the god, out of the dreadful, deep,
Midmost Atlantic summoning strength, and here,
In accents clear above the sullen roar
Of all his waves, condemn the jutting world.

Populous Egypt was a realm and ruled
By men that strove when Greece was yet unborn.
I strive not, yet is Pharaoh deep in death,
And still the seas sweep unappeased and new.
Kings were ere Priam. Knew ye not? I hold
The substance, in my swift and solvent brine,
Of all the race since Adam, and of strange,
Unfeatured men ere Paradise. And I
Sang to them all, and cradled them, and drank
Their breath, their dust, their family and fame.
Earth the grain-giver in my hands I hold,
And if I will I love, and if I will
Hate, and I know no master hut the sun,
Who drinks the years up in a thin blue flame.
From me the rivers and the rain from me
Lead down their due-returning silver streams
In circuit just; and all the gulfs are mine
Beneath the earth that echo of the deep.
Laugh, then, be glad! Een though I swallow down,
To rock upon my oozy floor, the hulls
Of odd ten thousand hurrying ships. They swell
And mantle oer with all the amorous life
Ye reck not of, and in a year are gone.
Laugh and he glad! Tremble and fear! I beat
Beneath the shining forward of the dawn,
The dim high noon, and the red stars at night,
Daylight and dark forever I heat, I heat,
Indefatigably reiterant,
The bulwarks of the shore, daylight and dark,
With the blue night about me, and the dawn.

On billow billow rolling, in the press
Confounded of the furious, following surge,
Thunders the Deep, intolerant and sublime;
Gray-heart and grim to spurn of this black rock
The temerarious front, and here to wrench
The frame of earth aside before the sea.

		OLD BROIDERIES.
	I.

OUT of the carven chest of treasured things,
	That holds them dark and breathless, like a tomb,
	I lift these scriptured songs of many a loom
That labors now no longer,  nay, nor sings.
And one by one, their soft unfolding brings
	Along the air some touch of ghostly bloom;
	The tacit reminiscence of perfume,
The uncomplaining dust of mouldered springs.

Whether it be from hues, once richly bled
	Of rooted flowers, some magic takes the sense,
Or if it be that meek aroma, wed
	To flush and sheen and shadow, shaken thence,
Or clinging touch of aging silken thread,
	They hold me, with a tongueless eloquence.


II.

I marvel how the broiderers could find
	So sweet the summer shapes that never fade,
	Though some mere passing race of man and maid
Have paled and wasted and gone down the wind!
Yet here the toilful art of one could bind
	No dream with tenderer woven light and shade,
	Than sovran bloom and fruitage, rare arrayed,
Or listless tendrils idly intertwined.

Ah, bitter-sweet! For caged care to slake
	Its thirst with joyance of the weed that grows, 
The whim of leaf and leaf, and petal flake,
	Whatever way the breath of April blows:
And poor, wise, withered hands, with skill to make
The red unhuman gladness of the rose!


IT.

There is a certain damask here, moon-pale,
	With the wan iris of a snow on snow,
	Or petal against petal cheek, ablow.
It wears its glories bridelike under veil;
But shadowed, half, the blanch~d folds exhale
Sweet confidence of color: and there grow 
Entwined and sundered, by the gloom and glow 
Dim vines, to muse upon till fancy fail.</PB></P>

DEMOCRACY.

Oun mighty bark, with masts that rake the stars,
Has lagged too long in port, and we have drowsed
An idle crew or with wild mates caroused,
Forgetful of our part in Freedoms wars.
But now, at last, with sail taut to the spars,
For her whose rightful cause our sires espoused,
Again our ship must steer where blow unhoused
The winds of God, beyond the shoals and bars.
For still our orders hold, as in the past, 
That glorious day we shook our banner free,
And broke from out the line and took the van,
With linstocks lit, and bade them follow fast,
Who held with us,  to sail and search the sea
Until we find a better world for man.

AFTER THE DAYS BUSINESS.

WHEN I sit down with thee at last alone,
Shut out the wrangle of the clashing day,
The scrape of petty jars that fret and fray,
The snarl and yelp of brute beasts for a bone, 
When thou and I sit down at last alone,
And through the dusk of rooms divinely gray
Spirit to spirit finds its voiceless way
As tone melts meeting in accordant tone,
Oh, then our souls far in the vast of sky
Look from a tower too high for sound of strife
Or any violation of the town,
Where the great vacant winds of God go by,
And over the huge misshapen city of life
Love pours his silence and his moonlight down.
Richard Hovey.




NIGHT.

DEEP in the starry silence of the night
Breathes low the mystery of Life and Death,
While oer the darkened waters wandereth
A voiceless spirit, veiled from mortal sight.
Upheld, enfolded in the encircling height
Of heaven, the hushed Earth softly draws her breath,
And in the holy stillness listeneth
To sweeping wings of far-off worlds in flight.
Beauty ascends in elemental prayer:
Lifted in worship, lost in wonderment,
I join in Natures night antiphony
That vibrates in the calm and sentient air;
And through the veil of darkness am content
To touch the garment of Eternity.

UNPUBLISHED LETTERS OF CARLYLE.

I.

	THE letters of which the first install-
ment is herewith printed were in great
part written by Thomas Carlyle to his
youngest sister, Mrs. Robert Hanning,
who died in Toronto, December 13,1897.
Other members of the family are repre-
sented in the correspondence: there are
a number of letters  these perhaps the
most interesting  from Carlyle to his
mother; and a few from the mother to
her oldest and to her youngest child.
The collection extends from 1832 to
1890, when Mr. John Carlyle Aitken
wrote to inform his aunt, Mrs. Hanning,
of the death of James Carlyle, her young-
est brother.
	Mrs. Hanning (Janet Carlyle) was
born, as were all her brothers and sis-
ters before her, in the village of Eccle-
fechan, in a house, still standing, which
their father had built with his own hands.
The following notes of her life are sup-
plied by her son-in-law, the Rev. George
M. Franklin : 
She was reckoned the neatest seam-
stress of the family, and received the
rare compliment of praise from her eld-
est brother (Thomas Carlyle) for hav-
ing done excellent work on some shirts.
Robert Hanning, an old friend of the
Carlyles, going to the same school with
Janet, and looking on the same book,
wooed and won her. They were mar-
ried at Scotsbrig, on March 15~ 1836.
They went to Manchester, England, to
live, as Mr. Hanning was employed by a
Mr. Craig, and subsequently was a part-
ner in the business. This business hav-
ing proved unprofitable, they returned to
Scotland, and Mr. Hanning entered into
business with his brother Peter as part-
ner. This proved also a failure. Soon
afterward the family went back to Dum-
fries. Mr. Hanning sailed for Amer-
ica, arriving at New Ysrk ~ and after
working there for a time left that city
for Hamilton, Ontario, his future home.
Mrs. Hanning and her two children re-
mained in Dumfries, although she had
wished much to go with her husband and
share his fortunes. Thomas persuaded
her, against her judgment, as she has
said, to wait until her husband was set-
tled. Mr. Hanning was a man of strong
convictions and the highest moral prin-
ciple. The reunion of his family was
effected in 1851~ when the wife and two
daughters left Glasgow in a sailing-vessel,
the passage to Quebec occupying about
seven weeks. Then taking a steamer
from Quebec, th0y reached Hamilton in
good time. This was before the building
of the Great Western Railway. Mrs.
Hanning soon made a home for her de-
voted husband, earning the commenda-
tion brave little sister. Mr. Hanning
entered the service of the Great West-
ern Railway of Canada in 1853, and
remained with that company until his
death, which occurred March 12, 1878.
	An indispensable guide to the corre-
spondence will be found in the following
list, given by Professor Norton, of the
children of James Carlyle, with the dates</PB>

of their births: Thomas, born December
4, 1795 (died at Chelsea February 5,
1881); Alexander, born August 4,1797;
Janet, born September 2, 1799; John
Aitken, born July 7, 1801; Margaret,
born September 20, 1803; James, born
November 12, 1805; Mary, born Febru-
ary 2, 1808; Jean, born September 2,
1810; Janet (Mrs. Hanning) born July
18, 1813.
	Among the persons mentioned by Mr.
Franklin as visiting Mrs. Hanning, the
most distinguished was Emerson, who
went to Hamilton in the summer of
1865. Mr. Emerson placed her in a
chair near the window, so that he might
the more readily examine her features,
and, looking into her eyes, exclaimed,
And so this is Carlyles little sister!
	Mention of the youngest stay of the
house, little Jenny, is rare and slight
in the published letters and memorials
of Carlyle. Froude, in an ingeniously
careless passage, confuses her with an
older sister, Jean. He speaks of the
youngest child of all, Jane, called the
Craw, or Crow, from her black hair.
Carlyle, on pages 92 and 93 of the sec-
ond volume of the Reminiscences,  in
Mr. Nortons edition,  mentions both
Jean and Jenny: There was a young-
er and youngest sister (Jenny), who is
now in Canada; of far inferior specu-
lative intellect to Jean, but who has
proved to have (we used to think) su-
perior housekeeping faculties to hers.
	My prayers and affection are with
you all, from little Jenny upwards to
the head of the house, writes Carlyle
to his mother on October 19, 1826, af-
ter a form common enough, with its va-
riations, in his early letters. Occasion-
ally she has done something to be noted.
On October 20, 1827: Does Jenny
bring home her medals yet? On No-
vember 15: Does Jenny still keep her
medals? Tell her that I still love her,
and hope to find her a good lassie and
to do her good. In the spring of 1828
Carlyle writes from Scotsbrig to his
Dear Little Craw in Edinburgh:
Mag and Jenny are here; Jenny at the
Sewing.school with Jessie Combe, and
making great progress. Mrs. Carlyle
adds, in a postscript to an 1835 letter to
Mrs. Aitken: Carlyle has the impu-
dence to say he forgot to send his com-
pliments to Jenny; as if it were possible
for any one acquainted with that morsel
of perfections to forget her! Tell her
I will write a letter with my own hand,
and hope to see her an ornament to so-
ciety in every direction. In a preface
 written many years after to a letter
to Jean Carlyle, bearing date November,
1825, and signed Jane Baillie Welsh,
Carlyle explains: This Jean Carlyle
is my second youngest sister, then a little
child of twelve. The youngest sister,
youngest of us all, was Jenny [Janet],
now Mrs. Robert Hanning, in Hamil-
ton, Canada West. These little beings,
in their bits of grey speckled [black and
white] straw bonnets, I recollect as a
pair of neat, brisk items, tripping about
among us that summer at the Hill.
Letter and preface are given by Froude,
as is also a letter from Carlyle to his
wife, dated Scotsbrig, May 3, 1842, and
ending thus: Yesterday I got my bair
cropped, partly by my own endeavours
in the front, chiefly by sister Jennys in
the rear. I fear you will think it rather
an original cut.
	In 1827: Tell her that I still love
her, and hope to find her a good lassie and
to do her good; in 1873, in Carlyles
last letter to Mrs. Hanning written with
his own hand: I please myself with
the thought that you will accept this lit-
tle New Years Gift from me as a sign
of my unalterable affection, whh, tho it
is obliged to be silent (unable to write as
of old), cannot fade away until I my-
self do! Of that be always sure, my
dear little Sister; and that if in anything
I can be of help to you or yours, I right
willin~gly will.
	All the letters that follow are strung
on a slender thread of biography. Even</PB>

readers who know their Carlyle thor-
oughly may like to see, from year to
year and from page to page, the con-
trast between his life in the world and
his life with the peasant kindred who
were so far from everything that men
call the world. And although nothing
in these letters will add to our know-
ledge of Carlyle, they cannot  taken
together  fail to touch us freshly with
the sense of what he was to his people,
and what they were to him.
	Carlyles life until 1832, the year of
the first letter, may be most briefly sum-
marized. The son of James Carlyle, a
stone-mason, he was horn at Ecciefechan,
in a room inconceivably small, on the
4th of December, 1795. He went to
school at Annan, and, in 1809, to the
University of Edinburgh. Five years
later he returned to the Annan school as
a teacher of mathematics, and in 1816
went to Kirkcaldy to teach the same sub-
ject. After an experience of literary
hack work in Edinburgh, which began
when he was twenty-three years old, he
became tutor in the Buller family. A
long, strange, and ill - boding courtship
ended, on the 17th of October, 1826, in
his marriage with Jane Baillie Welsh.
She had a small inherited estate at Crai-
genputtock, high up on the moors, and
sixteen miles from Dumfries; and there,
two years after their marriage, they went
to live for six years more. In 1831 and
1832 they were trying their wings in
London.
	Mrs. Welsh was Mrs. Carlyles
mother. Maister Cairlill was a fre-
quent name for Carlyles brother James.
The family had been living at Scotsbrig
since 1826. Carlyle was thirty - seven
years old, and his sister nineteen, when
the following letter was written.

I.	CARLYLE TO JANET cARLYLE, scoTsnRIG.

AMPTON ST., LONDON,
23rd January, 1832.

	M~ DEAR JENNY,  Will you put up
with the smallest of letters rather than
with none at all? I have hardly a mo-
ment, and no paper but this thick, coarse
sort.
	Understand always, My dear Sister,
that I love you well, and am very glad
to see and hear that you conduct your-
self as you ought. To you also, my little
lassie, it is of infinite importance how
you behave: were you to get a Kingdom,
or twenty Kingdoms, it were but a piti-
ful trifle compared with this, whether you
walked as God command you, and did
your duty to God and to all men. You
have a whole Life before you, to make
much of or to make little of: see you
choose the better part, my dear little
sister, and make yourself and all of us
pleased with you. I will add no more,
but commend you from the heart (as
we should all do one another) to Gods
keeping. May He ever bless you! I
am too late, and must not wait another
minute. We have this instant had a long
letter from Mrs. Welsh, full of kind-
ness to our Mother and all of you. The
Cheese, &#38; c., &#38; c., is faithfully commemo-
rated as a noble one; Mary is also
made kind mention of. You did all very
right on that occasion. Mrs. Welsh says
she must come down to Scotsbrig and see
you all. What will you think of that?
Her Father, in the meantime, is very
ill, and gives her incessant labour and
anxiety.
	See to encourage Jean to write, and do
you put your hand a little to the work.
What does Maister Cairlill think of the
last letter he wrote us? Was it not a
letter among many? He is a graceless
man. I send you a portrait of one of
our Chief Radicals here: it is said to be
very like.
I remain always, My dear Sister,
Your affectionate
T.	CARLYLE.


	On January 24,  Froude gives the
date wrongly as the 26th,  the day
after the date of this letter, Carlyle,
still in London, heard of the death of</PB>

his father, at the age of seventy-three.
He wrote immediately to his mother in
terms which place the letter high even
among his letters; and in less than a
week he had uttered the wail of genius
that stands first in the Reminiscences,
 a book which has no language but
a cry. By April he was back again at
Craigenputtock, where it was so still that
poor Mrs. Carlyle could hear the sheep
nibbling a quarter of a mile away.
Carlyle had now a new grief in the
death of Goethe, who, making of him
a disciple, had left him a teacher on
his own account. The loss of Goethe
found a measurable compensation in cor-
respondence with Mill, who had been
kindled into something very like firp by
Carlyles review of Crokers Boswell,
just published in Frasers Magazine. It
is one of the greatest of Carlyles briefer
performances, although written at short
notice. Carlyle, said his wife, always
writes well when he writes fast. rrlis
essay, indeed, has a high place in the
development of an idea which may be
stated as Crokers Boswell, Macaulays
Boswell, Carlyles Boswell, and  Bos-
well.
	There followed now essays on Goethe
and Ebenezer Elliotts Corn Law Rhymes
(Carlyles last contribution to the Edin-
burgh Review), and a highly important
article on IDiderot for the Foreign Quar-
terly. In the autumn of 1832, Carlyle
notes that the money from the essay
on Goethe has gone in part payment of
Jeffreys loan, that Craigenputtock has
grown too lonely even for him, and that
his literary plans demand a library. Not
only must the work on Diderot have as-
sured him of his ability to fuse and weld
the most stubborn materials, but it opened
his eyes to the French Revolution as a
subject for his pen. Moved, then, by
weariness of the solitude ~t deux among
the peat moss, and by this new purpose
in writing, the twain removed to Edin-
burgh toward the end of 1832.
	Four months of Edinburgh were
enough to convince Carlyle that here
was for him no continuing city; enough,
also, to enable him to collect and carry
back to Craigenputtock the substance of
The Diamond Necklace, one of the best
of his tragi-comic pieces.
	The loneliness of the whinstone
stronghold on the moors was cheered
in the following August by Emersons
memorable visit. We went out to
walk over long hills, writes Emerson in
English Traits, and looked at Criffel,
then without his cap, and down into
Wordsworths country. There we sat
down and talked of the immortality of
the soul.
	The essay on Cagliostro, written in
March, 1833, was printed in Frasers
Magazine for July and August; and
Fraser agreed to publish Sartor Resar-
tus in the next volume,  only fining Car-
lyle eight guineas a sheet for his ori-
ginality. This gadfly tax on genius;
the Foreign Quarterlys refusal of The
Diamond Necklace, patently a master-
piece though it was; Jeffreys refusal
to recommend Carlyle for a profes-
sorship of astronomy; and, climactical-
ly, the defection of one of those maids
whose misdemeanors continue a servile
war through so many of the Carlyle
chronicles, directed Carlyles gaze to-
ward what Johnson thought the fairest
prospect ever spread before a Scotchman.
Emerson had observed that he was al-
ready turning his eyes towards London
with a scholars appreciation, and at
last, on the 25th of February, 1834, Car-
lyle wrote to his brother John: We
learned incidentally last week that Grace,
our servant, though without fault to us,
and whom we, with all her inertness, were
nothing but purposing to keep, had re-
solved on going home next summer.
The cup that had long been filling ran
over with the smallest of drops. After
meditating on it for a few minutes, we
said to one another: Why not bolt out
of all these sooty despicabilities, of Ker-
rags and lying draggle - tails of byre</PB>

women, and peat-moss and isolation and
exasperation and confusion, and go at
once to London? Gedctcht, fj,ethctn!
Two days after we had a letter on the
road to Mrs. Austin, to look out among
the houses to let for us, and an ad-
vertisement to Mac Diarmid to try for
the letting of our own. Cattle, poul-
try, and various superfluities, were sold.
Carlyle went on ahead, and was guided
by the airy steps of Leigh Hunt, then a
dweller in Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea,
to the house Number 5, Great Cheyne
Row, which the new tenants soon made
interesting to much of what was best in
London (to much, also, Mrs. Oliphant
has taken pains to say, of what was not
the best), and eventually to the English-
speaking world. The house was not taken
until Mrs. Carlyle had inspected and ap-
proved it. A few days after the 10th
of June, the date of their installation,
Carlyle wrote to his mother: We lie
safe at a bend of the river, away from
all the great roads; have air and quiet
hardly inferior to Craigenputtock, an
outlook from the back windows into mere
leafy regions, with here and there a red
high-peaked old roof looking through;
and see nothing of London, except by
day the summits of St. Pauls Cathedral
and Westminster Abbey, and by night
the gleam of the great Babylon affront-
ing the peaceful skies. The house it-
self is probably the best we have ever
lived in, a right old, strong, roomy brick-
house, built near one hundred and fifty
years ago, and likely to see three races
of these modern fashionables fall before
it comes down. It all sounds like a
sunny backwater, but in truth the Car-
lyles had taken a very bold plunge into
the world-sea. Their reserve of money
could have been, at the utmost, no more
than three hundred pounds; and the
only personal sign of the times for them
was the fact that the writer of Sartor
 now coming out in chapters  was
thought a literary maniac, and that Fra-
ser feared the ruin of his magazine.
	The household gods, however, once
templed in Cheyne Row, were never car-
ried back across the Border; nor, in
fact, were they, in the half-century of
life that remained to Carlyle, removed
to any other spot. Here he caught the
last glimpse of Edward Irving, the friend
of his youth; here he welcomed Sterling,
	a new young figure, the closest friend
of his middle life; and hither came to
him Froude and Ruskin, his latest fol-
lowers.
	At first, in the chosen habitation,
it was desperate hope and bitter
thrift. The readers of Frasers Mag-
azine received Sartor each month with
renewed disgust. Sartor, said the
publisher, excites universal disappro-
bation. While this passionate history
of a soul, with its motive so strangely
drawn from the Holy Bible and the
great, unholy Dean, was waiting to touch
the slow spirit of the British reading
public, Carlyle  taking counsel of his
necessities, his ambition, and his inspira-
tions  applied himself to the history of
the French Revolution. The first vol-
ume  as all the world knows  was
lent in manuscript to Mill, who lent it
to Mrs. Taylor, his veevid and in-
descent Egeria, whose servant kindled
fires with it. Carlyle had not been of-
fered, as he thought he should have
been, the editorship of the new London
and Westminster Review; and Mill, for
fear of his father, did not dare even to
give him work to do for it. Carlyle him-
self had refused to sell his independence
to the Times. There was thus nothing
for it hut to rewrite the burnt volume,
of which he had kept no notes. With
such vigor did he drive his mind and his
pen that the lost chapters were restored
by September 22, 1835. Mill had told
him of the loss on the 6th of the preced-
ing March. Mrs. Carlyle wrote to her
sister-in-law, Mrs. Aitken, in August:
I do not think that the second version
is, on the whole, inferior to the first; it
is a little less vivacious, perhaps, but bet-</PB>

ter thought and put together. One chap-
ter more brings him to the end of his sec-
ond first volume, and then we shall sing
a Te Deum and get drunk; for which,
by the way, we have unusual facilities at
present, a friend (Mr. Wilson) having
yesterday sent us a present of a hamper
(some six or seven pounds worth) of the
finest old Madeira wine.
	Better yet than wine was an American
edition of Sartor, godfathered by Em-
erson, to the number of five hundred
copies. This was in April, 1836, and an-
other edition was soon demanded. Car-
lyle amused himself by quoting Sartor,
in his essay on Mirabeau, as the work of
a New England writer.
	The Doctor, mentioned in the let-
ter to follow, was Carlyles brother
John, who, thanks to Jeffrey, had been
for some years traveling physician to
Lady Clare. Anne Cook was an An-
nandale servant whom Carlyle brought
with him on his return from Scotsbrig,
in October, 1835. Mrs. Carlyle wrote
of Anne Cook, She amuses me every
hour of the day with her perfect incom-
prehension of everything like ceremo-
ny; and several of her homespun say-
ings became proverhs in Cheyne Row.
Short, ns Carlyle uses it in writing to
his sister, has apparently the meaning
often attached to it in New England, 
short of temper. The whole sentence
bears a quizzing reference to the year
before, when, on the 4th of June, Car-
lyle had written: Alick, writing to me
yesterday, mentions among other things
that you are shorted (as he phrases it)
because I have not written. - . . Do
not you shorten, my dear little Bairn,
but lengthen, and know that if you take
anything amiss, it is for mere want of
seeing how it really was; that of all de-
lusions Satan could tempt you with, that
of wanting my brotherly affection, now
and always while we inhabit the Earth
together, is the most delusive. And on
the 23d of December: Do not shorten,
but lengthen.
	The second volume is, of course,
the second volume of The French Re-
volution. Of both first and second Car-
lyle had written more vehemently to
Emerson, a few weeks before: I got
the fatal First Volume finished (in the
miserablest way, after great efforts) in
October last; my head was all in a
whirl; I fled to Scotland and my Mother
for a mouth of rest. Rest is nowhere for
the Son of Adam; all looked so spec-
tral to me in my old-familiar Birth-
land; Hades itself could not have seemed
stranger; Annandale also was part of the
kingdom of Time. Since November I
have worked again as I could; a second
volume got wrapped up and sealed out
of my sight within the last three days.
There is but a Third now: one pull
more, and then! It seems to me, I will
fly into some obscurest cranny of the
world, and lie silent there for a twelve.
month. The mind is weary, the body
is very sick; a little black speck dances
to and fro in the left eye (part of the
retina protesting against the liver, and
striking work). I cannot help it; it must
flutter and dance there, like a signal of
distress, unanswered till I be done. My
familiar friends tell me farther that the
Book is all wrong, style, cramp, &#38; c., &#38; c.
My friends, I answer, you are very
right; but this also, Heaven be my wit-
ness, I cannot help.  In such sort do I
live here; all this I had to write you, if
I wrote at all.
	The contrast between such a passage
and the whole letter to his sister is but
one of a multitude of instances that show
the change in Carlyles spirit whenever
he sat down to write to his home people.

IL cAELvLE To MRS. MANNING, MANCHESTER.

5 CHEYNE Row, CHELSEA, LoNDoN,
16th May, 18~6.
	M~ DEAR JENNY,  Your letter has
been here several weeks, a very welcome
messenger to us, and I did not think at
the time I should have been so long in
answering it. But I have been drawn</PB>

hither and thither by many things, of
late; besides, I judged that Robert and
you were happy enough of yourselves
for the present, and did not much need
any foreign aid or interruption. I need
not assure you, my dear little Jenny, of
the interest I took in the great enterprise
you had embarked on; of my wishes
and prayers that it might prove for the
good of both. On the whole, I can say
that, to my judgment, it looks all very
fair and well. You know I have all along
regarded Hanning as an uncommonly
brisk, glegg little fellow since the first
time I saw him (hardly longer than my
leg, then), and prophesied handsome
things of him in the world. It is very
rare and very fortunate when two par-
ties that have affected each other from
childhood upwards get together in in-
dissoluble partnership at last. May it
prove well for you, as I think it will.
You must take the good and the ill in
faithful mutual help, and, whoever or
whatever fail you, never fail one another.
I have no doubt Robert will shift his
way with all dexterity and prudence
thro that Cotton Babylon, looking sharp
about him; knowing always, too, that
honesty is the best policy for all man-
ner of men. Do thou faithfully second
him, my bairn: that will be the best of
lots for thee.
	I think it possible that now and then,
especially when you are left alone, the
look of so many foreign things may
seem dispiriting to you, and the huge
smoke and stour of that tumultuous Man-
chester (which is not unlike the uglier
parts of London) produce quite other
than a pleasant impression. But take
courage, my woman, you will use,
you will use, and get hefted to the
place, as all creatures do. There are
many good people in that vast weaving-
shop, many good things among the in-
numerable bad. Keep snug within your
own doors, keep your own hearth snug;
by and by you will see what is worth
venturing out for. Have nothing to do
with the foolish, with the vain and ill-
conducted. Attach yourself to the well
living and sensible, to every one from
whom you find there is real benefit deriv-
able. Thus, by degrees a desirable little
circle will form itself around you; you
will feel that Manchester is a home, as
all places under the heavenly sun here
may become for one.
	In a newspaper you would notice that
the Doctor was come. Till this day,
almost, there was little else to be said
about him than that he was here and well.
He has been speculating and enquiring
as to what he should do, and now has
determined that London practice will
not do for the present; that he should
go back with his Lady and try again to
get practice there. He is gone out this
moment to make a bargain to that effect.
They are to set out for Rome again on
the first of September; from that till the
first of March the Doctor is Lady Clares
doctor, but lives in his own lodging at
Rome; after that he is free to do what-
soever he will: to stay there, if they
seem inviting; to return home, if other-
wise. I believe, myself, that he has de-
cided wisely. Till September, then, we
have him amongst us. He talks of be-
ing off in a week or two for Scotland;
he charged me to say that he would
see Manchester, and you, either as he
went or as he returned. It is not much
out of the way, if one go by Carlisle
(or rather, I suppose, it is directly in
the way), or even if one go by Liver-
pool, but I rather think he will make
for Newcastle this time; to which place
we have a steamboat direct. This is a
good season for steamboats, and a bad
one for coaches; for with latter, indeed,
what good season is there? Nothing
in the world is frightfuller to me of the
travelling rout, than a coach on a long
journey. It is easier by half to walk it
with peas (at least boiled peas) in your
shoes, were not the time so much short-
er. The Doctor looks very well and
sonsy; he seems in good health and well</PB>

to live; the only change is that his head
is getting a shade of grey (quite ahead
of mine, though I am six years older),
which does not mis-seem him, but looks
very well.
	We had a long speculation about go-
ing to Scotland, too, but I doubt we
must renounce it. This summer I have
finished my second volume, but there is
still the third to do, and I must have
such a tussle with it! All summer I
will struggle and wrestle, but then about
the time of the gathering in of sheaves
I too shall be gathering in. Jane has
gone out to buy a cotton gown, for
the weather is, at last, beautiful and
warm. Before going she bade me send
you both her best wishes and regards,
prayers for a happy pilgrimage together.
She has been but poorly for a good
while (indeed, all the world is sick with
these east winds and perpetual changes),
but will probably be better now.
	Jack and I, too, have both had our
colds. Then Anne Cook fell sick, al-
most dangerously sick for the time; but
Jack was there and gave abundant med-
ical help; so the poor creature is on her
feet again, and a great trouble of con-
fusion is rolled out of doors thereby.
	I am writing to our Mother this day.
I have heard nothing from that quarter
since the letter that informed me the
poor little child was dead. Jean wrote
part of it herself,and seemed in a very
composed state, keeping her natural sor-
row courageously down. Our Mother,
I believe, continues there till Jean be
ill again, and we hope happily well.
Whether there be a frank procurable
to-day I know not, but I will try. At
worst I will not wait, lest you grow im-
patient again and get short. If you
knew what a fizz I am kept in with one
thing and another! Write to me when
you have time to fill a sheet,  news,
descriptions of how you get on, what
you suffer and enjoy, what you do: these
are the best. I will answer. Send an
old newspaper from time to time, with
two strokes on it, if you are well. Pro-
mise, however, to write instantly if you
are ill. Then shall we know to keep
ourselves in peace.
	Farewell, dear little Sister. Give our
love to our new Brother. Tell him to
walk wisely and be a credit to your
choice. God be with you both.
T.	CARLYLE.


	In Carlyles journal for June 1 occur
these words: 
An eternity of life were not endur-
able to any mortal. To me the thought
of it were madness even for one day.
Oh! I am far astray, wandering, lost,
dyeing the thirsty desert with my blood
in every footprint. Perhaps God and
His providence will be better to me than
I hope. Peace, peace! words are idler
than idle.
	~ I have seen Wordsworth again. I
have seen Landor, Americans, French-
man-Cavaignac the Republican. Be no
word written of them. Bubble bubble,
toil and trouble. I find emptiness and
chagrin, look for nothing else, and on
the whole can reverence no existing
man, and shall do well to pity all, my-
self first,  or rather, last. To work,
therefore. That will still me a little, if
aught will.
	Presently the household purse be-
came so shrunken that the Revolution
had to be dropped for two weeks, while
Carlyle wrote the article on Mirabeau.
This  printed first in Mills Review,
and afterward in the Miscellanies 
brought in about fifty pounds. Mrs.
Carlyle, meanwhile, became so ill that
it was arranged for her to go home to
her mother. The voyage part of the
plan,  by steamer from Liverpool to
Annan,  which had been merely for
economy, was not carried out. Mrs.
Carlyles Liverpool uncle, John Welsh,
paid her fare in the coach to Dumfries,
and gave her a handsome shawl as a
present for her birthday, the 14th of
July.</PB>

III.	CARLYLE TO MRS. HANNING, MANCHESTER.
CHELSEA, 8th July, Friday, 1836.

	DEAR JENNY,  I write you a few
words in the greatest haste, with a wor-
thy Mr. Gibson even talking to me all
the while; but I must write, for there is
not a post to lose, and I think the news
will not be unwelcome to you.
	Jane is getting ill again in this fiercely
hot weather, and I have persuaded her
to go home for a month to her mother.
She is going by Manchester, and you.
Off some time to - morrow (Saturday),
and will be in your town, we calculate,
on Sunday, and hopes to sleep in your
house that night. This is the news.
Now we know not as yet by what coach
she will come, or at what hour and what
Inn she will arrive, but this Mr. Gibson,
who has undertaken to go out and search
over the city for the suitablest vehicle,
and to engage a seat in that for her, will
take this letter in his pocket. He, hav-
ing engaged the seat, will mark the name
of it on the outside (where see). I
judge farther that this letter will reach
you on Saturday evening or next morn-
ing soon, so that there will be time.
The rest you will know how to do with-
out telling. I think Robert, if he be
not altered from what he was, will suc-
ceed in meeting the tired wayfarer as
she steps out, which will be a great com-
fort to her. She calculates on being at
full liberty to sit silent with you, or to
sit talking, to lie down on the bed, to do
whatsoever she likes best to do, and to
be in all senses at home as in her own
home. There are few houses in Eng-
land that could do as much for her. I
think she would like best to be well
let alone.
	Next day, or when once right rested,
Robert will conduct her to the Liverpool
Railway, and give her his Luck by the
road;  after which she has but a little
whirl, a little sail,  by the force of
steam both ways,  and is at Templand
or Annan. She will tell you all our news
and get all yours, so I need not add an-
other word. Did you get a frank that
I sent you some months ago? Did you
ever send even a newspaper since?
Jane has half a thought that she may
find the Doctor and our mother with
you. All good wishes to your Goodman.
	Yours, my dear Jenny, affectionately,
T.	CARLYLE.


iv.	TO MRS. HANNING, MANCHESTER, FROM
HER MOTHER, IN SCOTSHRIG.
November 3, 1836.
	DEAR JENNY,  I have long had a
mind to write you, but have put off, as you
see, till now, and though I have nothing
worth while to say but to tell you of my
welfare, which I know you are still glad
to hear. I have been very well since
you left me, though I have taken no med-
icine of any kind. You will be ready
to say, What have you been doing all
this time? I have been very throng in
my own way. I have spun a little web
of droget and done many odd things.
	We have got another fine little boy
here last Monday morning. Isabella is
doing well.
	They have had a long and sore fight
with the harvest. It is nearly finished.
It is a good crop, and upon the whole no
great damage is done. We had a bit-
ter snow and frost last week; it is gone
again, however, but the weather is still
coarse, with good days among. I had
a long letter from London about the
time I got yours with the socks, which
are very comfortable indeed. I have
them on at this moment, and my feet are
as warm as pie. Many thanks to the
giver. The iron is likewise an excel-
lent one, a perfect conceit. Many, many
thanks.
	I was sorry to hear of your lassie turn-
ing out so badly. She had too much
confidence. One should trust them no
farther than they see. Old James of
the hill is just come up for some beasts
of Alicks. He talks of taking them
over the water to sell them soon. So you
will perhaps have a visit of him soon.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00304" SEQ="0304" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="298">	298	Unpublished Letters of Carigle.

	You must not be long in writing to
me, my good bairn, and tell me how
you are coming on. Are you anything
healthy now? I intend visiting you, if
I be well. Afterward it will be the next
year before I think of coming. They
were all well at London when I got their
letter. John was at Geneva. I long to
hear from him, and to know where he
is now. I am expecting word daily.
The rest are all well, for aught I know;
but Jainie is at Annan to-day, and he
will hear of them all, as Alick was at
Dumfries yesterday.
	Your folk are all well. I saw Wil-
liam Hanning last week at the market
with John. He told me he had sent
away a letter that day, I think, to you.
I forgot to tell you how Toni is getting
on with his book. He intends going to
press about New Years Day. It will
be a fine time for him. May we all go
on in the strength of God, the Lord,
making mention of His righteousness,
even of His only, trusting in Him for all
we need for time and for eternity. I
had done, but have just got a letter from
the good Doctor, wrote about a fortnight
since. If he is well, lie is near Rome by
this time.
	Write, for I can write none. Send
me a long letter. No more.
From your own mother,
M.	A. CAIrLYLE.

	They are all well at Annan and Dam-
fries.
	Friday. I believe Alick goes off for
Liverpool to-day. Send me word when
to come over, and write soon.

	By the end of October, 1836, Carlyle
was already wondering what he should
do after finishing The French Revolu-
tion, and wrote to his brother John:
Here, with only literature for shelter,
there is, I think, no continuance. Bet-
ter to take a stick in your hand, and
roam the earth Teufelsdrsckhish; you
will get at least a stomach to eat bread,
 even that denied me here. On the
evening of the 12th of January, 18~?7,
the book was finished which raised Car-
lyle from obscurity  so far as the pub-
lic was concerned  to an undisputed
place among great writers. Though
popularity did not come for many a
year, fame attended him from this point
onward. The French Revolution was
not published, however, until June; and
in the interim Carlyles circumstances
looked little more promising than be-
fore. A week after he had finished the
last sentence, and handed the manuscript
to his wife with a since famous and
often-quoted speech, he found time and
spirits to send prescriptions of cheer-
fulness to Mrs. Hanning. The two
strokes of a pen on a newspaper sig-
nified to the Carlyle who received the
paper that all was well with the Carlyle
who sent it.

V.	CARLYLE TO MRS. HAENING, MANcHESTER.

5 CHEYNE Row, CHELSEA, LoNnoir,

19th Jany, 1837.

	REAR JENNY,  It is a long time
since I heard directly of you at any
length, or since you heard of me. To-
day, tho I have not the best disposition
or leisure, I will send you a line: there
are no franks going, but the post is
always going, and you will think a shil-
ling might be worse spent.
	We are very sorry, and not without
our anxieties, at the short notice Robert
sent us on the Newspaper; however,
the next week brought confirmation on
the favourable side, and I persuade my-
self to hope that all is getting round
again to the right state. Your health is
evidently not strong; but you are grow-
ing in years, arid have naturally a sound
constitution; you must learn to take
care and precautions, especially in the
life you are now entered upon, in that
huge den of reek and Cotton-fuz, when
one cannot go on ns in the free atmo-
sphere of the Country. Exercise, espe-
cially exercise out of doors when it is
convenient, is the best of all applianees.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00305" SEQ="0305" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="299">	Unpublished Letters of Carlyle.	2~Y9

Do not sit motionless within doors, if
there is a sun shining without, and you
are able to stir. Particularly endea-
vour to keep a good heart, and avoid all
moping and musing, whatever takes away
your cheerfulness. Sunshine in the in-
side of one is even more important than
sunshine without.
	I do not understand your way of life
so well as to know whether the Good-
man is generally at your hand; in that
case, you have both a duty to do, and
society in the doing of it independently
of others; but, at all events, frank coin-
munication with ones fellow-creatures is
a pleasure and a medicine which no life
should be without. Be not solitary, be
not idle! That is a precept of old
standing. Doing ones duties (and all
creatures have their solemn duties to do),
living soberly, meekly, walking humbly
before God, one has cause to hope that
it will be well with him, that he shall
see good in the world. Write me a let-
ter, full of all your concerns and con-
siderations, when you can muster dispo-
sition. I shall always be right glad of
such a message. In fine, I hope the
spring weather will come and set us all
up a little.
	Before going farther, let me mention
here that a Newspaper came to me last
Monday, charged nineteen shillings and
some pence! I, of course, refused it. I
got a sight of it, but could not ascertain
accurately from whom it was. Either
Alick or your Robert, I thought, but the
Post people had stamped it, and sealed
it, and smeared it all over, and marked
it Written on, so that I could make
little of it. The cover, I noticed, was
in writing paper scored with blue lines:
it strikes me it may have been the Man-
chester paper, after all, and no writing
in it but the copper - plate on a piece
of one of Roberts account papers. At
all events, when any more Newspapers
come, the law is that the cover be of
vacant blank paper; likewise we will
cease writing or marking except two
strokes on the cover, lest we get into
trouble by it. I refused this nineteen
shillings fellow; and they will be able
to make no more of it, but it will make
them more watchful in future. I mean
to write into Annandale to the like
effect.
	The Doctor sends me word out of
Rome that he wants a Dumfries Herald
forwarded to him thither. I have not
yet arranged that; but I am thinking of
having this Herald (if the days answer)
sent by Manchester, thro your hands.
I think it would reach you on Satur-
day. You could look at it, and send it
on, the same day, whereby no time at all
would be lost. The two strokes would
always be a satisfaction. We shall see
how it answers. If any such Herald,
then, come your way, you know what to
do with it.
	It is several weeks since I had any
direct tidings out of Scotland, except
what James Aitkens address of the
Courier gives me: it had the sign of
well-being on it last week. I am to
write thither shortly, having a letter of
the Doctors lying here, as I have hint-
ed. The Doctor says he had written a
few days before to our Mother, which
has made me less anxious about speed
with this to her. He is well and doing
tolerably well,  getting what Practice
in Rome a beginner can expect. The
Cholera was about gone from Naples,
and the panic of it from Rome, so that
more English were coming in, and he
hoped to do still better. You can send
this news into the Scotch side when you
have opportunity.
	All people here have got a thing they
call Influenza, a dirty, feverish kind of
cold; very miserable, and so general as
was hardly ever seen. Printing-offices,
Manufactories, Tailor-shops, and such
like are struck silent, every second man
lying sniftering in his respective place
of abode. The same seems to be the
rule in the North, too. I suppose the mis-
erable temperate of climate may be the</PB>

cause. Worse weather never fell from
the Lift, to my judgment, than we have
here. Reek, mist, cold, wet; the day
before yesterday there was one of our
completest London fogs,  a thing of
which I suppose you even at Manches-
ter can form no kind of notion. For
we are exactly ten times as big as you
are, and parts of us are hardly less
reeky and dirty; farther, we lie flat, on
the edge of a broad river: and now sup-
pose there were a mist, black enough,
and such that no smoke or emanation
could rise from us, but fell agaiu the
instant it had got out of the chimney-
head! People have to light candles at
noon, coaches have torch-bearers run-
ning at the horses heads. It is like a
sea of ink. I wonder the people do not
all drop down dead in it,  since they
are not fishes, of a particular sort. It
is cause enough for Influenza. Poor
Jane, who misses nothing, has caught
fast hold of this Sunday last, and has
really been miserably ill. She gets bet-
ter these last two days, but is weak as
water; indeed, the headache at one time
was quite wretched. She has been, on
the whole, stronger since you saw her,
but is not at all strong. As for myself,
I have felt these wretched fogs pene-
trating into me, with a clear design to
produce cough; but I have set my face
against it and said No. This really
does a great deal, and has served me
hitherto. I hope to escape the Influ-
enza; they say it is abating.
	The Book is done, about a week ago:
this is my best news. I have got the
first printed sheet, since I sat down to
write this. We shall go on swiftly, it
is to be hoped, and have it finished and
forth into the world, say, before the
month of March end. I care little what
becomes of it then; it has been a sore
Book to me. There are two things I
was printing lately, which I would send
to you, but there is no conveyance. I
fear you would do little good with them,
at any rate; not five shillings worth of
good, which they would cost you. Be-
sides, if Robert or you want to see them,
you can let him go to a Circulating Li-
brary and ask for the last Number of
the London and Westminster Review.
In it he will find a thing called Memoirs
of Mirabeau: that thing is mine. The
other thing is in Frasers Magazine, 
half of it; the other half will be in the
February Number: it is called Diamond
Necklace.
	This latter was written at Craigenput-
tock a good while ago. I see your Man-
chester Editor feels himself aggrieved
by it, worthy man, but hints that there
may be some mistake on his part; which
I do very seriously assure him is my
opinion, too. Other Editors, it would
seem, sing to the same tune.
	After this Book is printed, it remains
uncertain what I shall do next. One
thing I am firmly enough resolved on:
not to spend the summer here. I will
have myself rested, and see the fields
green and the sky blue yet one year,
follow what may. Many things call me
towards Scotland; but nothing can yet
be determined upon. If I go North-
ward, Manchester is a likely enough
step for me; nay, perhaps the Doctor
may be home from Rome, and we shall
both be there! Nothing is yet fixed;
we will hope all this.
	And now, my dear Sister, I must bid
thee good day. Salute Robert from me
with all manner of good wishes. I have
known him as a fell fellow since he
was hardly longer than my leg. Tell
him to be diligent in business, and also
(for that is another indispensable thing)
fervent in spirit, struggling to serve God.
Make thou a good wife to him, helping
him in all right things by counsel and
act. Good be with you both! Jane
sends you all good wishes from her sick
bed, and was grieved to hear of what
had happened you. She will be better
in a day or two.
Your affectionate Brother,
T.	CARLYLE.</PB>

	The next letter, a holy and a cheer-
ful note from Margaret Carlyle to her
daughter, falls of necessity between 1836
and 1840, the year of Mrs. Hannings
going to Manchester and that of her
leaving it. The statement that Tom
	has to begin to lecture the first of
May, and has no time to prepare, points
to 1837; for all the following courses
Carlyle had time to make ready. This
first series, with German Literature for
subject, was suddenly arranged by a num-
ber of Carlyles friends,  Miss Marti-
neau zealous among them,  in the fear
that, unless things brightened for him, he
would be forced to leave London, and
perhaps England. The lectures were a
great success; Carlyle spoke, instead of
reading, to an audience of Marchion-
esses, Ambassadors, ah me! and what
not; and the resulting sum of one hun-
dred and thirty - five pounds, with the
promise of another course for the next
season, settled the household gods more
firmly on their pedestals. In the words
of Mrs. Carlyle, Nothing that he has
ever tried seems to me to have carried
such conviction to the public heart that
he is a real man of genius, and worth
being kept alive at a moderate rate.

VI.	ro MRS. HANNING, MANCHESTER, rRoM
HER MOTHER.

SoorsuRiG, April 9th [183711.

	DEAR JENNY, I have nothing worth
writing at this time. We are all in our
usual health. I have had little Grace
with me these three weeks. Now I have
to go to Dumfries this week to put some
money in the bank for John, your bro-
ther. It is at Dumfries by this time. I
told Mary to bid you write me soon and
tell me how you are coming on. If you
have not written, write to Dumfries.
Do you know that Jane has been very
badly? She is rather better. Thank
God, her mother is there with them.
She took a coach and went straight for
London. Tom is in a great hubble at
this time: you will know he has to be-
gin to lecture the first of May, and has
no time to prepare. May God be with
him and all of us, and as our day is so
may our strength be, and may He pre-
pare us for whatever He see meet to
come in our way, that it may be for His
glory and our good in the end. Our
time is short at longest: may we have
grace given us to improve it.
	I had no thought of writing at this
time, but Fanny Caruthers called and
told me she was going to Manchester.
She is much altered: I did not know
her. Now, Jenny, I intend to see you
this summer; I cannot say when, but if
health permit I will come. If I am long
in coming, I can stay the longer: it de-
pends on Tom when he comes home. It
will be June at the soonest before he
can get away. I had a letter from him
shortly which troubled me not a little,
telling of Janes illness. She is rather
better, but still confined to her bed at
last accounts, which was about a week
ago. I had a letter of John: he was
well then. Write soon and tell me how
you keep your health, now this cold
weather is come, and how is Robert.
Thank him in my name for nursing you
s~ well when you were poorly. I hope
you are stout now. Take good care of
yourself and be well when I come over.
I long to see you both. I will add no
more, but am still
	Your loving mother,
MARGARET A. CARLYLE.

	God be with us all, and bless us, and
do us good.
	Clap your thumbs on mistakes.

	On the 7th of June Carlyle wrote
to Sterling, I cannot say a word to
you of the book or of the lectures, ex-
cept that by the unspeakable blessing of
Heaven they are finished. A few
days after the date of this letter, says
Froude, Carlyle fled to Scotland, fairly
broken down. That he lingered a fort-
night longer in Chelsea, however, the fol-
lowing letter is witness.</PB>

VII.	CARLYLE TO MES. HANNING, MANCHESTER.

5 CHEYNE Row, CHELSEA, LONDON,

20th June, 1837.

	M~ DEAR JENNY,  I write to-day
with one of the worst of pens and in the
extreme hurry of packing, to say that I
am just coming off for Annandale, and
shall take Lancashire in my way. I
think of taking the steamboat to-morrow
morning for Hull. After that, I believe
we go by Leeds and then to Manchester,
where I hope to find you and your Good-
man well. The times and the distances
after getting to Hull, as we hope on
Thursday, are unknown to me. Most
probably, I should think, it will be on
Saturday that I get to you, but it may
be the day after, it may be the day be-
fore, for all is yet uncertain; nay, there
is a certain Dr. Hunter in Leeds, a cousin
of Janes, with whom I may (thougb that
is not very likely) loiter an hour or two.
We shall see. We shall hope to meet
all in order some how or other at last.
	Jane is to stay here till I come back,
her mother keeping her company. Jane,
as you perhaps know, has been very ill.
She has now grown much stronger again,
but still not strong enough. Her mother
hastily joined us when things were at
the worst in the month of April, and will
not quit us till we get together again.
	I am not very eminently well at pre-
sent, yet neither is anything special gone
wrong with me. I want rest, and mean
to have that now at Scotsbrig. I have
got my book completely done. I gave
a course of lectures too, &#38; c., &#38; c., and
have got all by for the present. I
seem to myself to require a little while
of repose as the one thing needful.
	A newspaper came the other day from
the Doctor, indicating that he was well.
He is not in Rome through the Summer,
but in a place called Albano, not far from
Rome. He seemed to consider it as not
unlikely that he might be here in Sep-
tember again. He bad succeeded pretty
well at Rome as a Practitioner.
	Last time I heard from Annandale our
Mother and all the rest were well. It is
not very long since,  some three weeks
or little more. They also reported well
of you at Manchester.
	Give my compliments to Robert. Say
I mean to ask his assistance in buying a
quantity of breeches, as I pass through
that huge Weaving-shop of the World. I
ought to get them there better than else-
where.
	Let us hope, therefore, that on Satur-
day, or some time near before or near
after that day, I shall succeed in finding
you at Bank Street and finding all right.
	I have not a moments time more.
Indeed, what more is there to be said at
present with such a pen?
I remain	always, my dear sister,
Your affectionate
T.	CARLVLE.


	James Carlyle was now with his mo-
ther, farming Scotsbrig for her. Alick~
did afterward go to America, and died
there. John of Cockermouth was
a half - brother. James Austin and
Mary are Carlyles brother-in-law and
sister.

VIII.	CARLYLE TO MRS. HANNING, MANCHES-
TER.
SCOTSBRIG, 18th July, 1837.

	M~ DEAR JENNY,  According to pro-
mise, I set about writing you a word
of Scotch news, now that I am fairly
settled here and know how things are.
The railway train whirled me away from
you rapidly that evening. INext evening,
about the same hour, we were getting
out of Liverpool harbour, and on the fol-
lowing morning, between seven and eight
oclock, I had got my eye upon Ahick
waving to me from the end of the Jetty
at Annan. It is almost three weeks now
that I have been here and found all well,
but it was only the day before yesterday
that we got our first visit to Dumfries
made out, and could rightly report about
matters there. I fancied a newspaper
with two strokes would communicate the</PB>

substance of what was to be said in the
interim.
	There has been a good deal of dis-
cussion about Alick and his going to
America. He himself seemed of mind
to go, but not very strongly or hopefully
set on it. Our Mother, again, was reso-
lute against it, and made such a lament-
ing as was sufficient to dishearten one
more inclined than he. So now I think
it seems fixed so far as that he will not
go. What he is to do here one does not
so well see, but it will evidently be a
great point gained for him that he give
up thinking about departure, and direct
his whole industry to ascertaining how
he can manage here where he is. Men
of far less wit than he do contrive to
manage, when once they have set their
heart on it. Jamie is quite ready to go
to Puttock and give up Scotsbrig to him,
but I still rather think there will nothing
come of that; nay, some think Alick him-
self does not at bottom wish that, but is
satisfied with finding Jamie so far ready
to accommodate him and keep him at
home. He seems very tranquil, cheer-
fuller than he was and altogether steady;
likelier to have a little fair luck than he
was a while ago. He must persist where
he is. There is nothing that can pro-
sper without perseverance. Perseverance
will make many a thing turn out well
that looked ill enough once. John of
Cockermouth is gone off to America
about a fortnight ago with all his family.
I got him a letter from Burnswark to a
brother of his at New York. I doubt
not he will do well. Clow of Land has
his property advertised for sale; means
to be off about the end of August, which
also I reckon prudent. With two or
three thousand pounds in his pocket and
four or five strong sons at his back, a
man may make a figure in America.
James Austin and Mary were at one
time talking of America, but they also
have given it up.
	We had a letter from the Doctor
shortly after my arrival here. He is
well, living at Albano, a summer resi-
dence some twenty miles from Rome.
He speaks of it being possible, or prob-
able, that he may get back to England
in September, but it is not certain. He
will be pretty sure to come by Manches-
ter and you if he come Northward. The
rest, as I have already hinted, are all
well and following their usual course.
Jamie and his wife and two sons go along
very briskly. His crops look well. He
had his Peat-stack up (and mothers little
one beside it) and his hay mown, though
the late rains and thunder have retarded
that a little. The country never looked
beantifuller in my remembrance, green
and leafy; the air is fresh, and all things
smiling and rejoicing and growing. Aus-
tin is busy enough now with work. He
had a bad time of it in spring, when
horse provender was so dear. The chib
dren are well,  even the eldest looks
better than I expected,  and Mary,
their mother, seems hearty and thrifty.
I mentioned that we had been at Dum-
fries. Alick took up our Mother and
me on Friday last in a rough Dandy-
cart of Mrs. Scotts with a beast of
Jamies. One of the first questions my
Mother asked of Jean was, Hast thou
had any word from Jenny? To which
the answer was No. Jeans child is
running about qt~ite brisk, though a lit-
tle thinner than it once was; from teeth,
I suppose. James Aitken has plenty of
work, three or four journeymen. In
short, they seem doing well. Finally,
Jamie (Maister Cairlill) authorizes me
to report that he this day met with a
brother of thy Roberts, who said that
the Peat-knowes too were all well. The
day after my arrival here I fell in with
William Hanning, the father, on Mid-
dlebie Brae, measuring some Dykes, I
think, with a son of Pottsfowns. He
looked as well as I have seen him do.
The same man as ever, though he must
be much older than he once was. The

	Our good Mother here is quite well in
health; indeed, as well every way as one
could expect, though doubtless she is a lit-
tle lonelier now than when you were with
her. She complains of nothing, but does
her endeavour to make the best of all
things. She wishes you to write very
soon and tell her how the world is serv-
ing you. She would have sent a word
or two to that effect in her own hand,
she says, but having a good clerk
(me, namely) she does not need. I
am to confirm her promise of coming
with me when I return southward, and
staying till you tire of her. There was
word from Jane on Sunday gone a week.
She wrote in haste, but at great length,
and seemed very cheerful. She will not
come hither this time, I think. Her
mother is to return home about the end
of this month. Jane appears quite pre-
pared to stay by herself. She has some
friends yonder whom she is much with,
and she rather likes the treat. Mrs.
Welsh expects Liverpool people with her
to Templand, and can stay no longer.
	I have ended my paper, dear Jenny,
and given one of the meagrest outlines
of our news. You will see, however, that
nothing is going wrong with us; that we
are thinking of you and desirous to hear
from you. Be a good bairn and a good
wife, and help your Goodman faithfully
in all honest things. He is a thrifty fel-
low with a good whole heart. There is
no danger of him. Help one another.
Be good to one another. Gods bless-
ing with you both. All here salute you.
	I am always
Your affectionate brother,
T.	CARLYLE.


	Meantime, while Jamie was building
his peat-stack in the beautifullest wea-
ther that Carlyle had ever seen, Alick
w~s setting up a shop in the village of
Ecciefechan, and The French Revolu-
tion was beginning to take the English-
reading world for its parish. The
French verdict was for the most part
adverse. M~rim6e, whether or not he
agreed with the translators in describing
Carlyle as le phenom~ne dun protestant
po6tique, expressed a sincere desire to
throw the writer out of the window.
But Dickens carried the book about with
him, Southey read it six times running,
and Mill, approving his opposite, main-
tained that the much berated style was
of high excellence. Carlyle, wishing to
lie vacant, neither read nor so much
as saw many of the reviews, though he
heard of most of them. One untactful
friend sent him the opinion of a certain
critical journal, with which he forthwith
boiled his teakettle. Much more
than a pot-boiler was one enthusiastic
review, although that function of his ar-
ticle was sadly important to the writer,
for whom Vanity Fair and fame were
still ten years ahead. Writes Carlyle to
his brother: I understand there have
been many reviews of a very mixed char-
acter. I got one in the Times last week.
The writer is one Thackeray, a half-mon-
strous Cornish giant, kind of painter,
Cambridge man, and Paris newspaper
correspondent, who is now writing for
his life in London. I have seen him at
the Bullers and at Sterlings. His ar-
ticle is rather like him, and I suppose
calculated to do the book good.

	Without regard to reviewers, and in
spite of the cholera, the homely idyl
goes melodiously on. Jean and her
two Jamies are Carlyles sister, Mrs.
Aitken, her husband and little son.
Jamie of Scotsbrig  is, of course, Car-
lyles brother. Betty Smails short his-
tory may be found in Froudes First

Ix.	cARLYLE TO MRS. MANNING, MANcHEsTER.

ScorsrnuG, EccEEFEcHAN,
28 Aug. 1837.

	DEAR JENNY,  Your letter to Mary
at Annan got this length on Saturday
night. As you appear to be impatient</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00311" SEQ="0311" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="305">	Unpublished Letters of Carlyle.	305

for news from this quarter, not unrea-
sonably, having had none for six weeks,
I am appointed to write you a few lines
without any loss of time whatever,  a
thing I can easily enough do, being even
idler to-day than common.
	We were not so well pleased to hear
of your fecklessness and pain in the
stomach during the last fortnight, but we
hope it is but something derived from
the season and will not continue. There
is very often a kind of British Chol-
era in this harvest time. It is even
very frequent at present in this region,
owing partly to the air (as they say), and
chiefly, perhaps, to the new potatoes and
other imperfectly ripened substances
which people eat. Jamie, here, had a
cast of it for two days just a week ago,
rather sharp, but he is free now. Our
Mother too was taken with it,  came
home rather ill from Ecclefechan one
day,  but by aid of Castor and some
prime Brandy has got quite round
again. You do not say that the disor-
der has got that length with you, but
very probably it is something related to
the same business. The only remedy is
to be careful of what one eats, to take
due moderate exercise in the open air,
in case of extremity employing a little
medicine. Cold, especially cold feet are
very bad; but the great thing is to take
care of ones self, especially to take care
what one eats. New potatoes are very
unwholesome for some people.
	We are now all well here, and with
the slight exception mentioned above
have been so ever since I wrote last.
Alick brought us news of you. Alicks
news are the main ones I have now to
send you. He quitted Annan on Mon-
day last (this day gone a week), and has
been in the Big house at Ecclefechan
ever since. I suppose he explained to
you and Robert the plan he had of set-
ting up a shop there. He has gathered
himself together, and is all alive after
that same enterprise now. We had him
and little Tom over here all yesterday.
	VOL. LXXXII.  NO. 491.	20
Mother, Jamie, and I walked with them
to Cleughbrae in the evening. To-day,
as we understand, he has got masons and
actually broken in upon the house to re-
pair it and arrange it for that object;
Hale Moffet and his retinue having been
got out. It is in a sad state of wreck,
the poor house, but Alick expects to put
a new face on it with great despatch in-
deed; and then, shop drawers and
all the rest being provided, and James
Aitkens brush having given the last
touch to it, he will unfold his wares and
try the thing in the name of Hope. We
all pray heartily that it may prosper be-
yond his expectations. Ecclefechan is a
sad Village: only last Friday night some
blackguard broke 14 panes of the Meet-
ing House windows. Fancy such an act
of dastardly atrocity as that! But it
lies in the centre of a tolerable country,
too, and certain there is need of some
good shop and honest Trader there.
	I have seen Mary pretty frequently,
the last time on Friday last. She is
very well, and all her bairns are well.
James has always some work, though
seldom enough, and Mary is the bright-
est, thriftiest little creature that can be.
They go on there as well as one could
hope in these times. We had a letter
from the Doctor, too: still in the same
place,  Albano, near Rome; still well;
uncertain as to his future movements or
engagements, though it must be settled
some way before this date, if we knew
how. He seemed to think it very unlike-
ly that he would be here in the present
autumn, the likeliest of all that he would
try to return next spring. The Cholera
was in that country, but had not got to
them. We fancy they will not fail to fly
out of the road of it, if it advance too
near.
	I was at Dumfries since I wrote: up
to Templand, and then again at Dum-
fries on my return. Mrs. Welsh came
home several weeks ago, and had at the
time I was up, and has still, her Liverpool
friends with her. The house was very</PB>

crowded. I was not very well, and stayed
only four and twenty hours or so, cut-
ting out my way in spite of all entrea-
ties. Jean and her two Jamies are very
tolerably well: the elder Jamie a thrifty,
effectual, busy man; the younger as yet
altogether silent, staggering and tripping
about,  one of the gleggest little elves
I have seen. There is talk of her com-
ing down to Annan this very week to
have the benefit of the tide for sea bath-
ing. Jamie of Scotsbrig, who goes up
tomorrow to pay his rent, will bring us
word.
	The other morning, walking out, I
met Roberts father at the Lenglands
Nett, coming down from Dairlaw Hills
with a row of bog-hay carts he had been
buying at Dairlaw Hills. He was hale
and well to look at, and reported all
well. I suppose he has been very busy
of late; seldom were so many roups
seen in one season; all the farmers sell-
ing off, none of them having money for
their rent day ; Land farm, and now all
the stock, crop, and household furniture
have been sold off. Poor Clow goes off
for America on Wednesday morning by
the Liverpool steamer. People are all
sorry. The Burnfoot Irvings, or Sandy
Cowie for them, have bought his land:
4000.
	Betty Small, bound for Ecelefechan,
has been waiting this half hour till I
should be done; I did not know of her
when I began. The needfullest thing,
therefore, that I can do is to tell you
about our coming. It will be soon, but
is still uncertain when. I should say in
about a fortnight,  nay, in a day or so
less; but it depends somewhat on a letter
we look for from Jane which has not yet
come to hand. Jane, you must know,
after her mothers departure went into
the country with the Sterlings, friends
of hers. I wish her to stay there while
she likes, and would get home about the
same time as she; a month was the
time she first spoke of, and that I have
little doubt will suffice,  so my guess
is as above given. A newspaper with
one stroke on it will come to you (bar-
ring mistakes) two days before you are
to look for us. This shall be a token,
and we need not write any more. Alick
has some talk of coming with us to get
his goods ready then, but I think he
will hardly be ready. The butter and
another firkin of butter has been talked
of and will be forthcoming, but it seems
dubious whether any of it will get with
us. It can come before or after, I be-
lieve safe and with little expense. Mo-
ther will bring some pounds of it in
her box. I shall perhaps be obliged to
go back by Liverpool, and must not cal-
culate to stay more with you than a day.
My Mother sends you both her love (she
is smoking here); she will tell you all
her news when we come. Compliments
and good wishes to Robert from all of
us. We are glad to hear his trade is
better. A glegg fellow like him will get
through worse troubles than this. God
keep you, my dear little Jenny.
Your affectionate Brother,
T.	CARLYLE.


X.	TO MRS. HANNING, MANcHEsTER, FROM HER
MOTHER.

[ScoTsBRIG] January 11th [1838].

	DEAR CHILDREN,  I received your
letter this day about mid-day. Then
Alick and his family came here, so we
talked on till bedtime; and now they are
gone to bed. I am sorry to hear that
Jenny is poorly. I intend to see you
very soon; I cannot say pointedly which
day yet. I am going down to Annan
with Alick, and will fix. It shall not he
long, God willing. I have some thoughts
of taking the steamer. Keep up your
heart, Jenny, and be well when I come.
Trust in God, casting all your cares on
Him. He is a kind father to all them
that put their trust in Him. I will say
no more to-night; it is late. Do you
think the railway is passable?
	I had not finished this scrawl when I
received your last letter, of which I was</PB>

very glad. It is all well, Gods will be
done. I was coming by the steamer on
Thursday or Friday. Now I will let
the storm blow by. Now, Jenny, be very
careful of yourself; take care of cold,
and likewise what you eat. May Gods
blessing rest on us all. May He make
us thankful for all His ways of dealing
with us. Write soon. You may direct
to Annan, as I will be there some time.
Could you let Tom know that Jam there,
also, and that I am well? Now, bairns,
write soon. You see I cannot write,
though nobody would take greater plea-
sure in it.
Your own mother,
MARGARET A. C.

P.	S. My tooth is better, though not
very sound yet. I forgot to thank you
very kindly for the things you sent me.

	In the two ensuing years Carlyle gave
two more courses of lectures, both nota-
bly successful. Among many other new
acquaintances was Mr. Baring, after-
ward Lord Asliburton, who, with his two
wives, was to figure so largely in the
lives of Carlyle and his wife. Sartor
Resartus was published in England, and
republished in the United States. Chart-
ism was written and printed. Other
events of the same biennium were Mrs.
Carlyles only Soir~e, tbe appearance
of Count dOrsay in Cheyne Row, and

FIFTY YEARS OF AMERICAN SCIENCE.

	ON April 2, 1840, eighteen American
savants met in Philadelphia and organ-
ized themselves into The American
Society of Geologists. Within two years
the association extended its field of ac-
tivity, and added and Naturalists to
its title. Still later other sciences were
given hearing, and at a notable meet-
ing held in Boston in 1847 it was de-
cided to remodel the organization on
the lines of a British association that
had been a power in shaping intellectual
progress for a quarter-century. In ac-
cordance with this action, the leading
scientific men of the country met in Phil-
adelphia, September 20, 1848, and insti-
tuted The American Association for
the Advancement of Science. Such was
the origin of the leading American sci-
entific society, a distinctively American
body, meant to increase and to diffuse
exact knowledge among the people; and
its semi-centenary anniversary, celebrat-
ed by the meeting in Boston, is a Jubilee
of American Science.
	Scientific progress, especially in a land
of free institutions, is so closely inter-
woven with industrial and social progress
that the advance of one cannot be traced
without constant reference to the other.
Indeed, the statement of our national
progress during the past half-century is
little more than a summary of results and
practical applications of scientific re-
search. Fifty years ago our population
was hardly more than twenty millions,
now it is seventy millions; then our
wealth was less than seven billion dol-
lars, now it is eighty billions. At the
beginning of the year 1848 there were
fifty-two hundred and five miles of rail-
way in the United States, now there
are two hundred thousand,  far more
than any other country has, more than
all Europe; nearly as many miles, in-
deed, as all the rest of the world put
together. Some of those who attended
the first meeting of the Association made
their journey, or part of it, by stage-
coach or in the saddle. They met many</PB></P>

a boy riding to the neighborhood mill
with a bag of corn as grist and saddle,
and the itinerant doctor or minister on
horseback, with his wife on a pillion be-
hind; they passed by farmers swinging
the back-breaking cradle or wielding the
tedious hoe, while lusty horses grew fat
in idleness; they caught glimpses of
housewives spinning and dyeing and
weaving with infinite pains the fabrics
required to clothe their families; they
followed trails so rough that the trans-
portation of produce to market multiplied
its cost, and carrying back family sup-
plies was a burden: everywhere they
saw hard human toil, enlivened only by
the cheer of political freedom, and they
did not even dream of devices whereby
nature should be made to furnish the
means for her own subjugation. Most of
the mails were carried slowly by coaches
and postboys; the telegraph was little
more than a toy; the telephone, the
trolley-car, and the typewriter had not
begun to shorten time and lengthen life;
and steel was regularly imported from
Sheffield, and iron from Norway. The
slow and uncertain commerce of interior
navigation was the pride of publicists,
and Chicago boasted a population of
twenty - five thousand; a shallow wave
of settlement was flowing over the vast
interior to break against the bluffs of
the Missouri, though the pioneers still
feared to pitch tents on the broad prairie-
lands, and chose rather the rugged and
rocky woodlands skirting the waterways
as sites for homesteads; the fertile sub-
humid plains, with ten million buffalo
feeding on their nutritious grasses, were
still mapped as the great American
desert;  the Rocky Mountain region be-
yond was a mystical land, yielding the
wildest and weirdest of travelers tales;
California was an Ultima Thule more
remote in thought and interest than are
Hawaii or even the Philippines to-day.
	Then, as now, the nation was in the
throes of growing-pains, acuter than now,
because territorial expansion was more
rapid: Texas had recently given its em-
pire,  an empire of barren breadths
and bloody bandits, according to the
critics,  and Florida had lately come to
us from Spain; Iowa and Wisconsin
had entered the family of states, and
Oregon had hecome a troublesome ter-
ritory; and the treaty of Guadalupe-
Hidalgo had just been approved, bring-
ing California and New Mexico (with
most of what is now Arizona) into our
possession,  adding the care of hope-
less deserts and the control of trea-
cherous tribes and an alien population
to the duties of an overworked legisla-
tive and administrative government, and
preparing the way for the witticism,
Mexico will be forgiven all if she will
only take back her lands. In truth,
there was danger, painfully manifest
thirteen years later, of disruption through
overgrowth of the local interests and
provincialisms always straining our theo-
retic union,  a danger happily removed
forever a quarter-century later by the
railway and the telegraph, which gave
a stronger unity than political faith or
governmental doctrine.
	The progress of the nation during the
half-century is beyond parallel. By nor-
mal growth and peaceful absorption with-
out foreign conquest the population has
trebled, and the national wealth has in-
creased tenfold. The subjugation of nat-
ural forces has proceeded at a higher
rate, and the extension of knowledge
and the diffusion of intelligence have
gone forward more rapidly still. This
advance, so great as to be grasped by
few minds, is the marvel of human his-
tory. The world has moved forward as
it never did before. Yet fully half of
the progress of the world, during the last
fifty years, has been wrought through
the unprecedented energy of American
enterprise and genius, guided by Ameri-
can science.
	It is to a great degree through special
research that knowledge advances; yet
it is by no means to be forgotten that the</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00315" SEQ="0315" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="309">	Fifty Years of American Science.	309
specialty is but a column in the Lane of
science, and that arcades and keystones
and swelling dome hold higher places.
Worthy has been the work of specialists
in the extension of knowledge, during
the half-century; but nobler still have
been the tasks of the fewer searchers
who have been able to span two or more
specialties, and to simplify knowledge by
co6rdination. The solidarity of science is
well illustrated by the work of the phy-
sicist Bunsen and the chemist Kirchoff,
both of Germany, who in 1859 combined
their specialties (as few great men are
able to do) and blent ideas in the inven-
tion of the spectroscope, which has revo-
lutionized several sciences. By aid of
this device, later chemists and physicists
have discovered new facts and made
some of the most important generaliza-
tions of the time; by its daily aid, the
metallurgist applies the Bessemer pro-
cess, which has revolutionized the steel
production of the world; aided by a de-
rivative device (the bolometer), Langley
has been able to measure and weigh the
light and combustion rate of the firefly
lamp, and thus to gain a new point of
view in physiology. Still greater has
been the service of the spectroscope to
the astronomer; for it has brought, as it
were, to the test-tube and crucible, our sun
and other suns, and the luminous planets
and comets, so that their substance may
be analyzed hardly less definitely than the
rocks beneath our feet; it even enables
the astronomer to read from the shifting
lines of the spectrum the relative mo-
tions of stars long thought to be fixed.
This application of the spectroscope
marks the most noteworthy advance in
astronomy not only of the half-century
that is now closing, but of all time. No
key ever unlocked sublimer revelations
or more inspiring vistas than this instru-
ment which opened the door of the New
Astronomy.
	A few of the principal advances in
science, made in the last fifty years, may
be noted.
	Europe and America have contributed
to astronomy, during the half-century, in
fairly equal measure. The spectroscope
was the gift of the older country, and
some of its most brilliant products were
brought forth by Huggins and other
transatlantic students; yet spectroscopy
was revolutionized by the American
physicist Rowland, with his exquisitely
delicate diffraction gratings and his mar-
velous mechanism for producing them.
So, too, the photometric work of the
Pickerings in Harvard Observatory, with
its adjunct in Peru, and the star cata-
logues of the lamented Gould and his
successors in Cordova, are unexcelled,
while the best inventory of modern star
science, The New Astronomy, is the
work of the American astronomer Lang-
ley. Some part of the success of cis-
atlantic astronomers must be ascribed
to the mechanical ingenuity which seems
to spring up spontaneously with intel-
lectual freedom, and which enabled the
Alvan Clarks, father and son, to produce
the finest telescopic lenses the world has
seen, with no less excellent fittings. Yet
there has been no lack of patient wait-
ing and minute scrutiny of the stolid
mid - European type, as shown by the
half-centurys discoveries of asteroids
and planetary satellites and comets, of
which America has done the greater
part. The prophecy of American pres-
tige in astronomy came in 1860, when
Newcomb reduced the orbits of the as-
teroids to a simple system; and it is
just now fulfilled beyond all early anti-
cipation in a recomputation of the ele-
ments of the solar system by the same
indefatigable delver among definite
quantities. This work alone marks an
epoch; the sun and moon and planets
have been weighed as exactly as sugar
and tea at the grocers, and their paths
measured as precisely as silks and wool-
ens at the drapers. Most of the ships
of civilized nations set their courses by
nautical almanacs computed on the New-
combian basis; and the name of New-</PB>

comb is more widely known than the
name of any other astronomer, and has
brought tribute to America from every
civilized country. Characteristically
American is the recent work of Chan-
dler, who, first following and then out-
stripping the brilliant Euler, has recon-
ciled the discrepancies in latitude-records
of European and American observato-
ries, and discovered a new law of plan-
etary motion, expressed in periodic wan-
dering of the terrestrial poles. Equally
characteristic is the work of Young on
the sun, Newton on meteoroids, Bar-
nard on comets, and a dozen others in
as many special lines, including the sug-
gestive results of Percival Lowell in his
observatories on both American conti-
nents.
	The genius of American astronomers
has brought appreciation from laymen
as well as investigators, and their labors
have been rewarded by increased facil-
ities; America is better endowed to-
day with observatories and apparatus
than any other country,  nearly as well
as all the rest of the world. Most of
our rapidly growing universities have
their own observatories. A dozen years
ago the installation of Lick Observatory
was an event in the scientific world, and
attracted such public attention as to leave
little for the two observatories installed
within the year,  Flower Observatory
in Pennsylvania, and Yerkes Observa-
tory, an adjunct of the University of
Chicago. Fifty years ago astronomy
was a sober and sluggish science, far
removed from practical every-day inter-
ests, cultivated respectably in Europe
and beginning to attract serious atten-
tion in this country. To-day its data
are doubled and its activity is tripled;
it touches industry and the public wel-
fare at many points, and advances more
rapidly than ever before; and a full
share of this progress is due to Ameri-
can genius and industry.

	Half a century ago, Dr. Joule, of Eng
land, was engaged in a series of physical
experiments, beginning with solids and
ending with liquids, which indicated that
while force may be controlled, it can-
not be created or destroyed. Faraday,
Helmholtz, and Grove repeated and ex-
tended the experiments, and through the
combined efforts of the four masters in
physical science the law of the conser-
vation of energy was developed, and a
new era in the history of science was
opened. Half a century earlier, chem-
istry had established the indestructibil-
ity of matter, and incidentally proved
that the material world is a world of law,
and not of chance. The complementa-
ry demonstration of the indestructibility
of force completed the groundwork for
rational thought, and a phalanx of ex-
ponents and defenders of the doctrine
of the uniformity of nature, marshaled
under John Tyndall, was soon in the
~field. By timely chance they fell in
with an equally vigorous phalanx head-
ed by Huxley, who were expounding
and defending the Darwinian doctrine
of derivation, or the law of the uniform-
ity of nature applied to organic species;
and the joint forces quickly consum-
mated the most sweeping intellectual re-
volution in history. Unhappily, cede-
siasticism was aroused, and for a time
Tyndall and Huxley were denounced as
destroyers of the eternal peace of their
converts; but the balm of personal as-
sociation soon smoothed the acerbities
and aided in fixing the respective bounds
of science and faith, and serious antag-
onism to applied physics came to an
end. Meantime, the mechanician found
himself in line with the thinker, the stu-
dent turned from hereditary introspec-
tion of the supernal toward the new-found
beauties of the real world, and gradual-
ly teachers came to be esteemed for
what they knew rather than for what
they conjured; practical men became
thinkers, and thinking men became prac-
tical; industry was regenerated, and the
real glory of the Victorian era began.</PB>

At first the law of the conservation of
energy was not the counterpart of the
law of the conservation of matter recog-
nized by chemists; for the ultimate and
persistent basis of matter is the atom,
while the physicists held only that the
sum of energy persists in the universe.
Recently, Powell has revised the law in
the light of generalized human experi-
ence, and suggested that motion, like
matter, inheres and persists in the ulti-
mate particle; and thereby chemistry
and physics, and the other sciences as
well, are brought into harmony. This
rendering of the fundamental law of
physics is accepted by several savants;
it is in accord with the lines of intel-
lectual and industrial progress, and gives
brilliant promise as a means of extend-
ing conquest over nature. Physical sci-
ence has been the giver of many gen-
erous gifts, but the goodliest of all was
the gift of right thinking, which was a
by-product of the law of the conserva-
tion of energy.
	The formula of physical science came
to America as a mariners compass to a
crew of maroons. Already a nation of
inventors inspired by intellectual free-
dom, Americans were still blind leaders
of the blind; for invention is impossi-
ble without at least intuitive recognition
of the uniformity of nature, while with-
out conscious recognition of this law the
inventor drifts in a sea of uncertain-
ties, making port only by chance. The
newly formulated doctrine was seized
and assimilated with such avidity that
within a decade it was more generally
understood and adopted in this country
than in all Europe. Under its stimulus
invention throve and manufacturing grew
apace: the crude reaper was made a
self-raker, next a harvester or header,
then a self-binder or field-thresher, ac-
cording to local needs; the hoe gave
way to the horse-cultivator, and the flail
to the horse-power thresher, the neigh-
borhood water-mill to the steam-driven
roller-mill grinding for all the people of
a whole state; and the farmer learned to
live by the strength of his beasts and
the craft of his machines merely guided
by his own intelligence. The mechanic
arts were regenerated; steam was har-
nessed more effectively than before, and
our railway-making and locomotive-build-
ing became and remain a revelation to
the world; for within this year, 1898,
European engineers have been compelled
to swallow incredulity as to the rapidity
of American bridge-building, while IJ3rit-
ish promoters hastening to supply Egypt
with locomotives have saved half the
time required for delivery, despite the
doubling of distance, by ordering from
American builders. The tide of foreign
importation was soon stayed, and then
turned, and now American steel tools
are sold in Sheffield and fine American
hardware in Norway, while the products
of American machines in the form of
foodstuffs and fabrics are carried into
every quarter of the globe. The char-
acteristic of American inventiveness is
its diffusion. Invention is as free as the
franchise, and open competition gives
life to genius no less than to trade.
American devices (temporarily protect-
ed by patents) are so diffused that every
citizen is in contact with the products of
physical science and mechanical skill ;-
everybody may have a machine-made
watch better than the average hand-
made product of Geneva, nearly equal
to the tested Swiss chronometer; every
family may have its sewing-machine and
telephone; and every man, woman, and
child wears machine-made buttons, pins,
hats, and textile fabrics.
	A typical American device is the bicy-
cle. Invented in France, it long remained
a toy or a vain luxury. Redevised in this
country, it inspired inventors and capti-
vated manufacturers, and native genius
made it a practical machine for the
multitude; now its users number mil-
lions, and it is sold in every country.
Typical, too, is the bicycle in its effect
on national character. It first aroused</PB>

invention, next stimulated commerce,
and then developed individuality, judg-
ment, and prompt decision on the part
of its users more rapidly and completely
than any other device; for although as-
sociation with machines of any kind (ab-
solutely straightforward and honest as
they are all) develops character, the bicy-
cle is the easy leader of other machines
in shaping the mind of its rider, and
transforming itself and its rider into
a single thing. Better than other re-
sults is this: that the bicycle has broken
the barrier of pernicious differentiation
of the sexes and rent the bonds of fash-
ion, and is daily impressing Spartan
strength and grace, and more than Spar-
tan intelligence, on the mothers of com-
ing generations. So, weighed by its ef-
fect on body and mind as well as on
material progress, this device must be
classed as one of the worlds great in-
ventions.
	With the advance of the half-century
in simply applied mechanics, there have
been still greater advances in the know-
ledge of the more obscure powers of na-
ture, manifested in electricity and mag-
netism, in sun and wind and storm, even
in vitality and mental action. Some of
these have been made in Europe, but
more in America. Fifty years ago Morse
and Henry were doing the final work
required to transform the electric tele-
graph from a physical experiment to a
commercial agency, and soon nerves of
steel and copper, throbbing with intelli-
gence, were following the pioneer into
the remotest recesses and pushing be-
neath the ocean; Faraday, the Siemens
brothers, Helmholtz, and later Sir Wil-
liam Thomson (Lord Kelvin) freely gave
genius and toil; then came Edison with
an eruption of brilliant inventions; and
to-day time and space are as if they were
not, and from sea to sea our subjects of
thought are as one. It was but yester-
day that half our world knew not how the
other half lived; now both halves read
~the same items at breakfast.
	Themselves harvesters after the cx-
perimentalists in physics, the early te-
legraphers were planters for Graham
Bell, and the telephone came to carry
the word of man afar, and the grapho-
phone to perpetuate it forever, and thus
to complete the annihilation of space
and time as obstacles to the diffusion
and unification of intelligence. Inspired
by success in conveying thought, invent-
ors sought to convey grosser powers, and
dynamos were invented to furnish light
better and cheaper than the world had
known before; devices for warming and
even for cooking, and for lowering tem-
perature by fans and refrigerant pipes,
quickly followed; and now the lightning
is harnessed in our houses as the thun-
der is subdued in telephone and grapho-
phone. Meantime, motors and trans-
mitters were perfected, and electric
transportation came into successful com-
petition with steam locomotion, while
the power derived from waterfalls and
central plants was made divisible, so
that units of power are now sold as
freely as pounds of tea or sugar were
fifty years ago; and a way has been
found to counteract the concentration of
artisans in factories located by waterfall
or engine. The conquest of nature by
electric power, gained through control-
ling an infinitesimal part of the vibrant
atomic energy of our corner of the cos-
mos, has come rapidly, and so steadily
as almost to escape notice; yet it is a
marvel beside which the magical lamp
of Aladdin and all other figments of
Oriental fancy are as nothing.
	In 1848 a Frenchman and an Eng-
lishman made advances in the new art
of photography, developed partly by Pro-
fessor Draper, of New York, a few years
before. In 1850 a journal of photo-
graphy was established in this country,
and the art became the property of the
people. Its progress well illustrates the
growing solidarity of nations, for contri-
butions have been made by England,
France, Germany, and other countries,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00319" SEQ="0319" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="313">	Fifty Years of American Science.	313

as well as America, and parts of the
same apparatus are often the handiwork
of two or more countries. Americas
contributions to the art are characteris-
tic in that they have reduced the cost
and increased the use of the apparatus
so far that every village and a tenth of
our families have their cameras. Recent
events indicate that a new field is open-
ing for the picture-maker, and the next
half - century may see advances much
greater than those of the last; for while
photography has been limited to lumi-
nous rays and to portraiture of external
surfaces, Roentgen has proved the pos-
sibility of using other phases of radiant
energy, and of depicting internal struc-
tures as well as outer forms.
	Half a century ago Joseph Henry pub-
lished the plan of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and his first-mentioned means of
increasing knowledge was a system of
extending meteorological observations
for solving the problem of American
storms. So began a line of research
which has added much to science, and
is daily contributing to personal com-
fort and material prosperity. Of old the
wind blew where it listed, the rain fell
on the just and the unjust alike, and men
reeked no more of the hurricane than of
the earthquake, for both were ascribed to
malevolent and unavoidable fate. The
dark confession of weakness still clings
to those who go down to the sea in ships,
making them the most superstitious of
modern folk, and it crops up uncannily
in the exemption phrase of even modern
transatlantic contracts, acts of God ex-
cepted. Against this blighting faith in
the malign Franklin set himself a cen-
tury before Henry, when he led light-
ning from the skies on a kite-string, and
invented the lightning-rod; but the real
awakening began with the Smithsojiian
Institution. For twenty years the work
was little more than observation in East-
ern cities, giving data for laws, but not
the laws themselves. During the reac-
tion from the civil war several military
men turned toward nobler conquest, and
observation was extended and systema-
tized in a science so definite as to confer
the gift of prevision. Up to the present
generation the principal contributions to
meteorology came from Europe, and
such names as Buys - Ballot, Buchan,
Dove, and Delaunny were better known
in this country than those of our own in-
vestigators, while so late as 18Th the data
for Coffins Winds of the Globe were
submitted to the Russian Weikoff for
discussion before they were issued by the
Smithsonian Institution.
	Now the tide has turned. Generals
Hazen and Greely and the civilians
Harrington and Moore have built up the
largest weather bureau in the world, and
with the aid of physicists like Ferrel,
Abbe, and Mendenhall have shi~ped
weather science; while Langley has led
thinkers into new paths by his studies
of the internal work of the wind, and
their application to problems of aerial
flight. Much of the success of Ameri-
can air science must be ascribed to the
accident of geography, which gives a
broader field for the study of the atmo-
sphere than any other nation enjoys, 
more favorable, even, than the two em-
pires of Russia. Yet geographic bigness
is but one of the elements of Ameri-
can greatness, in this as in other depart-
ments of knowledge, such as engineer-
ing, geology, and anthropology. To-day
a central office cotwdinates observations
not only from the Atlantic to the Pacific
and from the Great Lakes to the Gulf,
but, through international comity, from
Canadian territory on the north to Mex-
ican territory on the south. The obser-
vations yield predictions benefiting agri-
culture and shipping to the extent of
millions annually. They yield also prin-
ciples which are enlightening the world,
mitigating faith in Moloch and strength-
ening confidence in human might, and so
preparing the way for still more brilliant
conquest by generations yet to come.
	Meteorology does not give control of</PB>

the powers of the air and the vapors
within it (pseudo-science to the contrary
notwithstanding), but only enables men
so to adjust themselves to these agents
as to gain benefit and to avoid injury;
yet conquest over the immeasurable po-
tentialities of the atmosphere is extend-
ing in other ways. Half a century ago
gases were the most elusive of substances,
seldom allied in thought to liquids save
in loose speculation, hardly brought from
the domain of mysticism into the realm
of reality. Now the continuity of the
gaseous condition with liquidity and so-
lidity has been established for the more
important terrestrial substances. A dozen
years ago Cailletet in France and Pic-
tet in Switzerland liquefied various
gases by high pressure and low tempera-
ture. Dewar, of England, followed in a
striking series of operations, liquefying
gas after gas, until within a few weeks
hydrogen  most refractory of the ele-
ments and the unit of matter  has been
brought into liquid form, and the Arner-
ican Tripler has devised means of
liquefying air in large quantities at lim-
ited cost. To-day scientists find them-
selves on the threshold of a new pro-
spect opened by these conquests. The
possibilities of future applications can-
not be presaged clearly, but there are
indications that they will equal those
made through the control of electricity.
Liquid hydrogen is only one fourteenth
the weight of water; it boils at  238~ C.
(~396o F.), or only 350 C. above abso-
lute zero, while liquid air is a little light-
er than water, and boils (or vaporizes)
at1910 C. (~312o F.). In the ab-
stract the figures carry little meaning,
but made concrete they signify that just
as the astronomer finds himself approach-
ing the limits of the material universe
through the telescope and the spectro-
scope, and just as the morphologist is
approaching actual vision of molecular
constitution through the microscope, so
the physicist finds himself nearing the
point at which the definite constitution of
matter must begin,  the real sunrise of
the material universe, beyond which lies
chaos only. Considered in their con-
crete application, the figures are still
more significant. The uses of liquid
air for wholesale cooling, as an adjunct
in chemical and metallurgical operations,
and even as a terrible instrument of war,
have already been tested or suggested;
yet the stimulus of discovery has hardly
begun to affect the mass of inventors.
	As doctrinal prejudice melted, and as
chemistry established the continuity be-
tween organic and inorganic substances,
the sum of experience and weight of
reason wrought a revolution in thought,
and the dominion of law over living mat-
ter was soon accepted implicitly, if not
explicitly. The extension of law into
the realm of intellectual processes came
later, and more tediously and haltingly.
A noteworthy step was taken in 1859,
when Joseph Le Conte illustrated cer-
tain cases of interconvertibility of physi-
cal and mental forces. His exposition
was republished and widely reviewed
and discussed in Europe, where it in-
spired experiments and the making of
special apparatus,  always the strong
side of transatlantic research; for the
European pioneer puts stepping-stones
where the American lays a bridge.
Meantime, Barker, after demonstrating
the interconvertibility of physical and
vital forces in 1875, passed into the
higher realm, and definitively extended
the correlation to mental force. Other
contributions followed; and while there
are still those who dread to lift the veil
of mystery above a certain point,  per-
chance through confounding mental pro-
cess and intellectual product,  the more
vigorous investigators recognize the phy-
sical basis of mentation, and a science
of psychology has arisen, standing to
metaphysical psychology much as astro-
logy stood to astronomy and alchemy
to chemistry. It is represented fittingly
in America. The consequences and ap-
plications of this advance of the half-</PB>

century may no more be foretold than
those of others newly made; yet even if
it mean no more thai~t the extension of
law into a new realm, and the replace-
ment of chaos by order in human thought,
it must take an important place in the
history of science.

	An important advance in chemistry
was forecast in 1811 by the Italian Avo-
gadro, and soon after by the French-
man Ainp~re, through the discovery that
equal volumes of all substances, when in
the gaseous state and under like condi-
tions, contain the same number of mole-
cules; that is, that the constitution of
matter is connected with its own inher-
ent motion. The discovery was barren
until fertilized by the law of the con-
servation of energy, and became fully
fruitful only under the skillful treatment
of the American Cooke, who used it as
the basis of the New Chemistry about
the middle of the half-century. The
advance marked the extension of natural
law into a field long cumbered by the
mystical wreckage of alchemy, and sig-
nalized the lifting of interpretation from
the plane of the material to that of the
kinetic. A new chapter in the history
of chemistry was opened by KekuM, of
Flanders, in 1858. This was the dis-
covery of valence, or the law of propor-
tion under which atoms combine to form
substances,  a far-reaching, though pos-
sibly not final law governing the consti-
tution of matter. The laws of Avogadro
and Kekul~ yielded a larger view of the
unknown; and by their aid Mendelejeff,
of Russia, and almost at the same time
(186970) Lothar-Meyer, of England,
discovered that the known elementary
substances fall naturally into groups dis-
playing certain family resemblances,
while the groups fall into series defined
by properties of the atoms; and these
facts were formulated in the remarkably
comprehensive periodic law, or law of
Mendelejeff.
	From the culminating point of view
afforded by this law the domain of
chemistry may be surveyed, as was the
domain of astronomy through aid of
Keplers law, and the endless actions
and reactions involved in the making
and decomposition of materials, in
growth and decay, are found to be no
less orderly and harmonious than the
swing of satellites and planets and suns
in our solar and stellar systems; chem-
ists can now invade the unseen urn-
verse, and determine the properties of
elements not yet discovered, as Adams
located Neptune by formulas before it
was detected by lenses. The power of
prevision possessed by chemists, under
the periodic law, has been established
over and over again by successful pre-
dictions. Indeed, at a meeting in To-
ronto, last year, the president of a chem-
ical body dared to devote his address to
description of an element still unseen,
and the developments of the year have
justified his courage.
	One of the results of these epoch-
making discoveries was increased confi-
dence on the part of the organic chem-
ists, who, beginning with Wdhler and
Berzelius, were cautiously~creating bylab-
oratory synthesis compounds previously
held to transcend simple nature. Within
the half-century the laws of the inor-
ganic world have been extended, first to
organic compounds, then to organic pro-
cesses, and finally to the essentially vital
processes exhibited by both plants and
animals; to-day the chemist and physi-
cist stand on common ground to sus-
tain and explain physiology, and even
the modern psychology which finds the
source of mentation in cerebral decom-
position and recomposition.
	During recent decades the applications
of chemistry have multiplied and extend-
ed in various directions. The new alloys
required fornovel physical and industrial
devices have been produced; high explo-
sives innumerable have been compound-
ed; and the chemist has cooperated with
the physicist in liquefying gases, and with</PB>

the astronomer in analyzing suns and
comets and the rings of Saturn. Mean-
time, chemistry has been brought into
touch with daily life as an adjunct to
medicine, and as a means of testing foods
and drugs in public sanitation. Perhaps
the most brilliant applications of chem-
istry sprang from researches concerning
the hydrocarbons preserved in the rocks
of the earth as records of vitality dur-
ing ages past; and the coal-tar products
have been made to yield dyes rivaling
the rainbow in brilliancy and range of
color, perfumes stronger than musk and
sweeter than attar of roses, flavors more
sapid than sugar and spice, and a plente-
ous series of unguents and medicaments,
 indeed, every material requisite for
life and luxury except food.
	The contributions of chemistry to
knowledge and welfare during the half-
century have been many, yet relatively
fewer and poorer than the rich returns
from other sciences; and it is a con-
spicuous fact that few American names
are connected with the greater advances
in the science. While Americas addi-
tions to astronomy, physics, geology,
and anthropology have been of the first
magnitude, modern chemistry remains a
monument to European genius almost
alone. In connection with this fact 
perhaps in explanation of it  it is to
be noted that there are no great chem-
ical laboratories in this couRtry, no in-
stitutions comparable with the astro-
nomical observatories and geological sur-
veys and natural history museums which
have given prestige to American science.

	Half a century ago geology was on
the plane to which it had been raised
by Lyells law of uniformism,  a law
which contributed much to the cult pro-
claimed by Tyndall and Huxley; and
this plane was effectively expanded by
the efforts of several American geolo-
gists. With singular perspicacity and
pertinacity, Hall and his associates devel-
oped an American scheme of rock classi
fication (the New York system), which
was expounded and crystallized by Dana,
and has since served as the model for
the continent; and in an address deliv-
ered in 1857, though not printed for a
generation, Hall foreshadowed the laws
of mountain-making and other distinc-
tive principles of modern geology. Thus,
within the first decade of the half-cen-
tury the earth science of America had
come to stand well abreast of that of
Europe. Checked by the social shock
of the early sixties, research rested; but
toward the end of the decade it began
anew, and as exploration pushed into
the Cordilleran region, where the Stone
Book lies open, it sprang forward with
unprecedented vigor. Hayden, King,
and Powell in the territories, and Whit-
ney in California, were the principal
pioneers in the field, while Powell, Gil-
bert, and Dutton led in lifting the sci-
ence to the third plane in its develop-
ment; for, through recognition of the
baselevel of erosion, they laid the
foundation for the New Geology, which
reads earth history from the forms of hill
and vale as well as from the formations
and fossils of past ages. Within a dozen
years the principles have been applied
and extended in the coast plains of the
southeastern states, where they have
made both land forms and unconformi-
ties eloquent records of continent growth;
while Davis, of Harvard, has success-
fully employed the same principles in
reading from topographic maps the later
chapters of earth history.
	Meantime, the glacial theory, import-
ed by Agassiz from Switzerland, rooted
kindly in American soil, and soon bore
fruit; Chamberlin, Shaler, Salisbury,
and a score of others have scanned our
incomparable drift plains and drumlins,
moraines and kames, sand plains and
paha, and have solved the riddle of
the bess; and during the last quarter-
century the records of the ice ages have
been more thoroughly scrutinized and
more fully interpreted in America than</PB>

Fifty Years of American Science.
in all the rest of the world. Mean-
time, too, geology ramified in other di-
rections, and its applications multiplied;
the second half of the nineteenth cen-
tury is distinguished by activity in in-
vestigation of rocks and resources in
every country, but especially in Amer-
ica, with its federal survey and score of
state surveys, maintained at a cost of
more than a million dollars annually, and
enricbing the nation at an indefinitely
larger rate. It is fair to remember that
the success of the science on this conti-
nent is largely due to the great conti-
nental expanse and the wide distribu-
tion of resources in the rocks; that the
plateau region and the caiion country of
the southwest furnish the best known
record of geologic process; that the Ap-
palachian region affords the worlds
finest example of a distinctive type of
structure; that the glaciated plains of
the northern United States are among
the widest in the world, by far the widest
of those equally accessible; also, that
our coal and iron, gold and silver, oil
and gas, and numberless other valuable
minerals tempt curiosity and cupidity, as
well as serious inquiry from sea to sea.
While the opportunities are unsurpassed,
there has been no dearth of genius to
seize them; and while America may still
take lessons from Europe in mineralogy
and perhaps in petrography, the relation
is reversed in other departments and in
the principles of the science, and lead-
ing European geologists take frequent
field lessons on this side the Atlantic.

	Hardly a serious question as to the
eternal fixity of species and genera and
orders had been raised in scientific minds
before 1848, save by Lamarek and a
few other quasi - visionaries, while con-
servative leaders like Agassiz in Switzer-
land, Cuvier in France, and Owen in
England were so deeply grounded in the
philosophy of fixity as only to be the
more firmly set by each shock of new
discovery. Just ten years later Darwin
and Wallace independently announced
the inconstancy of species and the de-
rivation of organic units through succes-
sive changes; and the idea grew, until it
wrought, within a quarter-century, the
most profound revolution in the history
of human thought. This effect was not
due alone to Darwins wealth of facts
and uprightness of record, nor was it
due in more than partial measure to
Huxleys eloquent and aggressive advo-
cacy. The discovery of the conservation
of energy by Joule and Grove, and its ex-
position by Tyndall, contributed much;
Lyells doctrine of uniformism strength-
ened the movement in many circles; the
extension of chemistry to organic com-
pounds was a potent factor; the en-
largement of the known universe by the
spectroscope had its effect; while all
these combined with the habit of thought
established through larger associations
of thinkers with practical men and with
mechanical devices, so that the formula
the uniformity of nature won common
assent. The wide and ready acceptance of
the Darwinian doctrine was but the co-
ordination of knowledge already gained.
Yet the revolution would have been long
delayed had Englishmen alone contrib-
uted to it, or even men of Continental Eu-
rope; for, with a half dozen exceptions,
the earliest and strongest apostles were
Americans, with Asa Gray and Morse
among the leaders. Tbe free, vigorous,
and trenchant American mind was pe-
culiarly hospitable to the tenets of the
new law; and it was accepted here as
the foundation for the cult of science
years before it was similarly accepted
in Great Britain. Seen in the perspec-
tive now possible, Darwins doctrine is
but the extension into the organic realm
ef the laws of action and sequence which
form the basis of all definite thought,
and find their highest expression in that
power of invention which enables man
to dominate duller nature for his own
behoof. Thus, the rise of the doctrine
merely marked a normal and necessary</PB>

stage in the development of knowledge
concerning the several realms of nature.
	Made definite by the recognition of
action and sequence, biology has ad-
vanced apace during the last quarter-
century. The causes of most ills to which
flesh is heir have been traced to germs
and microbes, and modes of prevention
and cure have resulted; the nature of
sepsis has been found out, and anti-
sepsis has been perfected with such ra-
pidity that its leader (Lord Lister) has
lived to see the average civilized life
lengthened by months through efforts
initially his own; and both medicine
and surgery have been reconstructed.
Entomology has traced the laws govern-
ing insect life, suggesting methods of
successfully opposing physical force to
insect activity, and even of opposing in-
sect to insect in such manner as to pro-
tect and multiply the crops on which the
nations are fed. Phytology has made
clear the laws of plant life, indicating
ways of fertilizing and hybridizing and
even reproducing useful plants,  ways
more economical than those of nature;
while zoilogy is daily applied in re-cre-
ating and perpetuating needful domestic
animals. The science of living things is
too broad and its lines are too many for
full statement in a brief summary; but its
results may be summed in saying that it
has taught man to control life almost at
will,  annihilating it if bad, and pre-
serving it if good,  and has enabled
him to subjugate vitality to his needs
even more completely than the physical
forces are subjugated. As a science sim-
ply, biology abounds in problems of pro-
found interest; as an applied science, its
uses and benefactions are incalculable.

	Half a century ago a shadow ob-
scured a considerable part of the field
of science, seriously obstructing its cul-
tivation; it was the shadow cast by man
himself, then held too sacred to serve as
suitable subject for scientific research.
In 1863 Huxley published Mans Place
in Nature, and an anthropological soci-
ety was instituted in London and began
the issue of a journal; eight years later
Darwin published The Descent of Man.
These events marked the gradual lift-
ing of the shadow from science, the slow
extension of the law of the uniformity
of nature to the human organism. Con-
tributions came from other countries;
Herbert Spencer bent his fertile mind
and facile pen to inquiry and exposition;
America awoke rapidly; and within a
quarter-century anthropology was regu-
larly classed as one of the sciences. At
first man was studied simply as an ani-
mal, and men were classed in races de
fined by characters shared with brutes.
A notable advance was forecast when
students perceived that man occupies a
distinct plane, in that his essential attri-
butes are collective rather than individ-
ual; and the American Morgan laid
the foundation for objective sociology in
his work on Ancient Society in 1877,
while the Frenchman Comte formulated
a subjective sociology, and the Briton
Spencer pushed forward his imposing
folios on Descriptive Sociology. Then
came the creation of the Bureau of
American Ethnology in 1879, and the
beginning of the classification of the
American aborigines by human activi-
ties rather than by animal features. So
arose a New Ethnology, in which men
are classified by mind rather than by
body, by culture rather than by color;
and the rise marked the most notable
advance in the history of anthropology.
Under this classification, the peoples of
the earth fall into four culture grades,
which are also stages in development,
namely: (1) savagery, with a social or-
ganization resting on kinship reckoned
in the female line; (2) barbarism, in
which the social organization is based
on kinship reckoned in the male line;
(3) civilization, in which the organiza-
tion has a territorial basis; and (4) en-
lightenment, in which the laws and cus-
toms are based on intellectual rights.</PB>

	The principal advance in anthropolo-
gy was distinctly American; it grew out
of conditions existing alone on this con-
tinent, and could not well have origi-
nated elsewhere; indeed, it is not yet
fully appreciated in any other country.
Like the American geologist, the cis-
atlantic anthropologist found the finest
field the world affords. With a pop-
ulation coming from every European
country, with an aboriginal people of
threescore tongues and a thousand tribes
always on his frontier, with the denizens
of the dark continent long chained to
his footstool, with representatives of
China and Japan and the islands of the
seas constantly competing in his indus-
tries, and with a more extensive and in-
timate blending of bloods than any stu-
dent had seen before, his opportunities
for testing ethnic principles were un-
paralleled; when lost in the labyrinth
of meaningless distinctions of color and
hair, of cranial form and capacity, of
stature and length of limb, and in need
of new criteria, he was inspired to note
what men do rather than what they are,
and soon followed the physicist and the
chemist and the geologist into kinetic
interpretation. Then he found a third
of the thousand aboriginal tribes in the
stage of maternal organization, another
third in paternal organization, and the
remaining third ranging through transi-
tional conditions of such sort as to show
the courseof development. At the same
time, he found inbred traditions of ter-
ritorial organization shaping habit and
thought in the million immigrants and
visitors from monarchical nations; and
he alone hm~d constantly before him the
object-lesson of governmental control
despite  and indeed by virtue of 
intellectual and social and political free-
dom. Our physical progress has been
great because invention is encouraged
by free institutions; our progress in geo-
logy has been rapid by reason of intel-
lectual freedom and a vast domain;
while our progress in anthropology has
been marvelous because of the elevated
point of view and an incomparable range
of types both of blood and of activity.
	The main movements made way for
others, especially in connection with the
aborigines; the sources of ~esthetics and
ethics have been successfully sought,
the early steps in the course of industri-
al development have been traced, the
beginnings of law have been analyzed,
and the course of human development
has been brought to light; and it is now
known that the lines of human progress
in the arts and industries, in sociology,
in language, and in thought are conver-
gent, rather than divergent like the lines
of development among beasts and plants,
and that the unification of ideas by tele-
graph and telephone and press is but a
ripple marking the course of the great
stream of human activity. The conver-
gent lines of progress suggest multipli-
city of cradle-places for the American
tribes, as recently expounded by Powell,
and still more for mankind in gene~ral.
Endogamy and exogamy have been de-
fined, in the light of careful observa-
tion, as correlative regulations among
given peoples rather than developmental
stages; matriarchy has been shown to
be the complement of patriarchy, and
not a rival of avuncular control; while
the trite  marriage - by - capture has
been reduced to due place as an inci-
dental development rather than a prim-
itive condition of mating. Meantime, a
sound basis has been given to American
arckeology, as just attested by the award
of the first Loubat prize to Holmes in
recognition of distinctively American
work. The view afforded by the recog-
nition of the collective character of man-
kind has guided inquiry concerning the
individual, and now bodily structures are
studied as products of mind-led activity,
while the brain is studied as a mechan-
ism more complex, but otherwise no more
mysterious, than the structures of plants
and animals, or devices which mcmi have
made. So in the science of man as in</PB>

the other sciences the magicians wand
has been cast aside, and the veil of mys-
tery has fallen away forever, and the
early shadow is gone from the field of
definite knowledge.

	Such have been a few of the advances
in science of the half-century; the dis-
covery of the persistence of motion, the
invention of spectroscopy, the control of
electricity, the discovery of the periodic
law, the recognition of evolution, and
the culture classification of mankind
may be considered the first half-dozen.
If summed in a single term, the half-
centurys advance in science may be ex-
pressed as recognition of the uniformi-
ty and potentiality of nature; while the
applications are invention on the prac-
tical side, and kinetic interpretation (or
interpretation in terms of motion and
sequence) on the philosophic side. Most
of the advances began in Europe, to be
hastened in America, and a full half of
the progress must be cr5dited to cis-
atlantic genius and enterprise.
	In truth, America has become a nation
of science. There is no industry, from
agriculture to architecture, that is not
shaped by research and its results; there
is not one of our fifteen millions of fam-
ilies that does not enjoy the benefits of
scientific advancement; there is no law
in our statutes, no motive in our con-
duct, that has not been made juster by
the straightforward and unselfish habit
of thought fostered by scientific meth-
ods. A nation of free minds will not
be selfish or cruel; and the sense of uni
formity in nature finds expression in
national character,  in commercial hon-
esty, in personal probity, in unparalleled
patriotism, as well as in the unequaled
workmanship which is the simplest ex-
pression of straight thinking. Every
step in our national progress has been
guided by the steadfast knowledge born
of assimilated experience. The tre-
bling of population in a half-century,
raising the republic from an experiment
in state-making to a leading place among
the nations, is the wonder of history;
the thrice-trebled wealth and educational
facilities gained through application of
new knowledge are a marvel, before
which most men stand dazzled at home,
and wholly blinded abroad; the three
times thrice-trebled knowledge itself, lift-
ing the nation high in enlightenment and
making way for still more rapid pro-
gress, is a modern miracle wrought by
scientific work; but greatest of all in
present potency and future promise is
the elevation of moral character attained
by that sense of right thinking which
flows only from consciously assimilated
experience,  and this is the essence of
science now diffused among our people.
	Since American science was young,
the course of research and conclusion
has been guided by an association of
science-builders who have freely contrib-
uted their mental and moral riches to
their younger and poorer fellows. This
association has shaped the progress of
American science, and its semi-centen-
nial anniversary is Americas Jubilee of
Science.

country. They were made Spanish
markets only by excluding the products
and shipping of other powers, thus for-.
cing upon the consumers in these islands
the manufactures of Spain. This was
readily accomplished by framing the co-
lonial customs ta~iffs on a double plan.
Under one and a lower set of duties,
Spanish products were admitted; under
another set of duties, penal in their
amount, foreign products were kept at
a distance, and competition was out of
the question. The same system of dif-
ferential or discriminating duties was
applied to shipping; and thus it hap-
pened that, as a rule, only a vessel fly-
ing the Spanish flag could find a profit
in the colonial trade. The introduction
of foreign capital was discouraged, and
under the incompetency of Spanish
agents any management entrusted to
them was hazardous, almost inviting
failure. While it was insisted that the
colonies should purchase only Spanish
manufactures, no market in the Penin-
sula was maintained for colonial pro-
ducts. The leading interests of the pos-
sessions were obliged to seek their own
markets, outside of Spain, and in the
face of the worlds competition. Buy-
ing all that they consumed, even the
flour for their bread, under a monopoly
system, they sold what they raised or
manufactured in open market. Only
one product appeared to be favored, 
Spain did purchase Cuban tobacco. The
favor was illusory, as the tobacco r4gime
was framed for the benefit of those at
home, with little regard for the interests
of the tobacco-grower. With these con-
ditions, it has been impossible to gauge
the abilities of the islands to produce or
consume, for they must be tested under
some system other than monopoly.
	In the face of this ignorance of actual
economic power, it is easier to take too
sanguine a view of the possible power
than calmly to weigh influences and
estimate a new distribution of ability.
Whatever have been the defects of the
commercial policy applied to these pos-
sessions and to China, certain lines of
production have been adopted as best
suited to the soil, climate, and form of
labor. Like other forces, economic
forces work along the lines of least re-
sistance. It would be a long story to
relate why Cuba grows sugar and to-
bacco as her leading products, or the
Philippines sugar and hemp, or China
tea and silk; but for more than a century
these articles have been closely associ-
ated with those countries, and have fed
their foreign trade. They come into the
market with clearly defined commercial
uses, for which experience of many years
proves them to be best suited. Under a
new control, Cuba will still send to the
market sugar, fruit, and tobacco; Porto
Rico will still offer sugar and coffee; the
Ladrones will go on in the growing of
cocoanuts; and Manila hemp and sugar
will still form the contribution of the
Philippines to commerce.
	What may be changed is the relation
of the native to the responsible producer,
a delicate problem certain to arise in the
Spanish islands. The introduction of
foreign capital, and the extraordinary
activity that follows the opening of a
new and promising field of investment,
will create a demand for labor very dif-
ferent from that now existing. The
white races of Europe have found it diffi-
cult to live in the tropics, and they con-
stitute a very small though ruling ele-
ment of the population. Even when they
have attempted to amalgamate with the
natives, the descendants have soon lost
their inherited energy, and dropped back
into the ranks of the lowest cultiva-
tors or idlers. In this dilemma aid has
been sought from the outside. Slavery,
and subsequently coolie labor, prevailed
in Cuba. In the Philippines slavery
does not exist, and never has existed;
but the native races have no initiative,
and are subject to an invariable routine
and discipline, such as the priestly or-
ders enforced in California and Para</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00329" SEQ="0329" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="323">New Opportunities for American Commerce.	323

guay. This rule is not favorable to
economic activity, and little progress ap-
pears to have been made in using the
resources of the islands. The Chinese
have migrated to those parts just as they
have crept down the Asiatic peninsula,
giving an abundant and cheap form of
labor. It is hardly desirable, however,
to resort to them further, even though
they now form the real labor supply of
the islands. A European control of the
Philippines might not be particular as
to the kind of labor it obtained, but
the attitude of Australia and the United
States toward the Chinese is too pro-
nounced to be modified.
	A lesson may be learned from the
policy of the Dutch in Java. Whether
the conclusion could be applied to the
Spanish islands is doubtful, for the sys-
tem was adopted more than seventy
years ago, when very different ideas of
the responsibility of the state to its sub-
jects were entertained. For many years
after claiming Java the Dutch were only
merchants in their East Indian posses-
sions, opening factories and establishing
trading - centres, but not assuming any
control over the natives, or imposing
upon them the task of cultivating the
lands for the benefit of Dutch commerce.
The mercantile company trading with
the island was a monopoly, and almost
held a monopoly in the worlds supply of
spices; but it was a commercial organi-
zation only, and not a political or admin-
istrative instrument. After the com-
pany had ceased to exist, the govern-
ment of the Netherlands introduced a
system of colonial management for its
own benefit, not unattended with suc-
cess. The government merely took the
places of the native kings or rulers, re-
ceiving their tributes or levies, reducing
these potentates to salaried agents of
the administration. The king of a pro-
vince thus stood between his people and
the government, and acted as revenue
collector for the latter. The levies were
one fifth of the years product, and one
days labor in every five, from each cul-
tivator.
	In realizing the new relations thus
entered into by Holland, the authori-
ties directed that one fifth of the land
subject to the levy should be devoted
to such products only as found favor in
the markets of Europe, as coffee, sugar,
tobacco, indigo, tea, and certain spices.
The commodities raised on this land
were sold at a profit in Holland, giving
a handsome revenue to the state, and
feeding a colonial commerce of some mag-
nitude. In course of time this system
was modified. It was seen that the
highest profits were obtained from coffee
and sugar, and the government lands
were devoted to those crops. The trib-
ute of labor could be commuted, and
greater freedom was accorded to indi-
vidual cultivators, on condition of their
selling one fifth of their crops to the of-
ficials, and even a larger proportion of
the product at a mean price. At the pre-
sent time the corvee applies only to coffee
lands, and the exports of individuals far
exceed those of the government. There
is little doubt that this system has done
much to build up the commerce of Java,
and has produced a practical solution of
the labor problem. The native was in-
terested and encouraged in his plant-
ing, and the state obtained large profits
through a long period of time. The de-
cay of the sugar industry would offer one
serious obstacle to any extension of the
system, and private initiative could not
apply its leading features to the Philip-
pines without resorting to means but lit-
tle short of slavery.
	In each instance the native population
is stationary in civilization. Indian,
Chinese, and Malayan are alike in pre-
senting few promises of awakening. A
stagnating civilization is modified -with
difficulty, for custom has become well-
nigh absolute, and determines even the
particular activity of the individual in
the community. In British India is to
be seen a remarkable instance of such a</PB>

modification, but the results are as yet
in an embryonic form. The mere con-
quest of the many tribes of that vast
and varied empire was a problem of sec-
ondary importance to that of governing
them after conquest. The occupation of
territory sparsely settled by native tribes
of nomads, or tribes lightly held to one
locality, was a familiar experience in
colonization, and the general course of
events led to a solution acceptable to the
colonists, however repulsive to the moral
sense. The natives were exterminated
or contracted into a few settlements, en-
tirely subordinated to the newcomers,
and protected in much the same manner
in which a disappearing species of animal
is preserved. They are not sufficiently
strong to offer resistance to the change,
nor are they possessed of such cohesion
as to present a serious obstacle to being
governed as wards of the nation, with-
out any share whatever in the govern-
ment or any voice in the disposal of their
own property. The American Indian
has long been in a similar position of in-
feriority, and the same conditions were
found in Australia and exist in South
Africa.
	In India another set of problems pre-
sented itself. The economy of the com-
munities of natives bad become rigid
through centuries of inertia. The rule of
custom, absolute and unchangeable, was -
as opposed to the freer system of contract
of the West as the mental attitude of
the East was opposed t~ that of the in-
vaders and conquerors. In the attempt
to introduce into India the principles of
government as understood in England,
strange anomalies were encountered, not
only neutralizing the good expected from
the change, but producing such confusion
as to give greater opportunity for injus-
tice and oppression than could have oc-
curred under the customary rule of the
native princes. Years of careful study
and intelligent experiment were required
to devise a working system, and the pro-
cess is still going on, for the subject now
bristles with difficulties awaiting adjust-
ment.
	A measure of success has followed
this application of an administrative sys-
tem to an alien and not receptive people.
The economic consequences alone con-
cern us, but they are necessarily con-
nected with, and more or less dependent
upon, the moral and social results. In
place of diminishing in numbers, the na-
tives are increasing so rapidly as to ex-
cite anxious forebodings in their govern-
ors. Now that they are freed from war,
and relieved in part from the periodical
recurrence of plague and famine,  not
very long ago recognized as inevitable
incidents,  few natural checks to the
growth of population remain in force.
Crowded as many parts of the empire are,
the entire country threatens to become
a huge congested district through the
large birth-rate and the immovability of
the population. The problem of employ-
ing this mass of humanity solved itself
under native rule. A great part, rang-
ing from eighty to ninety-five per cent,
according to the province, was connected
with the cultivation of the land and de-
pendent upon its produce. The other
part of the population lived by house-
hold industry, catering to the wants of a
village or restricted territory outside of
the village, and making and selling un-
der the iron laws of custom.
	About 1860 it was noticed that this
household industry was suffering in many
branches through outside competition, a
factor almost unknown in India up to
that time. The bazaars no longer dealt
in native cloth, but displayed the cottons
of the English looms. The metal-work
of the Indian was supplanted by the pro-
ducts of Birmingham. The hand-work-
ers of the East could not compete with
the machinery of the West, and so they
were gradually crowded from their mar-
kets and occupations, and driven to seek
a living from the land, already tilled
to its utmost capacity. The added bur-

threatened to produce a crisis, and would
have done so had it not been for the
phenomenal though temporary profits
of cotton culture. The failure of the
United States to grow even a share of
its usual cotton crop gave India its op-
portunity. At the end of our civil war,
India continued to raise cotton and to
manufacture it on an experimental scale.
Jute, rising into great commercial im-
portance because of its cheapness and
suitability for many purposes, gave an-
other commercial interest and manufac-
turing industry. Finally, wheat added
its somewhat uncertain profits, creating
employment for many native agricultur-
ists, and furnishing an article of export
whenever the wheat markets of Europe
were in need of a further supply. In
this manner, after nearly forty years of
slow development, India has corrected the
tendency of foreign competition to crowd
the entire population upon the land, and
not only produces enough food for its
own people, but is a large and increas-
ingly important exporter of manufac-
tured cotton and jute.
	This record of industrial change has
been dwelt upon, because it presents in
a clear light certain difficulties to be
encountered in seeking to develop the
commerce and industry of such a coun-
try as China, where the conditions of
population are not unlike those found in
India. It is true the village community
is not so important a social factor, and
the population is freer in its movement
and thought. The beliefs and supersti-
tions of the Chinese have opposed in the
past all attempts to introduce the mech-
anism of modern progress, and there is
little reason to expect any notable re-
duction in this opposition for the pre-
sent. The passive Indian permitted the
construction of military roads, railroads,
and canals of navigation and irrigation,
with only a dim perception of what they
might mean, and eventually with a ready
acceptance of what they migbt offer.
The Chinese see in worJ~s of a like na
ture a violation of their most cherished
beliefs, and a most potent agency for in-
troducing and fastening upon them the
influence of the hated foreigner. Con-
cessions for railroads have been granted,
and are being granted; and trading and
mining privileges are still extorted from
the court of Peking. The immensity of
the field to be worked, and the local obsta-
cles studiously interposed to the accom-
plishment of these undertakings, make
a realization of the hopes of the under-
takers somewhat distant and problemat-
ical.
	Given the means of transportation, it
does not follow that a new market of
import or export would spring into being.
Even the food of the Chinese, rice and
beans, cannot be of European or Ameri-
can origin; and meats, one of the great
articles of export from the United States,
will find no market in the East. As to
manufactured goods, at the very thresh-
old of the Chinese market stands Japan,
eager and able to seize upon every open~
ing offered. It must be remembered,
also, that at the peace Japan obtained
the privilege of erecting mills and manu-
factories in Chinese ports,  a privi-
lege as yet unused, because of the de-
termined opposition encountered. If a
neighboring state, whose people are in
a better position to understand the wants
of China, cannot make its advantage
from this privilege, how unreasonable it
is to expect a distant and very alien peo-
ple to get more favorable results!
	Japan is yearly becoming of greater
importance in the commerce of Asia,
and with a twofold effect. On the one
hand, her growing industries buy more
foreign materials, such as American cot-
ton and Indian yarn, English machinery
and American petroleum; to that extent
her progress is reflected in the widening
commercial relations with the United
States and Europe. On the other hand,
this very progress serves as a barrier to
extending the foreign trade of China
with Western powers. The machinery</PB>

obtained from Europe and the raw mate-
rials secured from the United States are
employed in manufacturing for China
and other parts of Asia, at the expense of
the countries of the West. More than
that, Chinese trade suffers through the
competition of Japan, the result of a more
intelligent application of science to some
of the leading products of that country.
In any estimate of the commercial possi-
bilities of the East, due prominence must
be given to the ability of Japan to reap
the larger share of any gain.
	If the opportunities offered to Amer-
ican trade on the continent of Asia
promise little, will such islands as the
Philippines give better results? The
market for our products will be small,
limited to supplying the wants of a few
white settlers. The native Malayans do
not make any demand for manufactured
goods, and their wants are of the most
primitive description. The supposition
that the islands are so rich in minerals
that a new population will flow in is one
as yet not proven, and at best could not
create a market commensurate with the
predictions of those who believe that
trade follows the flag.
	Until a new population is introduced
into the islands, and the industrial spirit
of China awakened into activity on new
lines, the existing conditions will supply
whatever trade will demand. Before
there can be such a development of
commerce as the more sanguine count
upon, China must pass through the same
change that British India and Japan have
endured. No merely colonial r~gime,
in which the lands and people are re-
garded as plantations, to be exploited as
Java and Cuba have been, will suffice.
A great social revolution, one of far-
reaching results, must be initiated and
superintended until it is well under way.
The lessons of the Dutch and English
in the East deserve careful study, be-
cause they represent serious and on the
whole successful attempts to solve the
problem of ruling an inferior people in
such a way as to bring into force a latent
economic power. If it is concluded that
the policies of Germany and Russia, so
far as they can be known, do not con-
tain this fertile germ of colonization for
the benefit of the governed as well as of
the governors, these countries are not de-
sirable occupants and controllers of Asia.
If the extreme tariff policy of the United
States is to be applied to such posses-
sions as may fall to it at the termination
of this war, the highest and most desired
results cannot be attained. A century
ago the colony or dependency alone had
duties to perform, and duties almost en-
tirely commercial; to - day the respon-
sibility has been shifted to the mother
country, and is mainly political. The
creation of self-supporting and self-gov-
erning communities is the end of coloni-
zation. In this light Great Britain and
Spain represent the two extremes; for
Spain has never left a possession in a
position of self-sufficiency. Only through
revolutions could a stable government
be secured.
	If political control, with its many and
serious responsibilities, be set aside, an
alternative presents itself. An open port
in the Philippines, it is urged, would
give our exporters a fulcrum for secur-
ing immense benefits from the Asiatic
trade. In support of this view the ex-
perience of the English in Hong Kong
is accepted as conclusive. The plea is
on its face a promising one. Since 1881
the tonnage of shipping in the foreign
trade entering and clearing at Hong
Kong has more than doubled in quantity,
and the shipping of England has more
than held its own in the increase. The
actual movement of merchandise at this
port is not recorded, and only indirect
evidence can be obtained from the re-
turns of other countries. As it natu-
rally forms a distributing centre for the
China coast trade, the returns of that
empire should be first consulted. The
value of imports into China from Hong
Kong has nearly trebled since 1881, and</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00333" SEQ="0333" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="327">New Opportunities for American Commerce.	327
the same rate of increase has held for
exports from China to the free port.
The transactions of Japan with Hong
Kong have nearly doubled, and are in-
creasing every year at a rapid rate. So
far the record is clear, and points to the
advantages of a free or open port. No
light is thrown on the principal point to
be determined,  how far has England,
or the United States, or Germany bene-
fited by this increase?
	Take British India, a possession that
has much to turn intJ its commerce with
its neighbors, and a decided advantage
over distant rivals in geographical posi-
tion. The entire export movement to
Hong Kong, including merchandise and
specie, on private and government ac-
count, was less in 1896 than it was in
1882, and the import movement had not
materially altered, showing, if anything,
a tendency to decrease. The mother
country gives an even more discourag-
ing showing. The exports of British
goods to this Asiatic port have fallen off
in value by one half since 1881, and the
imports by one third. The entire trade
forms but a very small item in the total~
movement of Englands foreign com-
merce. The United States might be
looked upon as somewhat more favored
than the United Kingdom in its trade
relations with the East, but it has not
derived material benefit from this de-
velopment of Hong Kong. The imports
into the United States have decreased
more than one third in a period of seven-
teen years, and the exports to Hong
Kong have increased in about the same
proportion. With this change, Hong
Kong figures in the total trade of the
United States for less than four tenths
of one per cent,  a proportion hardly
worth considering. Even Germany,
with its restless and pushing commercial
policy, passes over Hong Kong, and
seeks to build up its interests in China
itself, with only partial success. In the
face of such a showing, covering a series
of years marked by an almost phenome
nal increase in the worlds commerce,
it is difficult to accept the theory of a
free port in the Philippines as an agency
to increase the importance of the United
States in the East. Asia is feeding Asi-
atic trade, and will continue to do so
without respect to any outside agency.
Asia must cease to be Asia before the
West can participate in its development.
	The prospect of gain to ourselves be-
comes even less when the contingency
of a partition of China among European
powers is presented. If we regard re-
cent experiments in colonization, that of
the French in Tonquin must be taken as
an example of a decided failure. No
one of the benefits anticipated from con-
quest has followed the occupation of the
land, and they seem as remote to-day as
they ever have been. The genius of the
French people has not shown itself in
their colonial settlements, and the desire
to exploit the new possessions by com-
panies enjoying special and monopoly
concessions has given a flavor of job-
bery little creditable to the administra-
tion of these dependencies. A number of
such companies, and a host of function-
aries sent out from France to govern
the colonies, have produced a policy
costly and wearisome to the home gov-
ernment, distasteful to the people, who
are not inclined to emigrate, and pro-
ductive of profit only to a favored few.
Whether in Tonquin or Madagascar, the
result has been the same, and only in
Algiers does France enjoy the sem-
blance of successful management of a
dependency.
	The advent of Germany and Russia
as claimants to a large share of the
apparently moribund empire of China
would mean the practical exclusion of
the United States from such markets as
should fall under the control of those
powers. In this they would only be
following the example set to them by
our tariff policy, and our government
would be in no position to protest while
that policy remains in force. The pos</PB>

sible union or combination of England,
Japan, and the United States against
the Russian and German claims, terri-
torial and commercial, could only post-
pone the event, not alter the current of
the inevitable. Germany might secure a
foothold in China, but it would be not un-
like that now enjoyed by France. She
would represent an alien race, with no
sympathies for the subject people, and
more intent upon aggrandizement of
self than upon the establishment of a
dependency, to become in the future a
self-governing state. An outlet for her
teeming population, and a market for
the ever rising tide of home manufac-
tures, already dependent upon foreign
demands for profit, would be her first
aim. A purely commercial colony has
little excuse for existing, and is more
apt to end in disaster than with credit
to the state recognizing it. Even Eng-
land, with a vast and varied record in
all forms of colonizing, cannot regard
the Niger or the South Africa company
an unalloyed success. Russia, with its
genius for controlling Asiatic peoples,
itself a power more AsiatIc than Euro-
pean, will prove of greater political
strength in China than Germany, but
even less disposeA to share commercial
privileges with the outside world. Mod-
ern diplomacy is commercial and finan-
cial rather than political.
	Under existing conditions, in which
the United States enjoys in Chinese
ports commercial privileges equal to
those of any other power, the share of
the trade coming to us is small,  only
four per cent of the imports and twelve
per cent of the exports. Were it not for
silk and tea, the exports would be re-
duced by more than one half, and would
be confined to opium, sugar, and a few ar-
ticles so distinctively Chinese that they
could not be obtained from any other
country. With the gradual decay of
the sugar trade, and the successful com-
petition from Japan and Italy in silk, no
decided increase in the takings of thesc
commodities may be expected. On the
other side, that of imports, petroleum
and cotton cloths give the greatest part
of the values from the United States.
In each of these articles competition is
encountered. The Russian oil is mak-
ing inroads into the Asiatic markets,
but not to the exclusion of the Ameri-
can product. Japan and British India
manufacture a cloth equally well adapted
for the Chinese market, and it is believed
at a lower cost than the American goods.
This advantage, now slight, may be in-
creased as the wants of the market are
better known, and the cotton industry
of Japan is better equipped in labor and
machinery.
	It is not in Asia that new opportu-
nities for American commerce should
be sought. A monopoly, even partial in
its nature, of the Cuban and Porto
Rican markets would offer far larger
returns in a year than a long period
of Asian trade. Not finding a market
in Spain for their chief products, these
islands sought others, and the United
States naturally absorbed a good part.
In sugar here was the only market;
and under the stimulus of free sugar
the cultivation of the cane was greatly
extended in Cuba, often with American
capital. In 1894 nearly one half of
the entire import of sugars into the
United States was obtained from Cuba,
and it is stated with confidence that a
continuance of a free market would have
led to a growth in the island sufficient
to meet all the needs of this country,
or more than four and a half billion
pounds a year. In tobacco, in fruit,
in coffee, and in all tropical products,
the two possessions now slipping from
Spain could rise to any demand made
upon them. Nor is this an idle boast,
though savoring of exaggeration. The
existing populatiorrs of the islands would
not be equal to it, and the scheme of
making them dependent on the United
States, whether under a protectorate o~
as annexed territory, looks to the intro-</PB>

duction of a more active and less inert
race, and the stimulus of larger capital,
working for its own gains rather than
for a band of foreign extortioners serving
as the administration. The trade of a
single year under favorable conditions
in the past  and they could be only
relatively favorable  has been six times
the amount of the trade of the United
States with China.
	Nor would the advantage be only on
the side of imports from these islands.
The West Indies have always looked to
the United States for certain supplies:
flour and fish and such meats as are
used, machinery, and wooden staves or
box-shooks for packing their sugar and
sugar products. The good quality of
these articles was quite as potent in de
termining the direction of the trade as
any question of actual cheapness. Early
in the century England sought to restrict
the transactions of her West Indies with
the United States, and inflicted lasting
damage upon their interests. Spain has
maintained the same policy in all its
vigor up to the present war, and has
sucked the life-blood from her colonies
by that tribute and a host of similar
taxes. The reciprocity agreement en-
t~red into with Spain in 1891 opened
the Cuban market to American flour,
and gave proof of the importance of
that market to our millers. Apart from
certain articles of luxury, the United
States could hold its own in the two
islands, and here will be found the true
openings for our commerce.

THE VIVISECTION OF CHINA.

	THE great events which are creating
such an excitement in the West Indies
over the last shreds of the ancient colo-
nial empire of Spain will undoubtedly
have consequences of extreme impor-
tance, and become, in the fullest sense of
the term, a part of history. But, how-
ever intense their interest, and however
marked the change which they are cer-
tain to occasion in the equilibrium of the
world, they remain altogether inferior in
real significance to the revolutions which
are taking place in the Far East.
	War of some sort between America
and Spain on the subject of Cuba had
long been unavoidable. No less than a
century ago,  at the time when France
lost her plantations in San Domingo,
and the republic of Hayti was born, 
it was easy to foresee the rupture of the
ties which had bound to the Spain of
Cortez and Pizarro the insular frag-
ments of the great hemisphere appro-
priated by Pope Alexander VI. The
various colonies were sure to break away,
one by one, from their metropolitan step-
mother, set up for themselves, and live
their own life. Cuba and Porto Rico,
sucked into the whirlpool of war, are but
accomplishing their manifest destiny,
and fulfilling the prophecies repeatedly
uttered by the historians of the last gen-
eration but one.
	The progress of events in the eastern
portion of the Asian continent had by
no means been so fully anticipated. One
might certainly have ventured to predict
that there, also, populations long crushed
by civil and military oppression would
one day lay claim to the rights of free

seen under what amazingly dramatic
conditions the claim would be asserted.

transform itself into a European pow-
er; European, at least, if not in lan-
guage, history, and traditions, in the
complete recasting of its administration,
institutions, customs, and theories, in its
devotion to science, and in its entire and
unreserved acceptance of a policy based
on observation and experience.
	This is the great event of the century,
 one which casts into the shade all
the other occurrences of an epoch which
has nevertheless been rich in memorable
events. And it will be no solitary ava-
tar; there are unmistakable signs that
other transformations of the same char-
acter are about to take place in the vast
empire of China, and in all those coun-
tries where inhabitants of different race,
yellow, red, or black, are brought into
close contact with the men of our own
Aryano - Greco - Latin civilization. So
vanishes that oft-repeated assertion of the
ethnologists, that race is a final and ir-
reducible fact, and that no possible pro-
gress in the perception of scientific or
moral truths can ever prevail against it.
It is from this point of view that the re-
cent history of the Far East presents phe-
nomena to which it behooves us to de-
vote our most serious attention.
	There are those, of course, who tell
us that all these events are illusory; that
the prodigious changes which have taken
place in the Japanese world are a lying
phantasmagoria and a vain show; that
the national mind and character have
undergone no real modification; and that
the Japanese are sure to escape, sooner
or later, from the sphere of European
attraction. We hear them compared to
savages, who, having learned in the
schools of London or Paris the customs
of civilization, make haste, as soon as
they get back to their forests and sa-
vannas, to cast aside their conventional
garments, and array themselves in the
toggery consecrated by ancestral instinct
and hereditary custom.
	Such assertions appear to us to rest
on a complete misconception of indis
putable facts. The Japanese have most
certainly entered into that realm of civili.
zation on which Bacon and Darwin have
set their seal; for if imperial caprice
and the spread of bourgeois fashions
have power to alter the external aspect
of a nation, such influences can have but
little effect on its underlying moral sense,
its religious beliefs, its educational the-
ories, and the essential principle of its
institutions. But it is precisely these
foundations of society which we have
seen removed. Japan has been shaken
to the very roots of its political and so-
cial being, and agents other than f ash-
ion or caprice have been called into play.
Is not the suppression of the feudal sys-
tem, and the substitution for it of a
bourgeois organization after the Europe-
an model, a fact of capital importance?
And how complete were the changes ef-
fected is shown by the fact that they
entailed a formidable reaction, and had
to be confirmed by domestic wars, revo-
lutions and counter-revolutions. The re-
sistance of the daimyc, or feudal lords,
and of the samurai, or lesser noblemen,
continued for fifteen years, and assumed
the proportions of a magnificent epic;
while the shock of contact between the
two societies was so violent as ultimate-
ly to shatter all the traditional moulds
handed down from the Middle Ages.
	These facts are no longer open to
question. The amazing, and until very
recently impossible spectacle has been
presented of mixed marriages,  that is
to say, between patricians and the pro-
letariat; and of schools where the sons
of noblemen and mechanics have sat side
by side, and applied themselves to the
solution of the same problems. Serfdom
was abolished, setting free two millions
of slaves, at the very momcnt when, by
the strangest of historical coincidences,
four millions of blacks recovered their
liberty in the United States of America;
and, by another curious freak of fate, it
was an American, Commodore Perry,
who, in 1853 and in the name of the</PB>

worlds commerce, forced the opening of
the Japanese ports, and thus became the
chief agent in a tremendous upheaval.
The tenure of property, the corner-stone
of the economic system, was also revo-
lutionized by the same blow. The land
no longer belongs to the state, and pea-
sant laborers become the virtual proprie-
tors of the soil on payment of a tax of
two and a half per cent. It is true that
there have been some obstacles to the
evolution of Japanese law in the direc-
tion of that Roman law, or personal
privilege of use and abuse, which gov-
erns Europe; and the fact that specula-
tors have seized the opportunity to buy
up large tracts of forest, moor, and other
waste land seems to open a vista of fu-
ture revolutions. But, on the other hand,
the remedy has grown up beside the evil,
and the pretensions of capital aiming at
an absolute sovereignty of labor are con-
fronted by Socialism, with all the shades
of opinion and tendency which it pre-
sents in the rest of the civilized world.
So remarkable is the coincidence of ideas
that the selfsame phrases appear to flow
spontaneously from the pens of two So-
cialist writers, who appeal to the work-
ingman, the one at Berlin, and the other
at Tokio or Yokohama.
	But the European art for which, un-
happily, the Japanese have shown most
aptitude is that of war. They have
learned with astonishing rapidity how
to handle firearms and bayonets, how to
load and fire cannon, how to equip na-
vies and conduct land manwuvres. In
short, they have become adepts in the
science of human slaughter. This peo-
ple, in whom the old instincts of the Ma-
lay pirate still survive here and there,
do great honor, unquestionably, to their
military instructors, trained in the Prus-
sian school. The Chinese despise the
islanders of Japan precisely on account
of their warlike spirit. They call them
Ow.hang, or brutes, and say that the
only two things they can do well are to
give a sword-thrust and make bang,
that is, let off firearms; and indeed, they
had dismal personal experience, during
the late war, of the homicidal talents of
their adversaries.
	The European influence which has
been so potent and so subversive in
Japan was bound to be equally so in
China, and, whatever the lovers of set
phrases may say to the contrary, it is
already working, powerfully and effec-
tively. But the enormous mass of the
Chinese continental empire represents
a body far more difficult to permeate
than the archipelago of Japan, which is
open on all sides. In the middle of the
present century, when the kingdom of
the Rising Sun had already entered de-
cisively upon its career of readjustment,
China, with a population at least ten
times as great as that of Japan, was able
to oppose a resistance ten or twelve times
as formidable as that of the latter, to
foreign elements of transformation; just
as the color of a liquid seems deeper or
paler to the eye according to the pro-
portion of pure water with which it is
mixed. If, as has been rashly said,
China has indeed undergone no modifi-
cation by foreign influence, it is because
the government is petrified in the rou-
tine of a ceremonial ten centuries old.
But it should be remembered that every
essentially conservative government is,
for that very reason, a backward govern-
inent, one forced upon the nation; and
that it is among the depressed masses
that we have to look for its accomplished
work.
	In proof of what has really been
achieved among the lowest of the lowly
in China, we may mention first the great
revolt of the Tai-ping, which may have
been surpassed by previous revolutions
in the loss of life and the general destruc-
tion which it entailed, but which differs
from them all in having been of foreign
origin. The men who provoked the con-
flict that broke out in 1850, side by side
with the intestine disorders then agi-
tating Europe, were all of pure Chinese</PB>

race. Rejecting the precepts of their of-
ficial masters, these yellows were so
influenced by the propaganda Qf certain
missionaries, whom they but half under-
stood, that they adopted the Bible as
their sacred book, and caused parts of
it to be translated. They raised Jesus
Christ to the rank of their own gods, and
recognized the Protestants of Europe
and America as brethren in the faith.
They used reverently to recite the ten
great laws of Heaven, which are none
other than the ten commandments of the
Jews, translated very correctly, but with
one addition: Thou shalt not use un-
clean things; that is to say, opium and
tobacco. The communism of the primitive
Christians awoke in them certain long-
sleeping ancestral instincts, and caused
them to proclaim a community of goods,
and to devise a redistribution of landed
property among groups composed of
twenty-five families, who were all to live
together on a single domain. For four-
teen years they constituted an imperiuns
in imperio, and they would most assured-
ly have succeeded in altering the whole
equilibrium of the Chinese world had
they not accepted the guidance of a wild
visionary, who lost his wits under the
dizzying effects of power, and who, after
he bad become one of the persons in the
Holy Trinity, could deign to take no fur-
ther notice of the affairs of earth. They
also committed the mad mistake of reck-
lessly attacking the European settlements
along the coast. Europe, however, pre-
ferred dealing with the decrepit govern.
ment at Peking, whose foibles she under-
stood, and which was docile under her
orders, to entering upon an untried course
of wily diplomacy in order to reconcile
her own interests with those of a trans-
formed China; and troops of mercena-
ries of every nationality, commanded by
French, English, and American adven-
turers,  Brethon de Coligny, dAigue-
belle, Ward, Burgevine, Holland, and
Gordon,  undertook to quell the insur-
rection in the interests of the Manchu
nan government. Thus it was by aid
of the European element that official
China was enabled to put down a revolu-
tion largely due to European influence.
	Now, however, fifty years after the
revolt of the Tai-ping, changes of an-
other sort have been accomplished, 
changes all the more remarkable in that
they could never have come about save
by the consent of the entire nation. All
over the empire railways have been built
from city to city, under the direction of
red-haired engineers; and the popu-
lace has not arisen and stoned these vio-
lators of the ancestral graves. The Fang-
Choui  that is to say, the collective ge-
nii of earth, air, and water  have been
dethroned at the bidding of a more pow-
erful divinity. European industry has
conquered China, launching steamboats
on her rivers and erecting factories along
their banks, and it is to Chinese work-
men that the responsibility has been en-
trusted of managing and maintaining
these engines of revolution.
	Again, science  that genuine science
which observes, experiments, and com-
pares results  has penetrated into the
Chinese schools; and the geographers
among the Sons of Heaven have re-
signed themselves to the conviction that
China alone does not occupy nearly the
whole of the earths surface, while the
barbarians are relegated to nooks and
corners. Students of every description
are learning a new orientation of ideas:
their horizon is widening; to the study
of Confucius and other moral philoso-
phers they are adding that of the sa-
vants and the economists of to-day; they
are going on  it may be even too rash-
ly  to reform their medical practice.
All is movement and transformation.
The very music of our European artists,
to which the Chinaman was supposed to
be absolutely insensible, has finally pre-
vailed over his ancestral prejudices; and
Canton, Shanghai, Fu-chau, already show
a fine appreciation of the music of the
future. These are prodigious changes,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00339" SEQ="0339" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="333">	The Vivisection of China.	333

but they are due to the influi~nce of a
very small number of men. The foreign
element is increasing rapidly in Cbina,
but as yet there are not more than
twelve thousand civilized Europeans in
the entire empire; that is to say, one to
forty thousand Chinese. A quantity so
infinitesimal would be utterly without
importance, were it not that these for-
eigners, however lacking they may be, as
individuals, in nobility and seriousness
of purpose, are often, in spite of them-
selves, torch-bearers of learning and har-
bingers of ideas.
	The nation is being modified to its
depths, while the government remains
obstinately conservative; that cannot be
modified without going utterly to pieces.
The examinations for the mandarin-
ate are kept up exactly as of old; the
clumsy machine cannot adapt itself to
the complete change in its environment.
This is evident from the fact that the
capital of the empire has remained the
same since the Manchurian conquest;
whereas the political situation actually
required the choice of a new centre of
gravity whose defense could have been
more easily organized. Formerly, no
doubt, the strategic importance of Pe-
king, the Northern Residence, was
indisputable, because the dangers most
readily foreseen were those which men-
aced the northern frontier. The em-
perors of the Manchurian dynasty had
always reason to dread the warlike in-
habitants of their former country, no
less than the Mongolian hordes who were
perpetually descending from their high
tablelands, in the attempt to thrust the
Chinese back into the plains, and install
themselves in their place. This is why
the capital of the empire was long main-
tained so far to the north of its true
centre, which is that Flower of the
Midland comprised between the two
great rivers. The mandarins had to
leave the peaceable tribes to themselves,
in order to keep watch over their tur-
bulent neighbors.
	Behind these neighbors there loomed,
with the stern front of inflexible destiny,
a power more formidable than that either
of Manchurians or of Mongolians,  the
Niuscovite power. Up to the middle of
the present century the menace of Rus-
sia was still remote. Encroachment
along the seaboard was apparently much
more to be dreaded. While the Euro-
pean powers remained separated from
the Far East by the whole vast mass of
the continent, they had every facility for
approaching it by sea; and the countries
which it most behooved them to draw
within the sphere of their influence were
precisely the middle and southern pro-
vinces, the estuary of the Sikiang, the
bay of Hang-chau, and the mouths of
the Yang-tse. These, then, were the
threatened points, against which the
main resistance of the Chinese nation
ought by rights to have been directed;
and if that huge body had still possessed
organic life; if the official rulers of the
empire, with their hierarchy of manda-
rins, had not been mummified inside the
walls of their trebly inclosed city,  the
stately sepulchre of the court,  they
could not have failed to go forth and
meet the danger, as their predecessors
had done at critical times.
	A move toward Nanking, the South-
ern Residence, would have massed the
defensive forces of the state near the
chief centre of wealth and population.
Had the Chinese furnished such an ex-
ample of spirit and sagacity under the
impending peril, the internal dissensions,
which were so exacerbated during the
revolt of the Tai-ping, would have been
in a great measure avoided, and the
mandarins would never have had to un-
dergo the humiliation of entrusting the
defense of their people to mercenary
foreigners. Han-kau, the commercial
centre of 1~he empire, the depot for the
products of all the provinces, might also
hay, been well chosen; but from a strate-
gic point of view  for advantages both
of defense and of attack  the spot</PB>

indicated by nature was the city of Kiu-
kiang, perched upon a rocky peninsula
on the south bank of the Yang-tse, be-
tween that mighty stream and the inland
sea of Poyang, and traversed in all di-
rections by those navigable canals which
have given the great trading - centre
opened by the English to European com-
merce the name of the City of Riv-
ers. From this focal point, almost
equidistant from Nanking and Han-kan,
highways radiate in every direction, 
some by river routes, and some by moun-
tain passes: first, toward all points in
the great river basin of the Flower of
the South; then southeast in the direc-
tion of Fu-chau, southwest toward Can-
ton, and north toward Kai-feng and
Peking. But no! If ever the govern-
ment, now paralyzed by alarm, should
quit Peking, it would be to retreat to-
ward Singan; or rather, into the interior,
by the defiles of the liwang-ho. Such a
movement would be nothing more nor
less than fiighb  a final proof of irre-
mediable intimidation.
	And so, while the rulers of China,
shut up in their palaces, are allowing
themselves to be lulled into a fatal slum-
ber by the crooning of the old formu-
las, events are taking their course. At
the close of the Japanese war, the Em-
peror of China, who had been saved by
the intervention of the European pow-
ers, turned over and went to sleep again.
He was rudely awakened by a fresh ca-
lamity. One fine morning  it was the
4th of November, 1897  news arrived
that the Germans had seized the bay of
Kiao-chau, on the southern side of the
peninsula of Shan-tung. The choice
was unquestionably the best that could
have been made, and this important
event was probably determined by the
advice of the eminent geographer Richt-
hofen. It is true that this bay does not
open directly upon the Gulf of Pechili,
and does not appear to command the
city of Peking; but appearances are
deceitful. The position of Kiao-chau
combines what would seem to be oppo-
site advantages. Situated nearer the
centre of China and its fertile plains
than the towns on the Gulf of Pechili, it
is at the same time more easily acces-
sible from the high seas; and it also
communicates with the northern district
by means of a level region, extremely
busy and populous, where nothing would
be easier than to construct a railway, and
where advantage might even be taken
of the bed of an ancient stream to dig
a canal which would require no locks.
Kiao-chau would thus be connected with
the opposite shore of the Gulf of Pc-
chili, and would command two seas. If
this natural highway were closely guard-
ed by German troops, it would cut off,
so to speak, from the continent all the
mountainous region to the east of Shan-
tung, and it would sever from the em-
pire and virtually absorb the extensive
territory comprising the great port of
Chi - fu and the much disputed milita-
ry position of Wei-hai-wei. Ten mil-
lions of people, together with strategic
and commercial points of the utmost im-
portance, have thus been detached, at
one blow, from China, and brought with-
in the sphere of German influence.
Moreover, Kiao.chau is the natural port
of a mining region extremely rich in
coal, and a concession has already been
obtained for the construction of several
railways which will ramify all over the
interior, even to the promised land of
the Yellow Sun.
	By way of parrying this master
stroke, which for the rest had been de-
livered with singular ostentation, Rus-
sia took an instantaneous resolve; and,
like Germany, she proceeded to seize
upon the port, or the assemblage of
ports, which offered the greatest politi-
cal advantages to herself. As a mat-
ter of fact, it does deeply concern Rus-
sia to get possession of the countries
which border upon her empire and its
dependencies. Now, continental Man-
churia, across which the Tsars engi</PB>

neers are already carrying the eastern
section of the trans-Siberian railway,
may almost be considered a part of
Holy Russia; all that is needed being
to add to tha territory already annexed
the peninsula of Liao - tung, a sharp
point, running out in the direction of
China, and aptly described upon the Chi-
nese maps by the name of The Sword.
Citadels, arsenals, and formidable re-
doubts occupy the extremity of the penin-
sula, offeriug safe shelter to the Russian
fleet, and easy access, at all times of the
year. Port Arthur and Talien-wan are
like two bolts which secure the approach
by sea to northern China, and Russia
can draw or withdraw them at her will.
Being essentially a continental power,
she can thus pursue her victorious march
across the continent of Asia without
having to double the peninsula of Corea.
Russian invasion, in this quarter, wears
the aspect of a rising tide. From Slav
to Mongolian, from Mongolian to China-
man, the transitions are insensible. The
southern frontier of Siberia is being al-
tered, so to speak, before our eyes, for
a distance of thousands of miles; the
fact being that the immense territory
comprising Kashgaria, Mongolia, and
Manchuria, which is being gradually
Russifled by the prestige of the White
Tsar, covers an extent of fifteen hundred
thousand square miles,  a territory al-
most seven times as large as France, and
containing a population of at least thirty
millions. It is plain that the balance of
the world is going to be greatly affected
by an historical phenomenon which at
first sight seemed unimportant.
	There is but one power, after Rus-
sia, which can aim with any chance of
success at the permanent annexation of
China, or even a portion of her territo-
ry, and that power is Japan. Stretch-
ing in a series of curves along the front
of the Chinese territory, the Japanese
archipelago offers a sort of preliminary
step to the shores of the Flower of the
Midland; and if the European powers
had not intervened to arrest the victors
in the late war, they would soon have
effected a solid lodgment upon the Chi-
nese coast. But the fragment of the con-
tinent on which their hearts are specially
set is the peninsula of Corea, which, by
its formation and its position between
two gulfs, seems rather to belong to the
collective insular territory of the Ris-
ing Sun. Even now, in their childishly
boastful talk, the men of Japan speak of
Corea as belonging to themselves, and
her merchants and artisans assume that
their shops and factories will, in fu-
ture, be erected there. Thanks to the
possession of Liu-kiu, and the conquest
of Formosa and the Pescadores, which
form a kind of line of circumvallation,
the Japanese do really command, in a
military sense, the seas of Eastern
China; and the development of Corca,
with its ten millions of inhabitants,
would but afford a new opening for the
yearly emigration, which is already con-
siderable, and must needs become larger
and larger, since the annual increase in
the inhabitants of that confined archi-
pelago amounts to more than three hun-
dred thousand souls. The treaty lately
concluded with Russia appears to give
entire satisfaction in the empire of the
Rising Sun; for while stipulating that
the sovereign of Corea shall continue to
reign independently under the double
protection of the two high contracting
powers, the compact recognizes, and by
so doing encourages, the commercial and
industrial preeminence of Japan in Corea.
That the colonists and speculators of Ja-
pan are in actual possession of the penin-
sula is proved by the tenor of this dip-
lomatic agreement; and whatever may
be the remote consequences of this move
of theirs, even though it should entail a
terrible convulsion at some future day,
they will none the less have been the
leading spirits, for a time, in a gzeat po-
litical work.

Corean condominium, has been deter-
mined by the conduct of Great Britain,
which does not seem, in the present in-
stance, to have been particularly astute.
England has never yet played, in the
northern seas of the Far East, that lead-
ing part which she believes to be her
due. In 1885, for example, after she
had seized Port Hamilton in the Nan-
hou group, she proceeded to evacuate it,
at the invitation of Russia, who under-
took, on her part, never, upon any pre-
text, to occupy any Corean port. But
we all know what such promises are
worth. Hardly two lustres have elapsed
since then, and Russia is already signing,
with another rival, a compact implying
very different views. England, mean-
while, startled by the transformation
scene at Kiao-chau and the capture of
Manchuria by the Russians, proceeded
to demand her slice of the cake, and
fixed her eyes upon Wei-hai-wei, under
peril of wounding the sensibilities of the
Japanese, who were still holding that
witness to their triumph over China, and
had hoped, no doubt, to keep it, in case
the court of Peking failed to pay the
promised indemnity.
	It was no light thing thus to mortify
a people who hold their grudges with pe-
culiar tenacity, and to throw them back
upon a closer alliance with Russia,  the
enemy whom England has to encoun-
ter at all points, from Constantinople to
Peshawur, and from Peshawur to Han-
kau. From a political point of view,
this risk might have been justified by
conquests of exceptional value; but Wei-
hai-wei is absolutely of no value to the
English, save as a station for docks and
arsenals, and for keeping a close watch
over the great neighboring market of
Chi-fu. As a strategic point, at the en-
trance to the Gulf of Pechili, Wei-hai-
wei is very inferior to Port Arthur,
which actually commands the inner wa-
ters; nor can it compare with the Ger-
man Kiao-chau, of which the appurte-
nances and dependencies extend into the
very heart of the Chinese territory, and
which is thus in a position to neutralize
any movement from the interior. The
very costly military station of Wei-hai-
wei in no way augments the real strength
of England, whose commercial interests
all centre in the south, on the shores of
the Flower of the Midland, and in the
valleys of Sikiang and of the Yang-tse.
	An unexpected event, almost grotesque
in the sharp contrast which it affords to
the usual slow phases of Oriental dip-
lomacy, has improved, though quite in-
directly, Great Britains position with
regard to Russia. The destruction of
the Spanish fleet in the bay of Manila,
with its inevitable consequences,  that
is to say, the prolonged, and it may
be permanent intervention of North
American influence among the islands
of Indonesia,  will certainly react, in
an increase of prestige, upon that na-
tion, which is most closely bound to the
American republic by language, sympa-
thy, and common traditions. There can
be no question that in the popular ima-
gination, of the Orientals especially, the
Americans and the English, however
different in many ways, even in the ad-
mixture of ethnic elements, are looked
upon as sister nations; or rather, as one
and the same nation under different ad-
ministrations. Experience shows that,
at grave crises, the two English-speak-
ing peoples have outbursts of sympa-
thetic feeling,  a sort of gush of mutual
affection, not to say common patriot-
ism, which is powerful enough at times
to manifest itself in semi-official acts.
A Greater Britain, very much greater
even than that of which the politicians
were talking but yesterday, is looming
in the near future. It is a fact of the
first importance, showing as it does
how the very shrinkage of the earth,
brought about by the progress of science
and by increased facilities of communi-
cation, has the effect Qf enlarging mens
minds and of broadening every question.
Contemporaneous history is far outstep</PB>

ping the narrow conceptions of the Mon-
roe Doctrine. That doctrine was rea-
sonable in its day, and sufficed for a
time for the political guidance of Amer-
ica; but it has been shattered once for
all by its own indirect extension,  the
very first act in the war of Cuban in-
dependence having taken place at the
Philippines, or precisely at the antipo-
des of the Pearl of the Antilles. The
worlds equilibrium is destroyed at once,
and Spain, France, the German Em-
pire, Great Britain, Japan, China, Europe
and Asia, are agitated alike. America
for the Americans! How trivial the
formula in comparison with that other,
equally applicable to all races and coun-
tries, A free land for free men! His-
tory is making haste, and precipitating
the consequences of previous events.
	But what is to become of China her-
self, in this squabble of the nations about
her territory? In the first place, it is
quite evident that the four hundred mil-
lions of the children of Han do not
constitute, for Europe, a yellow peril,
in the sense lately given to that term by
certain pessimistic prophets. The Chi-
nese have survived by many centuries
their belligerent age. More civilized
in this respect than the Europeans them-
selves, they do not believe that iron is
good only to make swords of; and if
they are compelled to fall into milItary
step, it will always be against their own
convictions that they engage in wars of
conquest or even of defense. Mongo-
lians and Manchurians will doubtless
serve as recruits in the Russian armies,
but they will never again invade Europe
in independent hordes, as the Huns and
the Mongols did in days of yore.
	The civilized world is no more hemmed
in by barbarians, as it was at the down-
fall of the Roman Empire. It is the
barbaric regions, on the contrary, which
have become rapidly diminishing frag-
ments, melting like icicles in the sun.
	But ought the term yellow peril
to be understood as implying a different

sort of menace, and one much more to
be dreaded than the first, were it ever
to be realized? Will the countries
which have achieved an Aryan civ-
ilization  that is to say, Europe and
the New World  have to encounter
the competition of the Far East in the
labor market, under such conditions of
inferiority that the centre of industrial
and commercial civilization will be re-
moved toward the Flower of the Mid-
land, entailing a widespread material
ruin, of which moral decadence will
be the inevitable result? This fear is
equally chimerical. Doubtless there will
be great alterations in the balance of
power among the different nations of
the earth, no less than in the activity
of their several markets. Doubtless,
brute capital, ever eager to obtain the
most labor for the lowest wage, will
speculate as long as practicable on the
traditional moderation of the Chinese
and Japanese; but in the end there will
assuredly be something like an equaliza-
tion in the rewards of the great indus-
tries. Even now, we are told, the China-
man in New York or Boston knows per-
fectly well how to secure for his labor
the same pay that his white rival gets;
while, at the same time, how many Irish
workmen, Lombard contadini, and Rus-
sian moujiks are painfully striving to
keep soul and body together, at famine
prices,  prices quite as low as those of
which the poorest Japanese complains!
There will be no change in the relations
of labor and capital save this: that they
will henceforth contend upon a broader
stage; that all social questions will be
discussed openly, before the great pub-
lic, with a full understanding on the
part of the opponents that their strug-
gle involves the disinherited in all parts
of the globe. Everything now assumes
an international character; and as the
Americans have set out in the present
war by enlarging the narrow bounds of
the Caribbean Sea so as to take in the
seas of the Far East, so every labor crisis</PB>

hereafter, every strike and lockout, every
lowering or raising of wages, will be pro-
pagated from country to country, as far
as the ends of the earth. What passes
in China or Japan will affect Europe
and America; and the events which take
place among ourselves will make part of
the history of our autochthones.
	Thus, all things lead us back to the
larger human question: the shock of
navies in the Chinese seas; annexations
of territory consummated by this power
or that, to the detriment of the Flower
of the Midland; commercial and indus-
trial societies, founded upon the Euro-
pean model, in lands but lately closed to
the barbarian,  all those facts, in
short, of contemporary life which in their
rapid succession help to confront us with
that supreme problem of bread and
justice for all, which each one of us is
bound to study for himself.

PRINCE KROPOTKIN.

	THE recent visit of Prince Kropotkin
to America has called attention anew to
one of the most remarkable men of this
generation. The career of perhaps no
other man living has been so striking in
its contrasts. An aristocrat by birth, he
deliberately sacrificed great wealth and
high position to become a revolutionist
and a refugee, exchanging the favor of
the Russian court for a prison cell and
perpetual exile. He has won fame in
two directions,  as an explorer and a
scientist, and as the foremost of the
communist Anarchists. From whatever
point of view, his personality and his
work are an interesting study.
	Prince Peter Kropotkin was born in
Moscow, December 9, 1842. His fami-
ly, descended from the house of Rurik,
belongs to the older or Moscow aristo-
cracy, and is of a more ancient stock
than the reigning dynasty of the Roma-
noffs. It used to be said by his intimates
that Kropotkin had a much better claim
to the throne than Alexander II., who
was only a German. Prince Kropot-
kins father, General Alexander Kropot-
kin, held a prominent position in the
military service of the Tsar. He was
essentially a soldier, with the strength
and defects of the military temper. His
ambition for his son was a career in
the army; nothing else seemed to him
worth while. For the life of the civil-
ian he felt a sort of contempt, and the
tastes and accomplishments of the schol-
ar he could not understand. When the
prince wished to take lessons in music,
his father said roughly that all a man
needed to know about music was how
to turn the pages for a lady. Skill
in horsemanship was better than any
amount of knowledge. His mother, who
died while he was very young, was of a
different disposition. She was a highly
educated woman, possessing remarkable
intellectual powers and much personal
beauty. Her character was so lovable
that the serfs of the estate were devoted
to her; her unselfishness, her delicate
consideration for others, won all hearts.
Prince Kropotkiu is his mothers son.
According to the traditions of the family,
he closely resembles his maternal grand-
father and uncles. When his father mar-
ried again, some of the household servants
hinted to the newcomer that she should
treat the children with special care. As
may be imagined, this did not promote
domestic peace. Kropotkin was at this
time about five and a half years of age,
his brother Alexander was a year older,
and another brother, Nicholas, and a sis-
ter, Helen, were older still.</PB></P>

	THE recent visit of Prince Kropotkin
to America has called attention anew to
one of the most remarkable men of this
generation. The career of perhaps no
other man living has been so striking in
its contrasts. An aristocrat by birth, he
deliberately sacrificed great wealth and
high position to become a revolutionist
and a refugee, exchanging the favor of
the Russian court for a prison cell and
perpetual exile. He has won fame in
two directions,  as an explorer and a
scientist, and as the foremost of the
communist Anarchists. From whatever
point of view, his personality and his
work are an interesting study.
	Prince Peter Kropotkin was born in
Moscow, December 9, 1842. His fami-
ly, descended from the house of Rurik,
belongs to the older or Moscow aristo-
cracy, and is of a more ancient stock
than the reigning dynasty of the Roma-
noffs. It used to be said by his intimates
that Kropotkin had a much better claim
to the throne than Alexander II., who
was only a German. Prince Kropot-
kins father, General Alexander Kropot-
kin, held a prominent position in the
military service of the Tsar. He was
essentially a soldier, with the strength
and defects of the military temper. His
ambition for his son was a career in
the army; nothing else seemed to him
worth while. For the life of the civil-
ian he felt a sort of contempt, and the
tastes and accomplishments of the schol-
ar he could not understand. When the
prince wished to take lessons in music,
his father said roughly that all a man
needed to know about music was how
to turn the pages for a lady. Skill
in horsemanship was better than any
amount of knowledge. His mother, who
died while he was very young, was of a
different disposition. She was a highly
educated woman, possessing remarkable
intellectual powers and much personal
beauty. Her character was so lovable
that the serfs of the estate were devoted
to her; her unselfishness, her delicate
consideration for others, won all hearts.
Prince Kropotkiu is his mothers son.
According to the traditions of the family,
he closely resembles his maternal grand-
father and uncles. When his father mar-
ried again, some of the household servants
hinted to the newcomer that she should
treat the children with special care. As
may be imagined, this did not promote
domestic peace. Kropotkin was at this
time about five and a half years of age,
his brother Alexander was a year older,
and another brother, Nicholas, and a sis-
ter, Helen, were older still.</PB>

	At the age of eight the prince was
enrolled in the school of the pages at
St. Petersburg, and at the age of fifteen
he became a pupil in the school, which
was open only to the sons of nobility.
He was a favorite among his comrades
and in the court circle. An honorable
career in the government service was
expected for him by his friends, as a
matter of course. His life would very
likely resemble that of his first cousin,
Prince Dmitri Kropotkin, who was an
aide-de-camp to the Emperor, then gov-
ernor - general of Korao at the age of
thirty, and afterward governor - gener-
al of Kharkoff. During the four years
spent in the school of the pages young
Kropotkin distinguished himself in his
studies, and his distaste for a military
life became pronounced; but he well
knew that his father would not permit
him to follow his natural bent and enter
the university. At this time the early
liberal tendencies of Alexander II. were
in the ascendant, and the spirit of re-
form was in the air. Kropotkin, in sym-
pathy with this spirit, believed implicitly
that the Tsar was determined to do
away with administrative abuses, and
give constitutional freedom to his sub-
jects. The more remote parts of the
empire offered a wide field to any one
who cared to take part in the prosecu-
tion of these reforms. When, therefore,
the time came for him to decide upon his
future, Prince Kropotkin, to the amaze-
ment of his friends and the displeasure
of his father, enrolled himself as a lieu-
tenant in the Cossacks of the Amur,
choosing a service far from brilliant or
attractive. General Kropotkin was only
partially reconciled to this action of his
son when the words of the Emperor to
the young prince were reported to him.
Go, said Alexander. One can be
useful anywhere.
	A congenial task awaited him. Gen-
eral Kukel, governor - general of Trans-
baikalia, a province of Eastern Siberia,
received orders from St. Petersburg to
prepare a report on the prisons of the
province, and the duty was assigned to
Kropotkin, who was an aide to the gov-
ernor. The horrors that this investiga-
tion revealed were appalling. The cruel-
ty and corruption of the prison officials
would have convinced him of the hope-
lessness of reform, had he not had faith
in the Tsar. He still thought that when
the Emperor knew of these abuses they
would cease forever. But this sanguine
expectation was doomed to disappoint-
ment. Alexander II. was now weary
of a liberal policy. General Kukel was
removed from office, his successor was
opposed to any changes for the better,
and the report on the prison system
was pigeonholed, and never heard from
thereafter. A scheme for local govern-
ment which Kropotkin had helped to
formulate was unceremoniously rejected.
Utterly disheartened, he turned away
for the time from further attempting to
lessen the wretchedness about him. Ap-
pointed attach6 for Cossacks affairs to
the governor-general of Eastern Siberia,
he undertook a series of explorations
into the most remote regions of the em-
pire, and even into China. He crossed
North Manchuria from Transbaikalia to
the Amur by way of Mergen, and in
the same year was on board the first
steamboat which made its way up the
Sungari to Girin. On these and other
expeditions he was sometimes shut off
for months from communication with
the civilized world; but he endured
hardships with a cheerful courage which
won for him the enthusiastic admiration
and affection of his rot~gh companions.
He devoted himself, with the trained
powers of the man of science, to the
painstaking study of the natural features
of the regions that he visited. The ac-
counts of these expeditions were pub-
lished subsequently in the proceedings
of the Russian and Siberian Geographi-
cal Society. After five years in Siberia
he returned to St. Petersburg, with an
established reputation as an explorer and</PB>

a scientist, although he was but twenty-
five years of age. He had given him-
self unreservedly to the cause of admin-
istrative reform, and had discovered that
his best efforts had been in vain. He
then turned to science for consolation
and occupation.
	On his arrival at St. Petersburg
Prince Kropotkin was warmly received.
Although the favor of the Tsar toward
him was already waning, he was popu-
lar in the court circle. He was made
a chamberlain to the Tsarina; decora-
tions were bestowed upon him, and he
was made the recipient of many atten-
tions. His brilliant conversation and
charming manners won friends for him
everywhere. Interesting tales were cur-
rent of his daring and chivalrous ex-
ploits in Siberia. All sorts of romantic
adventures were attributed to him. On
account of his conspicuous services to
science, he was elected a member of the
Geographical Society, and later the sec-
retary of the Physical Geography sec-
tion of the society. He was a student
for four years at the University of St.
Petersburg, where he won distinction in
the mathematical department. His f a-
ther disapproved strongly of his course
in entering the university, and empha-
sized his disapproval by withholding
from that time the least contribution to
his support, but there was no formal rup-
ture between father and son. He and
his brother Alexander, who was also a
student, supported themselves by writ-
ing for the press and by teaching. After
completing his university course, Prince
Kropotkin was sent by the Geographical
Society to Finland to investigate cer-
tain geological phenomena. It was his
ambition at this time to be appointed
secretary of the Geographical Society,
a position which would give him conge-
nial occupation and assure him a liveli-
hood. He was offered the coveted ap-
pointment while in Finland, but the
offer came too late; an inward change
made its acceptance impossible. The
condition of the Finnish peasantry was
most pitiable. Abject poverty and hope-
less suffering abounded everywhere. The
sight of this misery made an irresistible
appeal to the heart of the young prince.
What could geology do for the relief of
these poor people? Love for his fellow
men was stronger in him than love for
science, and the stronger love prevailed.
At about this time news came of the
death of General Kropotkin, and his son
became the inheritor of a large fortune
in his own right. He decided to accept
this inheritance, but to use it only for the
good of mankind. The inward command
to devote himself to the cause of human
liberty had grown, until now its sway
over him was absolute and destined to
be permanent.
	But what was to be done? He had
made trial of administrative reform and
found it impossible. He must have
some positive programme, some definite
scheme of social reconstruction. The
Paris Commune of 1871 had an influ-
ence on the revolutionary movement in
Russia and in other countries. To
Kropotkin, the Commune, despite its
overthrow, seemed to demonstrate the
ability of the people to cast off the yoke
of oppression, and to assert their own
sovereignty. In the spring of 1872 he
visited Belgium and Switzerland, and
came into contact with the International
Workingmens Association. It will be
recalled that there were two parties
in this famous revolutionary organiza-
tion, each of which was struggling for
supremacy: the Socialist party, led by
Karl Marx, and the Anarchist party,
led by Bakunin. Kropotkin was at first
inclined toward the Socialists, but soon
found his faith and work with the An-
archists. This was not a case of sudden
conversion,  an aristocrat and a scholar
one day becoming the next day a demo-
crat and a revolutionist. When Kropot-
kin embraced the Anarchist doctrine, he
simply took the final step in a process
which began in his youth. It is not</PB>

difficult to understand why Anarchism
should have attracted him rather than
Socialism. The Russian government was
the embodiment of the principle of cen-
tralized authority; since under this gov-
ernment the people were oppressed, and
reform was impossible, the only effectual
remedy was to sweep away government
altogether. But the Socialists under
Marx proposed to establish the Socialist
r6gime and maintain it through a Social-
ist state; they clung to the principle of
centralization, and carried it to its fur-
thest limit. That programme, as Kropot-
kin regarded it, meant the breaking of
old fetters only to substitute new ones.
	He could now devote himself to a de-
finite propaganda. He returned to St.
Petersburg, and was admitted to mem-
bership in the revolutionary party known
as the Tchaikovsky. He drew up the
plan of organization and the programme
of the party, but he was not at this time,
nor ever in his life, connected with any
conspiracy. Indeed, the revolutionists
had not yet been driven to engage in
the policy of terrorism sometimes called
the propaganda of the deed. It was
a campaign of education upon which
Kropotkin entered. His gift of popular
speech fitted him for effective work of
this kind. Under the assumed name of
Borodin, he began to lecture to working-
men upon the history of the Interna-
tional Association and the principles of
the revolutionary movement. They lis-
tened to him with the greatest interest,
and spread the news of the agitation
among their fellows in the Alexander-
Nevsky district of the city. The only
crime Kropotkin committed was to have
radical convictions regarding the cause
of and the cure for social injustice, and
to utter his convictions freely. The des-
potism, however, with perfect consisten-
cy, recognized free speech as its most
formidable foe. Borodin was, of course,
~ seditious character, and it was not
long before he discovered that the police
were on his track; but he was able to
evade them until the lectures were fin-
ished. He was then about to go into the
country in the disguise of an itinerant
artist, to continue the agitation among
the peasants, when he was pointed out
to a policeman on the street, one day, by
a workingman who had been bribed to
betray him. Borodin at first refused to
disclose his real name, but his landlady
was the innocent means of revealing to
the authorities that their captive was
Prince Kropotkin. His arrest occurred
in March, 1874, when he was thirty-two
years old. He was never tried, but was
imprisoned in the bastile of St. Peters-
burg, the fortress of St. Peter and St.
Paul, where he remained for more than
two years. The news that one of the
most eminent scientific men and best
known noblemen in the empire was a
political prisoner caused a great sensa-
tion. The Tsar himself was profoundly
moved. The most subtle and persistent
persuasions were used by persons of the
highest rank, who visited Kropotkin in
his confinement, to induce him to aban-
don his errors, but without effect. His
cell, which was in a casemate, was badly
lighted, imperfectly ventilated, andnever
free from dampness. The food was al-
most intolerable. Little wonder that he
fell ill, and that his health became per-
zuanently impaired. To the day of his
death, he will never be free from the
terrible effects of that imprisonment.
	In addition to his bodily suffering,
Prince Kropotkin was racked with anx-
iety concerning the fate of his brother
Alexander, who was in Switzerland at
the time of the arrest. On hearing what
had happened, Alexander Kropotkin
hastened home. Knowing that it was
idle to work for the release of his bro-
ther, he strove to secure some mitiga-
tion of the hardships of his situation.
His request that books and writing ma-
terial be given to the prisoner was sec-
onded by the Geographical Society, and
was finally granted. Thus it came about
that a large part of Kropotkins great-</PB>

est scientific work, a treatise on the Gla-
cial Period,  subsequently published
in the proceedings of the Geographi-
cal Society,  was written within prison
walls. Alexander Kropotkin was not
sparing in his denunciation of the gov-
ernment for its treatment of his brother.
A letter which he wrote fell into the
hands of the police. No other incrim-
inating papers were found, and there
was no other evidence against him. Yet
he was arrested, tried, and sentenced to
exile in Siberia. While in prison word
was brought him that one of his children
was dying. He asked permission to go
to the child and bid it a last farewell:
he would promise, as a man of honor, to
come back; they might send with him as
large a guard as they pleased. But his
request was refused. After twelve years
of exile, Alexander Kropotkin sought
the only relief possible to him, and took
his own life.
	The report of his brothers arrest
reached Prince Kropotkin, but all inf or-
mation as to his fate was denied him.
After he had spent more than two years
in the fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul,
his illness became so serious that, most
fortunately, he was transferred to the
military hospital. Forthwith he began
to devise plans for escape. He feigned
the greatest weakness, so as to lessen the
watchfulness of the officers, and he estab-
lished communication by ingenious meth-
ods with friends on the outside. Every
day he was permitted to walk in the
court-yard, and then, if at all, was his
opportunity for escape. At this time of
year the winters supply of wood was
being taken in, and the gate was open.
He worked out with thorough care the
chances of being shot by the sentinel at
the critical instant, and lie concluded
that they were in favor of escape. He
determined by a delicate calculation the
point in the march of the sentinel most
timely for his making the rush to the
gate. Friends without were to have a
carriage in waiting, and the signal was
to be given by sending up a red air-ball.
The appointed day came, but, when too
late to make any change in details, it
was ascertained that a red air-ball could
not be obtained at any toy-shop in the
city. The second attempt was success-
ful. A room was hired in an upper
story of a building overlooking the hos-
pital, and a friend kept watch from the
window. At the right moment he was
to play upon a violin, ceasing when
danger appeared. Once more the time
agreed upon arrived. When circum-
stances seemed most propitious, the pri-
soner dashed for the gate; but he was so
feeble that the sentinel almost overtook
him, and barely missed thrusting him
through with his bayonet. His friends
hurried the fugitive into the carriage,
and he was safe. When the alarm was
sounded in the hospital, the officer in
charge was panic-stricken, and did not
recover self - possession until successful
pursuit was hopeless. Kropotkin was
smuggled out of the country, in the dis-
guise of a military officer. He passed
through Sweden and Norway, crossed
over to Hull, and thence went to Edin-
burgh. His property, of course, had been
confiscated by the government, and he
earned a precarious subsistence in Edin-
burgh and London by writing for Nature
and the Times. Expecting to return to
Russia at some time in the near future,
he concealed his identity, and this gave
rise to an amusing circumstance. He
was asked by the editor of the Times to
write a review of his own book on the
Orography of Eastern Siberia! This di-
lemma forced him to tell his real name;
but the editor promised to keep the se-
cret, and thought it not improper that
the author should review himself.
	One who had endured so much for
his convictions could not easily forget
them. After remaining a short time
in Great Britain, Prince Kropotkin went
to Switzerland, which was the centre of
the revolutionary movement outside of
Russia. There the Russian police began</PB>

a systematic espionage upon his move-
ments, which has not ceased up to the
present time, and this compelled him to
abandon all thought of returning home.
He has not visited his native land since
1876. As an escaped prisoner he is ex-
cluded from the amnesty granted to some
of the other political offenders, and there
is probably no man whom the Russian
government would more gladly get with-
in its power. The following incident
shows the eagerness of the secret police
to seize him. A friend of his, in high
official position in Russia, conveyed to
him the particulars of a plot by which
he was to be kidnapped. Police sent
from Russia into Switzerland in disguise
were to waylay him in some solitary
place, and he was simply to disappear.
The names of persons involved in the
plot and all details were given. Kro.
potkin, on the advice of a friend, placed
in the hands of a prominent representa-
tive of the London Times a full account
of the affair, and then informed the plot-
ters what he had done; stating that if
any harm befell him the Times would
publish the inner history of the matter,
with the names of the persons concerned
in it. That put an end to the plot.
	During the three or four years that
he remained in Switzerland, Kropotkin
carried on a vigorous propaganda of An-
archist ideas by means of lectures, con-
ferences, and writing for the press. He
began at Geneva the publication of a
journal called Le R6volt6, in which he
set forth the evils of the present social
system, and appealed with intense ear-
nestness to all who cared for justice to
abolish these evils by abolishing law and
government. A series of papers enti-
tled Les Paroles dun R6volt6 were pub-
lished in this journal, and afterward
collected and issued in book form. Kro-
potkin was now recognized by Anarchists
every where as their intellectual leader.
March 13, 1881, Alexander II. was
killed by a dynamite bomb. There was
not only no evidence to implicate any
of the Russian refugees in this affair,
but it was impossible, in the nature of
the case, that they should have had any
connection with it. As Stepniak has
shown, no persons outside of Russia could
direct or even have previous knowledge
of Nihilist undertakings. Such terrible
secrets could not be communicated by
post or telegraph; orders could not be
given or received except in person and
on the. ground. Kropotkin believed and
said that the death of the Tsar was an
inevitable result of his reactionary and
oppressive policy, and that in this sense
his fate was deserved. In the panic which
followed this ~vent the Russian govern-
ment remembered Kropotkin, always a
prominent object of suspicion and hatred,
and Switzerland was informed that it
would be very acceptable to Russia if he
were invited to leave the country. The
Swiss authorities could not disregard
such a request, and the prince was com-
pelled to depart. After a brief visit to
England, he returned to the Continent
and took up his abode in France, at
Thonon, near the Swiss border, continu-
ing his propaganda among French work-
ingmen. He advocated, as before, a so-
cial revolution which should sweep away
the organized state, and abolish the right
of private property and all external au-
thority. Do what you like, said Kro-
potkin. Such was his confidence in hu-
man nature that he believed that if the
individual were freed from all restraint,
peace and good will would prevail uni-
versally among men; the Golden Rule
would become the unconscious and natu-
ral law of life. With unwearied energy
he urged the adoption of these ideas,
in public addresses and in print. The
journal which was suppressed at Geneva
was revived at Paris under the name
La R6volte. Again suppressed, it was
once more revived as Les Temps Nou-
veaux, the publication of which is still
continued at Paris. This paper is edit-
ed with much ability, and is the leading
organ of the Anarchists. It is issued</PB>

weekly, with a literary supplement, and
is comparatively moderate in tone.
	During the winter of 1882 labor dis-
orders were rife in the vicinity of Lyons.
Numerous strikes occurred, and the feel-
ing of working people toward the cap-
italist class became intensely bitter.
Revolutionary utterances were freely
indulged in at public meetings, and the
government was unsparingly denounced.
The crisis was reached when dynamite
explosions took place at Montceau-les-
Mines and in a eaf 6 at Lyons. These
disorders, it was affirmed by the au-
thorities, were to be traced to the in-
cendiary teaching of Kropotkin, and in
consequence lie and many others were
arrested. Their trial began at Lyons,
January 8, 1883, and lasted eleven days.
The accused, fifty-two in number, among
whom was Louise Michel, were charged
with affiliation with the International
Association, which aimed at the sus-
pension of labor, the abolition of pro-
perty, the family, country, and religion,
and of being guilty of an attack upon
the public peace. The International
Association, to be sure, had ceased to ex-
ist some years before, but the judgment
declared that the law of 1872 against
the International applied also to the
Lyons Revolutionary Federation, of
which it was really a branch or survival.
It was proved that Prince Kropotkin
was in London at the time of the dy-
namite explosions, and that he had no
connection with the persons responsible
for these explosions. He was convicted,
however, of the charge of reorganizing
the International Association, in spite of
the fact that the chief of the Lyons
police admitted that he did not believe
the International had been reorganized.
The mere trial of the case before the
Cour Correctionnehle was equivalent to
conviction. The fact was, there were
reasons of state, as afterward appeared,
which made the imprisonment of Kro-
potkin desirable, and this was practically
decided upon before the trial. He was
condemned to five years in prison, ten
years of police supervision, five years
deprivation of civil rights, and the pay-
ment of a fine of two thousand francs.
It was significant that all who took part
in the prosecution received Russian de-
corations.
	For the next three years Kropotkin
was again a prisoner, this time in repub-
lican France, at Clairvaux. The gov-
ernor of the prison, perhaps because he
feared that the Anarchists committed to
his care might make reprisals upon him
on their release if they were treated with
severity, was inclined to be lenient to-
ward them. Nevertheless, this second
imprisonment had its peculiar trials.
Princess Kropotkin took lodgings in the
village, and every unusual sound within
the prison inclosure filled her with ter-
ror. When a guard fired at a prisoner
who, in defiance of the regulations, ven-
tured to stand too near the window of
his cell, she was in an agony of appre-
hension lest it was her husband who had
been shot. He passed his time in writ-
ing, reading, and making experiments
in intensive agriculture on a patch of
ground fifty feet square. The privilege
of walking with his wife in the gover-
nors garden was proposed to him, but he
declined the favor because it could not
be shared by his comrades in misfortune.
Meantime, agitation for the release of
Kropotkin never ceased in France and
in England. A petition for his pardon
was signed by every scientific man of
eminence in Great Britain, and by learned
associations almost without number, in-
cluding the Council of the British Mu-
seum. In the public prints his cause
was pleaded earnestly and unceasingly
by able men. Immediately after his
imprisonment, M. Cl6menceau and his
friends organized a movement in his be-
half in the Chamber of Deputies, and
every time the question was agitated
many votes were gained for him. No
rest was given to the government: Kro-
potkin, Kropotkin, was the incessant</PB>

challenge of the opposition. Under all
this pressure he would soon have been
set free, but for the real cause of his
condemnation, the influence of Russia.
After three years, one day when the
question of amnesty to prisoners was
being debated in the Chamber, and the
government was hard pushed, in an un-
guarded moment M. de Freycinet said
that Kropotkin could not be released on
account of a question of diplomacy.
This rash admission was a blunder which
could be remedied only by the immedi-
ate pardon of Kropotkin; for the gov-
ernment could not permit itself to avow
that it kept a man in prison solely to
please Russia. He was therefore liber-
ated by a decree of the President of the
Republic, January 15, 1886. Immedi-
ately the French ambassador at St. Pe-
tersburg was treated with such marked
discourtesy by the Tsar that he gave up
his post and returned to Paris.
	For the past twelve years Prince Kro-
potkin has lived quietly in England with
his wife and child. Although an exile
from his native land, and unable to enter
with safety two, perhaps three other Eu-
ropean countries, with impaired health,
forced to rely upon his own exertions
for the maintenance of his family, held
accountable for deeds he did not com-
mit and could not have prevented, he is
neither an embittered nor an unhappy
man. Even now the Russian govern-
ment keeps watch upon his movements,
and when he came to America followed
him with watchfulness. He lives an al-
most ideal existence in his vine-clad cot-
tage in Kent, respected and loved by a
multitude of friends in high places and
among humble folk. Princess Kropot-
kin is in hearty sympathy with her hus-
bands beliefs, and is a sharer in his
intellectual pursuits.
	The published work of Kropotkin is
of a twofold character, relating in part
to science and in part to social reform.
His earlier scientific works were written
in the Russian language, and published
in the proceedings of the Russian and
Siberian Geographical Society, and have
not been translated into English. Among
these are accounts of his various explora-
tions in Siberia. His chief geographi-
cal work is a Sketch of the Geography
of Eastern Siberia; the most important
of all his scientific writings is his Re-
searches in the Glacial Period, the first
volume of which was written when he
was in prison, and published by the Gee-
graphical Society. His articles on re-
cent science have been for some years
a feature of the Nineteenth Century Re-
view. It is significant not only of his
learning, but also of his character, that
he should have been the first to study
and to write concerning Mutual Aid
among Animals. He has been a fre-
quent contributor to Nature; his name
appears often in the proceedings of the
London Geographical Society; he is the
author of important articles in the Ency-
clopaxlia Britannica, Chamberss Ency-
clop~edia, the Statesmans Year Book, and
Chishoims Gazetteer. In the domain of
science he considers himself primarily a
geographer, like his intimate friend and
fellow Anarchist, Professor Elis6e Re-
clus. His studies in intensive agricul-
ture are exceedingly suggestive and val-
uable, and connect the man of science
and the revolutionist. His contention is
that the cultivation of the soil is in its
infancy; that the earth has practically
unlimited powers of production, which

The citadel, or Kreml, is still the strong-
hold of church and state; and the im-
mense space in front of it, covered with
thousands of shops and warehouses, has
been for centuries a crowded beehive of
commerce,  the heart of a great internal
trade which spreads over the whole sur-
face of the vast empire. The Tversk~lya
and the Smiths Bridge have been for
hundreds of years the chief centres for
the fashionable shops; while the artisans
quarters, the Pluschfkha and the Doro-
goncifiovka, retain the very same features
which characterized their uproarious pop-
ulations in the times of the Moscow Tsars.
Each quarter is a little world in itself;
each has its own physiognomy, and lives
its own separate life. Even the railways
that have made an irruption into the old
capital have grouped apart, in special
centres on the outskirts of the old town,
their stores and machine - works, their
heavily loaded carts and engines.
	However, of all parts of Moscow, none,
perhaps, is more typical than that laby-
rinth of clean, quiet, winding streets and
lanes which lies at the back of the Kreml,
between two great radial streets, the Ar-
b~it and the Prechistenka, and is still
called the Old Equerries Quarter,  the
Shiraya Konyilishennaya. Some fifty
years ago, there lived in this quarter, and
slowly died out, the old Moscow nobility,
whose names were so frequently men-
ti2ned in the pages of Russian history
before the times of Peter I., but who
subsequently disappeared to make room
for the newcomers, the men of all
ranks who were called into service by
the founder of the Russian state.
	Feeling themselves supplanted at the
St. Petersburg court, these old nobles re-
tired either to the Old Equerries Quar-
ter in Moscow, or to their picturesque
estates in the country round about the
capital, and they looked with a sort of
contempt and secret jealousy upon the
motley crowd of families which came
from no one knew where to take pos-
session of the highest functions of the
government, in the new capital on the
banks of the Neva.
	In their younger days, of course, all
of these old nobles had tried their for-
tunes in the service of the state, chiefly
in the army; but for one reason or an-
other they had soon abandoned it, with-
out having risen to high rank. The more
successful ones obtained some quiet, al-
most honorary position in their mother
city,  my father was one of these, 
while most of the others simply retired
from active service. But wheresoever
they might have been shifted, in the
course of their careers, over the wide
surface of Russia, they always somehow
managed to spend their old age in a
house of their own in the Old Equerries
Quarter, under the shadow of the church
where they had been baptized, and where
the last prayers had been pronounced at
the burial of their parents.
	New branches budded from the old
stocks. Some of them achieved more or
less distinction in different parts of Rus-
sia; some owned more luxurious houses
in the new style in other quarters of
Moscow or at St. Petersburg; but the
branch which continued to reside in the
Old Equerries Quarter, somewhere near
to the green, the yellow, the pink, or
the brown church which was endeared
through family associations, was consid-
ered as the true representative of the
family, irrespective of the position it oc-
cupied in the familys genealogic tree.
Its old-fashioned head was treated with
the utmost respect, not devoid of a slight
tinge of irony, even by those younger re-
presentatives of the same stock who had
left their mother city, and looked for a
more brilliant career in the St. Peters-
burg Guard or in the court circles.
	In these quiet streets, far away from the
noise and bustle of the commercial Mos-
cow, all the houses had much the same
appearance. They were mostly built
of wood, with bright green sheet - iron
roofs, the exteriors stuccoed and decorat-
ed with columns and porticoes; all were</PB>

painted in gay colors. In nearly every
ease there was but one story, with seven
or nine big, gay-looking windows facing
the street. A second story was admit-
ted only in the back part of the house,
which looked upon a spacious yard, sur-
rounded by numbers of small buildings,
used as kitchens, stables, cellars, coach-
houses, and as dwellings for the servants.
A wide gate opened upon this yard, and
a brass plate on it usually bore the in-
scription, House of So and So, Lieu-
tenant or Colonel, and Commander, 
very seldom Major - General or any
similarly elevated civil rank. But if a
more luxurious house, embellished by a
gilded iron railing and an iron gate,
stood in one of those streets, the brass
plate on the gate was sure to bear the
name of Commerce Counsel or Hon-
orable Citizen So and So. These were
the intruders, those who came unasked
to settle in this quarter, and were there-
fore ignored by their neighbors.
	No shops were allowed in these se-
lect streets, except that in some small
wooden house, belonging to the parish
church, a tiny grocers or greengrocers
shop might have been found; but then,
the policemans lodge stood on the oppo-
site corner, and in the daytime the po-
liceman himself, armed with a halberd,
would appear at the door to salute with
his inoffensive weapon the officers pass-
ing by, and would retire inside when dusk
came, to employ himself either as a cob-
bler, or in the manufacture of some spe-
cial snuff patronized by the elder male
servants of the neighborhood.
	Life went on quietly and peacefully 
at least for the outsider  in this Mos-
cow Faubourg Saint-Germain. In the
morning nobody was seen in the streets.
About midday the children made their
appearance under the guidance of French
tutors and German nurses, who took them
out for a walk on the snow-covered bou-
levards. Later on in the day the ladies
might be seen in their two-horse sledges,
with a valet standing behind on a small
plank fastened to the back of the vehi-
cle, or ensconced in an old-fashioned car-
riage, immense and high, suspended on
big curved springs and dragged by four
horses, with a postilion in front and two
valets standing behind. In the evening
most of the houses were brightly illumi-
nated, and, the blinds not being drawn
down, the passers - by could admire the
card-players or the waltzers in the sa-
loons. Opinions were not in vogue in
those days, and we were yet far from the
years when in each one of these houses
a struggle began between fathers and
sons,  a struggle that usually ended
either in a family scene or in a noctur-
nal visit of the state police. Fifty years
ago nothing of the sort was thought of;
all was quiet and smooth,  at least on
the surface.
	In this Old Equerries Quarter I was
born in 1842, and here I passed the first
fifteen years of my life. Even when our
father had sold the house in which our
mother died, and bought another, and
when again he sold that house, and we
spent several winters in hired houses,
until he found a third one to his taste,
within a stones - throw of the church
where he had been baptized, we remained
all the time in the Old Equerries Quar-
ter, leaving it only during the summer to
go to our country-seat.

II.

	A high, spacious bedroom, the corner
room of our house, with a wide bed upon
which our mother is lying, our baby chairs
and tables standing close by, and the
neatly served tables covered with sweets
and jellies in pretty glass jars,  a room
into which we children are ushered at a
strange hour,  this is the first half-dis.
tinet reminiscence of my life.
	Our mother was dying of consump-
tion; she was only thirty-five years old.
Before parting with us forever, she had
wished to have us by her side, to caress
us, to feel happy for a moment in our
joys, and she had arranged this little</PB>

treat by the side of her bed which she
could leave no more. I remember her
pale, thin face, her big, dark brown eyes.
She looked at us with love, and invited
us to eat, to climb upon her bed; then
all of a sudden she burst into tears and
began to cough, and we were told to go.
	Some time after, we children  that
is, my brother Alexander and myself 
were transferred from the big house to a
small side house in the court-yard. The
April sun filled the little rooms with its
rays, but our German nurse Madame
Biirman, and Ulidna our Russian nurse,
told us to go to bed. Their faces wet
with tears, they were sewing for us black
shirts bordered with broad white tassels.
We could not sleep: the unknown fright-
ened us, and we listened to their subdued
talk. They said something about our
mother which we could not understand.
We jumped out of our beds, asking,
Where is mamma? Where is mam-
ma?
	Both of them burst into subs, and be-
gan to pat our curly heads, calling us
poor orphans, until Ulhina could hold
out no longer, and said, Your mother is
gone there, to the sky, to the angels.
	How to the sky? Why? our in-
fantile imagination in vain demanded.
	This was in 1846. I was only three
and a half years old, and my brother
S~lsha not yet five. Where our elder
brother and sister, Nicholas and H6l~ne,
had gone I do not know: perhaps they
were already at school. Nicholas was
twelve years old, H~lene was eleven; they
kept together, and we knew them but lit-
tle. So we remained, Alexander and I,
in this little house, in the hands of Ma-
dame B4rman and Uli~ina. The good
old German lady, homeless and absolute-
ly alone in the wide world, took toward
us the place of our mother. She brought
us up as well as she could, buying us from
time to time some simple toys, and over-
feeding us with ginger cakes whenever
another old German, who used to sell
such cakes,  probably as homeless and
solitary as herself,  paid an occasional
visit to our house. We seldom saw our
father, and the next two years passed
without leaving any impression on my
memory.
III.

	Our father was very proud of the ori-
gin of his family, and would point with
solemnity to a piece of parchment which
hung on a wall of his study. It was de-
corated with our arms,  the arms of the
principality of Smolensk covered with
the ermine mantle and the crown of the
Monomachs,  and there was written on
it, and certified by the Heraldry Depart-
ment, that our family originated with a
grandson of Rostisk~v Mstisldvich the
Bold (a name familiar in Russian histo-
ry as that of a Grand Prince of Kieff),
and that our ancestors had been Grand
Princes of Smolensk.
	It cost me three hundred rubles to
obtain that parchment, our father used
to say. Like most people of his genera-
tion, he was not much versed in Russian
history, and valued the parchment more
for its cost than for its historical associa-
tions.
	As a matter of fact, our family is of
very ancient origin indeed; but, like
most descendants of Rurik who may be
regarded as representative of the feudal
period of Russian history, it was driven
into the background when that period
ended, and the Romdnoffs, enthroned at
Moscow, began the work of consolidat-
ing the Russian state. In recent times,
none of the Krop6tkins seem to have had
any special liking for state functions.
Our great-grandfather and grandfather
both retired from the military service
when quite young men, and hastened to
return to their family estates. It must
also be said that of these estates the main
one, Ouro4sovo, situated in the govern-
ment of Ryanln, on a high hill at the
border of fertile prairies, might tempt
any one by the beauty of its shadowy for-
ests, its winding rivers, and its endless
meadows. Our grandfather was only a</PB>

lieutenant when he left the service, and
retired to Ouroilsovo, devoting himself
to his estate, and to the purchase of other
estates in the neighboring provinces.
	Probably our generation would have
done the same; but our grandfather
married a Princess Gagdrin, who be-
longed to a quite different family. Her
brother was well known as a passionate
lover of the stage. He kept a private
theatre of his own, and went so far in
his passion as to marry, to the scandal
of all his relations, a serf,  the genial
actress Semenova, who was one of the
creators of dramatic art in Russia, and
undoubtedly one of its most interesting
figures. To the horror of all Moscow,
she continued to appear on the stage.
	I do not know if our grandmother had
the same artistic and literary tastes as
her brother,  I remember her when she
was already paralyzed and could speak
only in whispers; but it is certain that
in the next generation a leaning toward
literature became a characteristic of our
family. One of the sons of the Princess
Gagdrin was a minor Russian poet, and
issued a book of poems,  a fact which
my father was ashamed of and always
avoided mentioning; and in our own gen-
eration several of our cousins, as well as
my brother and myself, have contribut-
ed more or less to the literature of our
period.
	Our father was a typical officer of the
time of Nicholas I. Not that he was
imbued with a warlike spirit or much in
love with camp life; I doubt whether
be spent a single night of his life at a
bivouac fire, or took part in one bat-
tle. But under Nicholas I. that was of
quite secondary importance. The true
military man of those times was the offi-
cer who was enamored of the military uni-
form, and utterly despised all other sorts
of attire; whose soldiers were trained to
perform almost superhuman tricks with
their legs and rifles (to break the wood
of the rifle into pieces while presenting
arms was one of those famous tricks);
and who could show on parade a row of
soldiers as perfectly aligned and as mo-
tionless as a row of toy-soldiers. Very
good, the Grand Duke Mikhael said
once of a regiment, after having kept it
for one hour presenting arms,  only,
they breathe! To respond to the then
current conception of a military man was
certainly our fathers ideal.
	True, he took part in the Turkish
campaign of 1828; but he managed to
remain all the time on the staff of the
chief commander; and if we children,
taking advantage of a moment when he
was in a particularly good temper, asked
him to tell us something about the war,
he had nothing to tell but of a fierce at-
tack of hundreds of Turkish dogs which
one night assailed him and his faithful
servant, Frol, as they were riding with
dispatches through an abandoned Turk-
ish village. They had to use swords
to extricate themselves from the hungry
beasts. Bands of Turks would assured-
ly have better satisfied our imagination,
but we accepted the dogs as a substi-
tute. When, however, pressed by our
questions, our father told us how he had
won the cross of Saint Anne for gal-
lantry, and the golden sword which he
wore, I must confess we felt really dis-
appointed. His story was decidedly too
prosaic. The officers of the general staff
were lodged in a Turkish village, when
it took fire. In a moment the houses
were enveloped in flames, and in one of
them a child had been left behind. Its
mother uttered despairing cries. There-
upon, Frol, who always accompanied his
master, rushed into the flames and saved
the child. The chief commander, who
saw the act, at once gave father the cross
for gallantry.
	But, father, we exclaimed, it was
Frol who saved the child!
	What of that? replied he, in the
most naive way. Was he not my man?
It is all the same.
	He also took some part in the cam-
paign of 1831, during the Polish Revo</PB>

lution, and in Warsaw he made the ac-
quaintance of, and fell in love with, the
youngest daughter of the commander of
an army corps, General Sulima. The
marriage was celebrated with great pomp,
in the Lazienki palace; the lieutenant-
governor, Count Paski6wich, acting as
nuptial godfather on the bridegrooms
side. But your mother, our father
used to add, brought me no fortune
whatever.
	Surely not. Her father, Nikolai Sc-
menovich Sulima, was not versed in the
art of making a career or a fortune.
He must have had in him too much of
the blood of those Cossacks of the Dnie-
per, who knew how to fight the well-
equipped, warlike Poles or armies of the
Turks, three times more than themselves,
but knew not how to avoid the snares of
the Moscow diplomacy, and, after hav-
ing fought against the Poles in the ter-
rible insurrection of 1648, which was
the beginning of the end for the Polish
republic, lost all their liberties in fall-
ing under the dominion of the Russian
Tsars. One Sulima was captured by the
Poles and tortured to death at Warsaw,
but the other colonels of the same
stock only fought the more fiercely on
that account, and Poland lost Little Rus-
sia. As to our grandfather, he knew
how, with his regiment of cuirassiers
during Napoleon I.s invasion, to cut his
way into a French infantry square bris-
tling with bayonets, and to recover, after
having been left for dead on the battle-
field, with a deep cut in his head; but
he could not become a valet to the fa-
vorite of Alexander I., the omnipotent
Arakch6eff, and was consequently sent
into a sort of honorary exile, first as a
governor-general of West Siberia, and
later of East Siberia. In thcsse times
such a position was considered more lu-
crative than a gold-mine, but our grand-
father returned from Siberia as poor
as he went, and left but modest fortunes
to his three sons and three daughters.
When I went to Siberia, in 1862, I often
heard his name mentioned with respect.
He was simply driven to despair by the
wholesale stealing which went on in those
provinces, and which he had no means
to repress.
	Our mother was undoubtedly a re-
markable woman for the times she lived
in. Many years after her death, I dis-
covered, in a corner of a storeroom of
our country house, a mass of papers cov-
ered with her firm but pretty handwrit-
ing: diaries in which she wrote with
ecstasy of the scenery of Germany, and
spoke of her sorrows and her thirst for
happiness; books which she had filled
with Russian verses that no one was al-
lowed to print then,  among them the
beautiful historical ballads of Ryl6eff, the
poet, whom Nicholas I. hanged in 1826;
other books containing music, French
dramas, verses of Lamartine, and By-
rons poems that she had copied; and a
great number of water-color paintings.
	Tall, slim, adorned with a mass of dark
chestnut hair, with dark brown eyes and
a tiny mouth, she looks quite lifelike in
a portrait in oils that was painted eon
amore by a good artist. Always lively
and often careless, she was fond of dan-
cing, and the peasant women in our vil-
lage would tell us how she would admire
from a balcony their ring-dances,  slow
and full of grace as an old minuet, 
and how finally she would herself join in
them. She had the nature of an artist.
It was at a ball that she caught the cold
that produced the inflammation of the
lungs which brought her to the grave.
	All who knew her loved her. The
servants simply worshiped her memory.
It was in her name that Madame Biir-
man took care of us, and in her name
the Russian nurse bestowed upon us her
love. While combing our hair, or sign-
ing us with the cross in our beds, the lat-
ter would often say, And your mamma
must now look upon you from the skies,
and shed tears on seeing you, poor or-
phans. Her memory passed through
our childhood and cheered it. How of-</PB>

ten, in some dark passage, the hand of
a servant would touch Alexander or me
with a caress; or a peasant woman, on
meeting us in the fields, would ask, Will
you be as good as your mother was? She
took compassion on us. You will, sure-
ly. Us meant, of course, the serfs.
I do not know what would have become
of us if we had not found in our house,
amidst the serf servants, that atmosphere
of love which children must have around
them. We were her children, we bore
likeness to her, and they lavished their
care upon us, sometimes in a touching
form, as will be seen later on.
	Men passionately desire to live after
death, but they often pass away without
noticing the fact that the memory of a
really good person always lives. It is
impressed upon the next generation, and
is transmitted again to the children. Is
not that an immortality worth striving
for?
V.

	Two years after the death of our mo-
ther our father married again. He had
already east his eyes upon a nice-looking
young person, this time belonging to a
wealthy family, when the fates decided
another way. One morning, while he was
still in his dressing-gown, the servants
rushed madly into his room, announcing
the arrival of General Timof6eff, the
commander of the sixth army corps, to
which our father belonged. This favor-
ite of Nicholas I. was a terrible man.
He would order a soldier to be flogged
almost to death for a mistake made dur-
ing a parade, or he would degrade an
officer and send him as a private to Si-
beria because he had met him in the
street with the hooks of his high, stiff
collar unfastened. With Nicholas Gen-
eral Timof&#38; ffs word was all-powerful.
	The general, who had never before
been in our house, came to propose to
our father to marry his wifes aiece,
Mademoiselle Elisabeth Karandin6, one
of several daughters of an admiral of
the Black Sea fleet,  a young lady with
a classical Greek profile, said to have
been very beautiful. Father accepted,
and his second wedding, like the first,
was solemnized with great pomp.
	You young people understand no-
thing of this kind of thing, he said in
conclusion, after having told me the
story more than once, with a very fine
humor which I will not attempt to re-
produce. Bat do you know what it
meant at that time,  the commander of
an army corps? Above all, that one-
eyed devil, as we used to call him, com-
ing himself to propose? Of course she
had no dowry; only a big trunk filled
with their ladies rags, and that Martha,
her one serf, dark as a gypsy, sitting
upon it.
	I have no recollection whatever of this
event. I only remember a big drawing-
room in a richly furnished house, and in
that room a young lady, attractive, but
with a rather too sharp southern look,
gamboling with us, and saying, You see
what a jolly mamma you will have; to
which S~sha and I, sulkily looking at
her, replied, Our mamma has flown
away to the sky. We regarded so much
liveliness with suspicion.
	Winter came, and a new life began for
us. Our house was sold, and another was
bought and furnished completely anew.
All that could convey a reminiscence of
our mother disappeared,  her portraits,
her paintings, her embroideries. In vain
Madame Biirman implored to be retained
in our house, and promised to devote her-
self to the baby our stepmother was ex-
pecting as to her own child: she was sent
away. Nothing of the Sulfmas in my
house, she was told. All connection
with our uncles and aunts and our grand-
mother were broken. Ulhfna was mar-
ried to Frol, who became a major-domo,
while she was made housekeeper; and
for our education a richly paid French
tutor, M. Poulain, and a miserably paid
Russian student, N. P. Smirn6ff, were
engaged.
	Many of the sons of the Moscow nobles</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00359" SEQ="0359" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="353">	The Autobiography of a Revolutionist.	353

were educated at that time by French-
men, who represented the d6bris of Na-
poleons Grande Arm6e. M. Poulain
was one of them. He had just finished
the education of the youngest son of the
novelist Zag6skin, and his pupil, Serge,
enjoyed in the Old Equerries Quarter
the reputation of being so well brought
up that our father did not hesitate to
engage M. Poulain for the considerable
sum of six hundred rubles a year.
	MI. Poulain brought with him his set-
ter Tr&#38; or, his coffee-pot Napol6on, and
his French textbooks, and he began to
rule over us and the serf Matv~i who
was attached to our service.
	His plan of education was very sim-
ple. After having awakened us he at-
tended to his coffee, which lie used to
take in his room. While we were pre-
paring the morning lessons he made his
toilet with minute care: he shampooed
his gray hair so as to conceal his growing
baldness, put on his tail-coat, sprinkled
and washed himself with ean-de-cologne,
and then escorted us downstairs to say
good-morning to our parents. We used
to find our father and stepmother eating
their breakfast, and on approaching them
we recited in the most official way, Bon-
jour, mon cher papa, and Bonjour, ma
ch~re maman, and kissed their hands.
M.	Poulain made a most complicated
and elegant obeisance in pronouncing the
words, Bonjour, monsieur le prince,
and Bonjour, madame la princesse,
after which the procession immediately
withdrew and retired upstairs. This cer-
emony was repeated every morning.
	Then our work began. NI. Poulain
changed his tail-coat for a dressing-gown,
covered his head with a leather cap, and
dropping into an easy-chair said, Recite
the lesson.
	We recited it by heart, froni one
mark which was made in the book with
the nail to the next mark. NI. Poulain
had brought with him the grammar of
Nod and Chapsal, memorable to more
than one generation of Russian boys and
	VOL. LXXXII.  NO. 491.	23
girls; a book of French dialogues; a his-
tory of the world, in one volume; and a
universal geography, also in one volume.
We had to commit to memory the gram-
mar, the dialogues, the history, and the
geography.
	The grammar, with its well-known sen-
tences, What is grammar? The
art of speaking and writing correctly,
went all right. But the history book,
unfortunately, had a preface, which con-
tained an enumeration of all the advan-
tages which can be derived from a know-
ledge of history. Things went on smooth-
ly enough with the first sentences. We
recited: The prince finds in it mag-
nanimous examples for governing his sub-
jects; the military commander learns
from it the noble art of warfare. But
the moment we came to law all went
wrong. The jurisconsult meets in it
 but what the learned lawyer meets in
history we never came to know. That
terrible word jurisconsult spoiled all
the game. As soon as we reached it we
stopped.
	On your knees, gros pouff! ex-
claimed Poulain. (That was for me.)
On your knees, grand dada! (That
was for my brother.) And there we
knelt, shedding tears and vainly endea-
voring to learn all about the jurisconsult.
	It cost us many pains, that preface!
We were already learning all about the
Romans, and used to put our sticks in
Ulidnas scales when she was weighing
rice, just like Brennus; we jumped
from our table and other precipices for
the salvation of our country, in imitation
of Curtius; but NI. Poulain would still
from time to time return to the preface,
and again put us on our knees for that
very same jurisconsult. Was it not there-
fore to be expected that later on both my
brother and I should entertain an undis-
guised contempt for jurisprudence?
	I do not know what would have hap-
pened with geography if Poulains book
had had a preface. But happily the first
twenty pages of the book had been torn</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00360" SEQ="0360" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="354">354	The Autobiography

away (Serge Zag6skin, I suppose, ren-
dered us that notable service), and so
our lessons commenced with the twenty-
first page, which began, of the rivers
which water France.
	It must be confessed that things did
not always end with kneeling. There
was in the class-room a birch rod, and
Poulain resorted to it when there was
no hope of progress with the preface or
with some dialogue on virtue and pro-
priety; but one day sister H~l~ne, who
by this time had left the Catherine Insti-
tut des Demoiselles, and now occupied a
room underneath ours, hearing our cries,
rushed, all in tears, into our fathers
study, and bitterly reproached him with
having handed us over to our stepmo-
ther, who had abandoned us to a re-
tired French drummer. Of course,
she cried, there is no one to take their
part, but I cannot see my brothers being
treated in this way by a drummer!
	Taken thus unprepared, our father
could not make a stand. He began to
scold ll~lene, but ended by approving
her devotion to her brothers. There-
after the birch rod was reserved for
teaching the rules of propriety to the
setter Tr&#38; or.
	No sooner had M. Poulain discharged
himself of his heavy educational duties
than he became quite another man,  a
lively comrade instead of a gruesome
teacher. After lunch he took us out for
a walk, and there was no end to his
tales: we chattered like birds. Though
we never went with him beyond the first
pages of syntax, we soon learned, never-
theless, to speak correctly; we used
to think in French; and when he had
dictated to us half through a book of
mythology, correcting our faults by the
book, without ever trying to explain to
us why a word must be written in a par-
ticular way, we had learned to write
correctly.
	After dinner we had our lesson with
the Russian teacher, a student of the
faculty of law in the Moscow Univer
of a Revolutionist.

sity. He taught us all Russian sub-
jects,  grammar, arithmetic, history,
and so on. But in those years serious
teaching had not yet begun. In the mean-
time he dictated to us every day a pag~
of history, and in that practical way we
quickly learned to write Russian quite
correctly.
	Our best time was on Sundays, when
all the family, with the exception of us
children, went to dinner at Madame la
G6n~rale Timof~effs. It would also
happen occasionally that both M. Poulain
and N. P. Smirn6ff would be allowed to
leave the house, and when this occurred
we were placed under the care of Uli-
dna. After a hurriedly eaten dinner we
hastened to the great hall, to which the
younger housemaids soon repaired. All
sorts of games were started,blind man,
vulture and chickens, and so on; and
then, all of a sudden, Tikhon, the Jack-
of-all-trades, would appear with a violin.
Dancing began; not that measured and
tiresome dancing, under the direction of
a French dancing-master on india-rub-
ber legs, which made part of our edu-
cation, but free dancing which was not
a lesson, and in which a score of cou-
ples turned round any way; and this was
only preparatory to the still more ani-
mated and rather wild Cossack dance.
Tikhon would then hand the violin to
one of the older men, and would begin
to perform with his legs such wonderful
feats that the doors leading to the hall
would soon be filled by the cooks and
even the coachmen, who came to see the
dance so dear to the Russian heart.
	About nine oclock the big carriage was
sent to fetch the family home. Tikhon,
brush in hand, crawled on the floor, to
make it shine with its virgin glance, and
perfect order was restored in the house.
And if, next morning, we two had been
submitted to the most severe cross - ex-
amination, not a word would have been
spoken of the previous evenings amuse-
ments. We never would have betrayed
any one of the servants, nor would they</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00361" SEQ="0361" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="355">	The Autobiography of a Revolutionist.	355

have betrayed us. One Sunday, my bro-
ther and I, playing alone in the wide hall,
ran against a bracket which supported
a costly lamp. The lamp was broken to
pieces. Immediately a council was held
by the servants. No one scolded us;
but it was decided that early next morn-
ing Tikhon should slip out of the house,
at his risk and peril, and run to the
Smiths Bridge in order to buy another
lamp of the same pattern. It cost fifteen
rubles,  an enormous sum for them;
but it was done, and we never heard a
word of reproach about it.
	When I think of it now, and all these
scenes revive in my memory, I notice
that we never heard coarse language in
any of the games, nor saw in the dances
anything like the kind of dancing which
children are now taken to admire in the
theatres. In the servants house, among
themselves, they assuredly used coarse
expressions; but we were children,  her
children,  and that protected us from
anything of the sort.
	In those days children were not bewil-
dered by a profusion of toys, as they are
now. We had almost none, and were
thus compelled to rely upon our own in-
ventiveness. Besides, we both had early
acquired a taste for the theatre. The in-
ferior carnival theatres, with the thiev-
ing and fighting shows, seem to have pro-
duced no lasting impression upon us: we
ourselves played enough at robbers and
soldiers. But the great star of the ballet,
Fanny Elssler, came to Moscow, and we
saw her. When father took a box in the
theatre, he always secured one of the best,
and paid for it well; but then he insisted
that all the members of the family should
enjoy it to its full value. Small though
I was at that time, Fanny Elssler left
upon me the impression of a being so
full of grace, so light, and so artistic in
all her movements that ever since I have
been unable to feel the slig~itest interest
in a dance which belongs more to the
domain of gymnastics than to the domain
of art.
	Of course, the ballet that we saw 
Gitana, the Spanish Gypsy  had to be
repeated at home; its substance, not the
dances. We had a ready-made stage, as
the doorway which led from our bedroom
into the class-room had a curtain instead
of a door. A few chairs put in a half-
circle in front of the curtain, with an
easy-chair for M. Poulain, became the
hall and the imperial lodge, an.d an au-
dience could easily be mustered with the
Russian teacher, Ulittna, and a couple of
maids from the servants rooms.
	Two scenes of the ballet had to be re-
presented by some means or other: the
one where the little Gitana is brought
by the gypsies into their camp in a wheel-
barrow, and that in which Gitana makes
her first appearance on the stage, descend-
ing from a hill and crossing a bridge
over a brook which reflects her image.
The audience burst into frantic applause
at this point, and the cheers were evi-
dently called forth  so we thought, at
least  by the reflection in the brook.
	We found our Gitana in one of the
youngest girls in the maid servants room.
Her rather shabby blue cotton dress was
no obstacle to personifying Fanny Elss-
1cr. An overturned chair, pushed along
by its legs, head downwards, was an ac-
ceptable substitute for the wheelbarrow.
But the brook! Two chairs and the
long ironing-board of Andrei, the tailor,
made the bridge, and a piece of blue cot-
ton made the brook. The image in the
brook, however, would not appear full
size, do what we might with M. Poulains
little shaving-glass. After many unsuc-
cessful endeavors we had to give it up,
but we bribed Ulidna to behave as if she
saw the image, and to applaud loudly at
this passage, so that finally we began to
believe that perhaps something of it could
be seen.
	Racines Phbdre, or at least the last
act of it, also went off nicely; that is,
Sdsha recited the melodious verses beau-
tifully, 
A peine nous sortions des portes de Tr~z~ne ;</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00362" SEQ="0362" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="356">	356	The Autobiography of a Revolutionist.

and I sat absolutely motionless and un-
concerned during the whole length of
the tragic monologue intended to apprise
me of the death of my son, down to the
place where, according to the book, I had
to exclaim, 0, dieux!
	But whatsoever we might impersonate,
all our performances invariably ended
with hell. All candles save one were
put out, and this one was placed behind
a transparent paper to imitate flames,
while my brother and I, concealed from
view, howled in the most appalling way
as the condemned. Uli~na, who did not
like to have any allusion to the evil one
made at bedtime, looked horrified; but
I ask myself now whether this extreme-
ly concrete representation of hell, with
a candle and a sheet of paper, did not
contribute to free us both at an early
age from the fear of eternal fire as it is
figured in Russian churches. Our con-
ception of it was too realistic to resist
skepticism.
	I must have been very much of a child
when I saw the great Moscow actors,
Sch6pkin, Sad6vskiy, and Shiimski, in
Gogols Revisor and another comedy;
still, I remember not only the salient
scenes of the two plays, but even the
figures and expressions of these great
actors of the realistic school which is now
so admirably represented by Duse. I re-
membered them so well that when, at St.
Petersburg, I saw the same plays given
by actors belonging to the French de-
clamatory school, I found no pleasure in
their acting, always comparing theni with
Scb6pkin and Sad6vskiy, by whom my
taste in dramatic art was settled.
	This makes me think that parents who
wish to develop artistic taste in their
children ought to take them occasionally
to really well-acted, good plays, instead
of feeding them on a profusion of so-
called childrens pantomimes.~~

-V.

	When I was in my eighth year, the
next step in my career was taken, in a
quite unforeseen way. I do not know
exactly on what occasion it happened, but
probably it was on the twenty-fifth anni-
versary of Nicholas I. s reign, when great
festivities were arranged for at Moscow.
The imperial family were coming to the
old capital, and the Moscow nobility in-
tended to celebrate this event by a fan-
cy-dress ball, in which children were to
play an important part. It was agreed
that the whole motley crowd of nation-
alities of which the population of the
Russian Empire is composed should be
represented at this ball to greet the mon-
arch. Great preparations went on in our
house, as well as in all the houses of our
neighborhood. Some sort of remarkable
Russian costume was made for our step-
mother. Our father, being a military
man, had to appear, of course, in his uni-
form; but those of our relatives who were
not in the military service were as busy
with their Russian, Greek, Caucasian, aiid
Mongolian costumes as the ladies them-
selves. When the Moscow nobility gives
a ball to the imperial family, it must be
something extraordinary. As for my
brother Alexander and myself, we were
considered too young to take part in so
important a ceremonial.
	And yet, after all, I did take part in
it. Our mother was a warm friend of
Madame Nazimoff, the wife of the offi-
cer who was governor-general of Wilno
during the Polish insurrection of 1863.
Madame Nazimoff, who was a very beau-
tiful woman, was expected to assist at
the ball with her child, about ten years
old, and to wear some wonderfully beau-
tiful costume of a Persian princess; a
costume of a young Persian prince, ex-
ceedingly rich, with a belt covered with
jewels, was made ready for her son. But
the boy fell ill just before the ball, and
Madame Nazimoff thought that one of
the children of her most intimate friend
would be the best substitute for her own
child. Alexander and I were taken to
her house to try on the costume. It
proved to be too short for Alexander, who
p</PB>

was much taller than I, but it fitted me
perfectly well, and therefore it was de-
cided that I should impersonate the Per-
sian prince.
	The immense hall of the house of the
Moscow nobility was crowded. Each of
the children received a standard bearing
at its top the arms of one of the sixty
provinces of the Russian Empire. I had
an eagle floating over a blue sea, which
represented, as I learned later on, the
arms of the government of Astrakhan, on
the Caspian Sea. We were then ranged
at the back of the great hall, and slowly
marched in two rows toward the raised
platform upon which the Emperor and
his family stood. As we reached it we
marched right and left, and thus stood
aligned in one row before the platform.
At a given signal all standards were
lowered before the Emperor. The apo-
theosis of autocracy was made most im-
pressive: Nicholas was enchanted. All
provinces of the empire worshiped the
supreme ruler. Then we children slowly
retired to the rear of the hall.
	But here some confusion occurred.
Chamberlains in their gold-embroidei~ed
garments were running about, and I was
taken out of the ranks; my uncle, Prince
Gagdrin, dressed as a Tungus (I was
dizzy with admiration of his fine leather
coat, his bow, and his quiver full of ar-
rows), lifted me up in his arms, and
planted me on the imperial platform.
	Whether it was because I was the
tiniest in the row of boys, or that my
round face, framed in curls, looked fun-
ny under the high Astrakhan fur bon-
net I wore, I know not, but Nicholas
wanted to have me on the platform; and
there I stood amidst generals and ladies
looking down upon me with curiosity. I
was told later on that the Emperor, who
was always fond of barrack jokes, took
me by the arm, and, leading me to Marie
Alexdndrovna (the wife of the heir to
the throne), who was then expecting her
third child, said in his military way,
That is the sort of boy you must bring
me,  a joke which made her blush
deeply. I well remember, at any rate,
Nicholas asking me whether I would have
sweets; but I replied that I should like
to have some of those tiny biscuits which
were served with tea (we were never over-
fed at home), and he called a waiter and
emptied a full tray into my tall bonnet.
I will take them to Sdsha, I said to
him.
	However, the soldier-like brother of
Nicholas, Mlkhael, who had the reputa-
tion of being a wit, managed to make
rue cry. When you are a good boy,
he said, they make you so, and he
passed his big hand over my face down-
wards; but when you are naughty, they
make you so, and he passed the hand
upwards, rubbing my nose, which already
had a marked tendency toward grow-
ing in that direction. Tears, which I
vainly tried to stop, came into my eyes.
The ladies at once took my part, and
the good - hearted Marie Alexr~ndrovna
placed me under her protection. She
set me by her side, in a high velvet chair
with a gilded back, and our people told
me afterward that I very soon put my
head in her lap and went to sleep. She
did not leave her chair during the whole
time the ball was going on.
	I remember also that, as we were wait-
ing in the entrance-hall for our carriage,
our relatives petted and kissed me, say-
ing, P6tya, you have been made a
page; but I answered, I am not a
page. I will go home, and was very
anxious about my bonnet which con-
tained the pretty little biscuits that I was
taking home for S~sha.
	I do not know whether Sdsha got many
of those biscuits, but I recollect how
warmly he embraced me when he was
told about my anxiety concerning the
bonnet.
	To be inscribed as a candidate for the
corps of pages was then a great favor,
which Nicholas seldom bestowed on the
Moscow nobility. My father was delight-
ed, and already dreamed of a brilliant</PB>

court career for his son; and my step-
mother, every time she told the story,
never failed to add, It is all because I
gave him my blessing before he went to
the ball.
	Madame Nazfmoff was delighted, too,
and insisted upon having her portrait
painted in the costume in which she
looked so beautiful, with me standing at
her side.

	My brother Alexande9s fate, also,
was settled not long after this ball. The
jubilee of the Izmiylovsk regiment, to
which my father had belonged in his
youth, was celebrated about this time at
St. Petersburg. One night, while all the
household was plunged in deep sleep, a
three-horse carriage, ringing with the
bells attached to the harnesses, stopped
at our gate. A man jumped out of it,
loudly shouting, Open! An ordinance
from his Majesty the Emperor.
	One can easily imagine the terror
which this nocturnal visit spread in our
house. My father, trembling, went down
to his study. Court-martial, degrada-
tion as a soldier, were words which rang
then in the ears of every military man;
it was a terrible epoch. But Nicholas
simply wanted to have the names of the
sons of all the officers who had once be-
longed to the regiment, in order to send
the boys to military schools, if that had
not yet been done. A special messenger
had been dispatched for that purpose
from St. Petersburg to Moscow, and now
he called day and night at the houses of
the ex-Izmf~ylovsk officers.
	With a shaking hand my father wrote
that his eldest son, Nicholas, was already
in the first corps of cadets at Moscow;
that his youngest son, Peter, was a can-
didate for the corps of pages; and that
there remained only his second son, Alex-
ander, who had not yet entered the mil-
itary career. A few weeks later came
a paper informing father of the mon-
archs favor. Alexander was ordered
to enter a corps of cadets in Orel, a small
provincial town. It made my father a
deal of trouble, and cost a large sum of
money, to get Alexander sent to a corps
of cadets at Moscow. This new fa-
vor was obtained only in consideration
of the fact that our elder brother was in
that corps.
	And thus, owing to the will of Nicho-
las I., we had both to receive a military
education, though, before we were many
years older, we simply hated the military
career for its absurdity. But Nicholas
was watchful that none of the sons of the
nobility should embrace any other profes-
sion than the military one, unless they
were of infirm health; and so we had all
three to be officers, to the great satisfaction
of my father.
V..

	Wealth was measured in those times
by the number of souls which a land-
ed proprietor owned. So many souls
meant so many male serfs: women did
not count. My father, who owned near-
ly twelve hundred souls, in three differ-
ent provinces, and who had, in addition
to his peasants holdings, large tracts of
land which were cultivated by these pea-
sants, was accounted a rich man. He
lived up to his reputation, which meant
that his house was open to any number
of visitors, and that he kept a very large
household.
	We were a family of eight, occasion-
ally of ten or twelve; but fifty servants
at Moscow, and half as many more in
the country, were considered not one
too many. Four coachmen to attend a
dozen horses, three cooks for the mas-
ters and two more for the servants, a
dozen men to wait upon us at dinner-
time (one man, plate in hand, standing
behind each person seated at the table),
and girls innumerable in the maid ser-
vants room,  how could any one do
with less than this?
	Besides, the ambition of every landed
proprietor was that everything required
for his household should be made at
home, by his own men.</PB>

	How nicely your piano is always
tuned! I suppose Herr Schimmel must
be your tuner? perhaps a visitor would
remark.
	To be able to answer, I have my
own piano-tuner, was in those times the
correct thing.
	What beautiful pastry! the guests
would exclaim, when a work of art, com-
posed of ices and pastry, appeared to-
ward the end of the dinner. Confess,
prince, that it comes from Treinbl6
(the fashionable pastry-cook).
	It is made by my own confectioner,
a pupil of Trembh~, whom I have allowed
to show what he can do, was the reply,
which elicited general admiration.
	To have embroideries, harnesses, fur-
niture, in fact, everything,  made by
ones own men was the ideal of the rich
and respected landed proprietor. As
soon as the children of the servants at-
tained the age of ten, they were sent
as apprentices to the fashionable shops,
where they were obliged to spend five or
seven years chiefly in sweeping, in re-
ceiving an incredible number of thrash-
ings, and in running about town on er-
rands of all sorts. I must own that few
of them became masters of their respec-
tive arts. The tailors and the shoemak-
ers were found only skillful enough to
make clothes or shoes for the servants,
and when a really good pastry was re-
quired for a dinner-party it was ordered
at Trembl6s, while our own confectioner
was beating the drum in the music band.
	That band was another of my fathers
ambitions, and almost every one of his
male servants, in addition to other ac-
complishments, was a bass-viol or a clari-
net in the band. Makar, the piano-tuner,
alias under - butler, was also a flutist;
Andrei, the tailor, played the French
horn; the confectioner was first put to
beat the drum, but he misused his in-
strument to such a deafening degree that
a tremendous trumpet was bought for
him, in the hope that his lungs would
not have the power to make the same
noise as his hands; wben, however, this
last hope had to be abandoned, he was
sent to be a soldier. As to spotted Tik-
hon, in addition to his numerous func-
tions in the household as lamp-cleaner,
floor-polisher, and footman, he rendered
himself useful in the band,  to-day as a
trombone, to-morrow as a bassoon, and
occasionally as second violin.
	The two first violins were the only ex-
ceptions to the rule: they were vio-
lins, and nothing else. My father had
bought them, with their large families,
for a handsome sum of money, from his
sisters (he never bought serfs from nor
sold them to strangers). In the even-
ings when he was not at his club, or when
there was a dinner or an evening party
at our house, the band of twelve to fif-
teen musicians was summoned. They
played very nicely, and were in great de-
mand for dancing-parties in the neigh-
borhood; still more when we were in the
country. This was, of course, a constant
source of gratification to my father, whose
permission had to be asked to get the as-
sistance of his band.
	Nothing, indeed, gave him more plea-
sure than to be asked for help, either
in the way mentioned or in any other:
for instance, to obtain free education for
a boy, or to save somebody from a pun-
ishment inflicted upon him by a law
court. Although he was liable to fall
into fits of rage, he was undoubtedly
possessed of a natural instinct toward
leniency, and when his patronage was
asked for he would write scores of letters
in all possible directions, to all sorts of
persons of high standing, in favor of his
prot6g6. At such times, his mail, which
was always heavy, would be swollen by
half a dozen special letters, written in
a most original, semi-official, and semi-
humorous style; each of them sealed, of
course, with his arms, in a big square
envelope, which rattled like a baby-rattle
on account of the quantity of sand it con-
tained,  the use of blotting-paper being
then unknown. The more difficult the</PB>

case, the more energy he would display,
until he secured the favor he asked for
his prot~g~, whom in many cases he
never saw.
	My father liked to have plenty of
guests in his house. Our dinner-hour
was four, and at seven the family ga-
thered round the samovctr (tea-urn) for
tea. Every one belonging to our circle
could drop in at that hour, and from the
time my sister H~li~ne was again with us
there was no lack of visitors, old and
young, who took advantage of the privi-
lege. When the windows facing the
street showed bright light inside, that
was enough to let people know that the
family was at home and friends would
be welcome.
	Nearly every night we had visitors.
The green tables were opened in the hail
for the card-players, while the ladies and
the young people stayed in the reception-
room or around H~l~nes piano. When
the ladies had gone, card - playing con-
tinued sometimes till the small hours of
the morning, and considerable sums of
money changed hands among the play-
ers. Father invariably lost. But the
real danger for him was not at home: it
was at the English Club, where the stakes
were much higher than in private houses,
and especially when he was induced to
join a party of very respectable gen-
tlemen, in one of the most respectable
houses of the Old Equerries Quarter,
where gambling went on all night. On
an occasion of this kind his losses were
sure to be heavy.
	Dancing-parties were not infrequent,
to say nothing of a couple of obligatory
balls every winter. Fathers way, in such
cases, was to have everything done in a
good style, whatever the expense. But
at the same time such niggardliness was
practiced in our house in daily life that
if I were to recount it, I should be ac-
cused of exaggeration. It is said of a
family of pretenders to the throne of
France, renowned for their truly regal
hunting-parties, that in their every-day
life even the tallow candles are minutely
counted. The same sort of miserly eco-
nomy ruled in our house with regard to
everything; so much so that when we,
the children of the house, grew up, we
detested all saving and counting. How-
ever, in the Old Equerries Quarter such
a mode of life only raised my father in
public esteem. The old prince, it was
said, seems to be sharp over money at
home; but he knows how a nobleman
ought to live.
	In our quiet and clean lanes that was
the kind of life which was most in re-
spect. One of our neighbors, General
D ,kept his house up in very grand
style; and yet the most comical scenes
took place every morning between him
and his cook. Breakfast over, the old
general, smoking his pipe, would himself
order the dinner.
	Well, my boy, he would say to the
cook, who appeared in snow-white attire,
to-day we shall not be many; only a
couple of guests. You will make us a
soup, you know, with some spring deli-
cacies,  green peas, French beans, and
so on. You have not given us any as
yet, and madam, you know, likes a good
French spring soup.
	Yes, sir.
	Then, anything you like as an en-
tr6e.
	Yes, sir.
	Of course, asparagus is not yet in
season, but I saw yesterday such nice
bundles of it in the shops.
	Yes, sir; eight shillings the bundle.
	Quite right! Then, we are sick of
your roasted chickens and turkeys; you
ought to get something for a change.
	Some venison, sir?
	Yes, yes; anything for a change.
	And when the six courses of the din-
ner had been decided on, the old gener-
al would ask, Now, how much shall I
give you for to - days expenses? Six
shillings will do, I suppose?
	One pound, sir.
	What nonsense, my boy! Here are</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00367" SEQ="0367" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="361">	The Autobiography of a Revolutionist.	361

six shillings; I assure you that s quite
enough.
	Eight shillings for asparagus, five for
the vegetables.
	Now, look here, my dear boy, be rea-
sonable. I 11 go as high as seven-and-
six, and you must be economical.
	And the bargaining would go on thus
for half an hoar, until the two would
agree upon fourteen shillings and six-
pence, with the understanding that the
morrows dinner should not cost more
than three shillings. Whereupon the
general, quite happy at having made such
a good bargain, would take his sledge,
make a round of the fashionable shops,
and return quite radiant, bringing for
his wife a bottle of exquisite perfume,
for which he had paid a fancy price in
a French shop, and announcing to his
only daughter that a new velvet mantle
 something very simple and very
costly  would be sent for her to try on
that afternoon.
	All our relatives, who were numer-
ous on my. fathers side, lived exactly
in the same way; and if a new spirit
occasionally made its appearance, it
usually took the form of some religious
passion. Thus, a Prince Gagm~rin joined
the Jesuit order, again to the scandal
of all Moscow; another young prince
entered a monastery, while several older
ladies became fanatic devotees.
	There was a single exception. One
of our nearest relatives, Prince  let me
call him Mfrski, had spent his youth at
St. Petersburg as an officer of the guard.
He took no interest in keeping his own
tailors and cabinet-makers, for his house
was furnished in a grand modern style,
and his wearing apparel was all made in
the best St. Petersburg shops. Gambling
was not his propensity, he played cards
only to keep company with ladies; but
his weak point was his dinner-table, upon
which he spent incredible sums of money.
	Lent and Easter were his chief epochs
of extravagance. When the Great Lent
came, and it would not have been proper
to eat meat, cream, or butter, ho seized
the opportunity to invent all sorts of
delicacies in the way of fish. The best
shops of the two capitals were ransacked
for that purpose; special emissaries were
dispatched from his estate to the mouth
of the Y6lga, to bring back on post-horses
(there was no railway at that time) a
sturgeon of great size or some extraor-
dinarily cured fish. And when Easter
came, there was no end to his inventions.
	Easter, in Russia, is the most vener-
ated and also the gayest of the yearly
festivals. It is the festival of spring.
The immense heaps of snow which have
been lying during the winter along the
streets of Moscow rapidly thaw, and
roaring streams run down the streets;
not like a thief who creeps in by in-
sensible degrees, but frankly and openly
spring comes,  every day bringing with
it a change in the state of the snow and
the progress of the buds on the trees; the
night frosts only keep the thaw within
reasonable bounds. The last week of
the Great Lent, Passion Week, was kept
in Moscow, in my childhood, with ex-
treme solemnity; it was a time of gen-
eral mourning, and crowds of people
went to the churches to listen to the un-
pressive reading of those passages of
the Gospels which relate the sufferings
of the Christ. Not only were meat,
eggs, and butter not eaten, but even fish
was refused; some of the most rigorous
taking no food at all on Good Friday.
The more striking was the contrast when
Easter came.
	On Saturday every one attended the
night service, which began in a mourn-
ful way. Then, suddenly, at midnight,
the resurrection news was announced.
All the churches were at once illuminat-
ed, and gay peals of bells resounded from
the hundreds of sacred edifices. Gen-
eral rejoicing began. All the people
kissed one another thrice on the cheeks,
repeating the resurrection words, and the
churches, now flooded with light, shone
with the gay toilettes of the ladies. The</PB>

poorest woman had a new dress; if she
had only one new dress a year, she would
get it for that night.
	At the same time, Easter was, and is
still, the signal for a real debauch in
eating. Special Easter cream cheeses
(paskka) and Easter bread (koclich) are
prepared; and every one, no matter how
poor he or she may be, must have be it
only a small paskha and a small koolich,
with at least one egg painted red, to be
consecrated in the church, and to be used
afterward to break the Lent. With
most old Russians, eating began at night,
after a short Easter mass, immediate-
ly after the consecrated food had been
brought from church; but in the houses
of the nobility the ceremony was post-
poned till Sunday morning, when a ta-
ble was covered with all sorts of viands,
cheeses and pastry, and all the servants
came to exchange with their masters three
kisses and a red-painted egg. Through-
out Easter week a table spread with
Easter food stood in the great hall, and
every visitor was invited to partake.
	On this occasion Prince Mirski sur-
passed himself. Whether he was at St.
Petersburg or at Moscow, messengers
brought to his house, from his estate, a
specially prepared cream cheese for the
paskha, and his cook managed to make
out of it a piece of artistic confectionery.
Other messengers were dispatched to the
province of Novgorod to get a bears
ham, which was cured for the princes
Easter table. And while the princess,
with her twe daughters, visited the most
austere monasteries, in which the night
service would last three or four hours in
succession, and spent all Passion Week
in the most mournful condition of mind,
eating only a piece of dry bread between
the visits she paid to Russian, Roman,
and Protestant preachers, her husband
made every morning the tour of the well-
known Milutin shops at St. Petersburg,
where all possible delicacies are brought
from the ends of the earth. There he
used to select the most extravagant dain-
ties for his Easter table. Hundreds of
visitors came to his house, and were asked
just to taste ~ this or that extraordinary
thing.
	The end of it was that the prince man-
aged literally to eat up a considerable
fortune. His richly furnished house and
beautiful estate were sold, and when he
and his wife were old they had nothing
left, not even a home, and were com-
pelled to live with their children.
	No wonder that when the emancipa-
tion of the serfs came, nearly all these
families of the Old Equerries Quarter
were ruined. But I must not anticipate
events.

A LAWYER WITH A STYLE.

	SIR HENRY MAINE was a lawyer with
a style, and belongs, by method and
genius, among men of letters. The lit-
erary world looks askance upon a law-
yer, and is slow to believe that the grim
and formal matter of his studies can by
any alchemy of style be transmuted into
literature. Calfskin seems to it the most
unlikely of all bindings to contain any-
thing engaging to read. Lawyers, in
their turn, are apt to associate the word
literature almost exclusively with
works of the imagination, and to think
	style a thing wholly misleading and
unscientific. They demand plain busi-
ness of their writers, and suspect a book
that is pleasing of charlatanry. And yet
a really great law writer will often make
his way easily and at once into the ranks
of men of letters. Blackstones Com-
mentaries have been superseded and re-
superseded, again and again, by all sorts
of changes and restatements of the law
of England, but they have lived serenely
on through their century and more of
assured vitality, and must still be read
by every student of the law, in America
no less than in England, because of their
scope, their virility, their luminous meth-
od, their easy combination of system
with lucidity, their distinction of style,
their quality as of the patriciate of let-
ters. It does not seem to make any dif-
ference whether they are correct or not,
and we return to them, after reading
Bentham and Austin, their arch-critics,
 a little shamefacedly, it may be, 
to find our zest and relish for them not
a whit abated. It is noteworthy that,
though the profession has so thumbed
and subsisted upon them, they were not
written for the profession, but for the
young gentlemen of England, whom the
learned Vinerian professor wished to in-
struct in the institutions of their country.
They are stripped as much as might be
of technical phrase and detail, and are
meant to stand in the general company
of books, the servants and instructors of
all comers. They are meant for the
world, and seem instinctively to make
themselves acceptable to it.
	Sir Henry Maine, whether he was
conscious of it or not, won his way to a
like standing among men of letters by a
like disposition and object. Without ex-
ception, I believe, his books were made
up out of lectures delivered either to
young law students, not yet masters of
the technicalities of the law, or to lay
audiences, to which professional erudi-
tion would have been unintelligible. He
never seemed to stand inside the law,
while he wrote, but outside; not ex-
plaining its interior mysteries, but set-
ting its history round about it,  show-
ing whence it came, whence it took its
notions, its forms, its stringent sanctions,
what its youth had been, and its growth,
and why its maturity showed it come to
so hard a fibre of formal doctriac. He
viewed it always as something that the
general life of man had brought forth,
as a natural product of society; and his
thought went round about society to
compass its explanation. He moves,
therefore, in a large region, where it is
refreshing to be of his company, where
wide prospects open with every comment,
and you seem, as he talks, to be upon a

style of the man, but that is in any case
a mystery. His method of thinking car-

way, he must write in that way. You

out for landscapes, nor a man without
gift of speech sallying forth to explore
the thoughts which he cannot express.

men can think without words or not.
I only know that flight is a question of
wings, and that you do not find minds
without strong pinions poised very high
in the spaces of the air.
	I do not think that Sir Henry Maine
himself understood this matter; it was
not necessary that he should. In an ad-
dress which he delivered to the native
students at Calcutta, he warned them,
very sensibly, to beware, if they wished
to write effective English, of too delib-
erately striving to write well. What
you should regard, he says, is, not
the language, but the thought; and if the
thought be clearly and vividly conceived,
the proper diction, if the writer be an
educated man, will be sure to follow.
You have only to look to the greatest
masters of English style to satisfy your-
selves of the truth of what I have said,
 and yet his example is not very con-
vincing. Look at any one page of
Shakespeare. After you have penetrated
beneath the poetry and beneath the wit,
you will find that the page is perfectly
loaded with thought.
	After you have penetrated beneath
the poetry and beneath the wit! This
is a dark saying; who shall receive it?
After you have penetrated beneath the
exquisite form of the features, have
ceased to observe the curve of the cheek
and the sweet bloom upon it, and the
seductive light in the eye, no doubt you
shall find flesh and blood; but there
is everywhere flesh and blood to be
found without line or color to give it dis-
tinction. Weight of thought, no doubt,
but books by the thousand have been
foundered and sunk by mere weight of
matter. Sir Henry Maine himself shall
not survive by reason of the abundance
and validity of his thought, but by rea-
son of his form and art. Maine can
no more become obsolete through the in-
dustry and ingenuity of modern schol-
ars, Sir Frederick Pollock declared,
than Montesquieu could be made ob-
solete by the legislation of Napoleon.
Facts will be corrected, the order and
proportion of ideas will vary, new diffi-
culties will call for new ways of solution,
useful knowledge will serve its turn and
be forgotten; but in all true genius, per-
haps, there is a touch of Art; Maines
genius was not only touched with Art,
but eminently artistic; and Art is im-
mortal. Ay, art is immortal,  not
thought alone and of itself, but thought
perfectly conceived, formed, and vivi-
fied. Maine disliked what is called
fine writing, as every man of taste
must; and he was no coiner of striking
phrases. The only sentence he ever
wrote which his friends claim to have
seen going abroad upon its own merits
as a saying is this: Except the blind
forces of Nature, nothing moves in this
world which is not Greek in its origin,
	which is neither epigrammatic nor
true. Epigrams were not in his way.
If the cats question to the ugly duckling
in the fairy tale had been put to him,
and he had been asked, Can you emit
sparks ? he would have been obliged to
admit, with the duckling, that he could
not; but, like the ugly duckling, he
turned out to be a swan, sovereign in
grace, if not in dexterity. His style
does not play in points of light, but acts
far and wide and with a fine suffusion,
like the sun in the open.
	You will best understand the power
and the art of the man if you study his
life and work, what he did and the man-
ner in which he did it. Not that you
will know any better, after the story is
told than before, how to analyze his
power or explain his art; but you will
know very clearly just what he was and
stood for,  of just what he was a mas-
ter, and how his mastery displayed it-
self. What a master in any art did is
always inseparable, in the last analysis,
from what he was. The life of a writer
has in it little that can be told, and
delicate health held Sir Henry Maine
always to a very quiet level. He had
no adventures as a boy,  except that</PB>

his mother and aunt came near kill-
ing him with an overdose of opium;
and his youth was without any irregu-
larity except overstudy,  which for a
normal youth would be very irregular.
His father was a Dr. James Maine, of
whom we are told nothing except that
he was born at Kelso, near the Scottish
border, and that he lived for a short
time after his son Henrys birth on the
island of Jersey. The boys full name
was Henry James Sumner Maine, his
godfather being the excellent Dr. Sum-
ner, Bishop of Chester, and afterward
Archbishop of Canterbury. He was
born near Leighton, August 15, 1822.
His mother was Eliza Fell, who came
of a family of good position living in
the neighborhood of Reading. She is
said to have been a clever and accom-
plished woman, and it turned out that
she was to be her gifted sons sole guard-
ian. Family difficulties separated her
from her husband, and she removed while
the lad was in his second year to a re-
sidence at Henley - on - Thames. There
Henry Maine got his first schooling;
thence he went, when he was but seven,
to Christs Hospital, where Dr. Sumner
had been able to place him; and from
Christs Hospital he went, as Exhibi-
tioner, to Pembroke College, Cambridge,
in 1840, at the age of eighteen,  a
slender, clear-voiced, alert lad, as fragile,
almost, as a tender girl, but full of a
masculine energy, which showed in his
lively eye, at once bright and deep, per-
ceiving and thoughtful, and in his speech,
which was very definite and sure of its
mark,  a lad whom one could have
wished to see much in the sun, to put
color in his cheeks, but who could not
often be drawn away from his books, and
showed pale, like the student. He went
in for all the prizes, and got most of
them; was elected Foundation Scholar
of his college; won medals for English
verse, Latin hexameters, Latin odes,
Greek and Latin epigrams; became
Craven University Scholar and Senior
Classic; and finally won the Chancel-
lors Senior Classical Medal, putting him-
self through the unpalatable discipline
of taking the honors in mathematics ne-
cessary to qualify him for winning it.
Pembroke had no vacant fellowship to
offer him, but he was made tutor at
Trinity Hall immediately upon his grad-
uation, in 1844; and three years later,
when he was but twenty-five, was ap-
pointed Regius Professor of Civil Law.
	I was curious, said a gentleman
who had had the good luck to be coached
by Maine at Trinity Hall, I was cu-
rious to see how this tutor of mine, so
young as he was, about two years my
junior, would get on at first. . - . The
result removed all doubts and surpassed
my most sanguine expectations. I could
feel that I was being admirably jockeyed.
He had the greatest dexterity in impress.
ing his knowledge upon others, made
explanations that came to the point at
once and could not be misunderstood,
corrected mistakes in a way one was not
apt to forget, supplied you with endless
variety of happy expressions for com-
position and dodges in translation; in
short, was just the man to make the
pace for a pupil who wanted to study.
Dodges in translation! Are we to
understand that this young gentleman of
twenty-two had already learned how to
march straight across a subject; how to
avoid details, and yet imply them within
a general proposition? Here is certain-
ly the Henry Maine we have read, with
his explanations that come to the point
at once and cannot be misunderstood,
and his skill at inclusive statement. He
was backward to speak before his eld-
ers, the same witness tells us, and had
the rare merit of being a talker or a lis-
tener, as circumstances demanded, but
when he did speak put in keen and
rapid remarks that told like knock-down
blows. This will not do for a descrip-
tion of Maines written style. That is
not keen and rapid, and there is nothing
like the accent of a blow about it It is</PB>

deliberate, rather, and calm, and makes
serene show of strength. But men who
write thus, with a sort of restrained and
chastened force, often speak in forms
more direct and eager. It may well
be, besides, that mere illumination has
the effect of point, as a perfect illus-
tration acts like a stroke of wit, and
Maines conversational hits may have
seemed keen simply because they shone
with light. A crystal will often give
out the same sharp line of light that
will flash to you from the edge of a
swords blade. But we are not con-
cerned with that. There is enough in
this picture of the young tutor to make
it evident that the boy was, as always,
father to the man. Those who were
intimate with him during these years,
says another who knew him then, will
not easily forget his face and figure,
marked with the delicacy of weak health,
but full to overflowing with sensitive
nervous energy,  his discursive bril-
liancy of imagination and intellect, his
clear-cut style and precise accuracy of
expression, and his absolute power of
concentrating himself on the subject im-
mediately before him. His mind was so
graceful that strangers might have over-
looked its strength, while the buoyancy
of his enthusiasm was never beyond the
controlof the most critical judgment.
It was hard to drag bun away from his
rooms and his books, even for the ordi-
nary minimum of constitutional exercise,
though his spirits and width of interest
made him at all times a joyous compan-
ion. Here was no dig, who loved
a book because he liked to sit still and
save himself the trouble of thinking, but
a youth to whom books were quick; not
stuffing him, but setting his faculties in
the way to satisfy themselves. It was
reported of him, many years afterward,
that he could pluck all tbe heart out of
a thick volume while another man was
reading a hundred pages; and no doubt
he liked it, not because it was a book and
thick, but because it had a heart in it.
It is in such a way and at such a time
that a mind fit for mastery learns how
to use books.
	Maine married in 1847, the year he
was chosen Regius Professor of Civil Law,
 married his cousin, Miss Jane Maine.
His marriage led him to look for wider
fields of employment, and by 1850 he
had qualified for and been called to the
bar. He soon found practice of his
profession go hard with his health, how-
ever, and turned more and more away
from it, to write for the more serious
public prints and exercise his high gifts
as a lecturer. Like Walter Bagehot, he
had first tried his hand as a writer for
the public upon an exposition of the
character and purposes of Louis Napo-
leon, condemning from the outset the un-
constitutional aims which Bagehot was
afterward to justify. Bagehot tried to
look at the whole matter from a French
point of view; Maine looked at it always
as an English constitutionalist, and could
find no tolerant word for the imperial
charlatan, who was just then calling him-
self president. So long, he said, as
the French common weal moves steadi-
ly forward, to strike it down or trip it up,
at the cost of turning into gall the best
and wholesomest blood in the whole of
France, would be a great piece of fool-
ishness no less than a great crime. He
showed his political sympathies at home
by hating Mr. Disraeli very heartily.
Already you are manifesting consider-
able aptitude for the policy which has
conducted your lead~r to eminence, he
says to Disraelis followers in 1849, with
a biting sneer; already the Jacobin-
ical coloring of your language and argu-
ment shows that you are not indisposed
to alternate conservative commonplace
with revolutionary verse and radical
prose. All you have to learn is the art
of diverting attention while you shift
your views, the unintelligible gabble of
the thimblerigger as he changes his
peas. When you have mastered this ac-
complishment, the rest is quite simple.</PB>

There is here good partisan vigor. The
strokes are direct and palpable, and show
the true zest of the political journalist.
In 1852, two years after his call to the
bar, Mr. Maine was appointed reader in
Roman law and jurisprudence to the
Inns of Court, and began courses of pub-
lic lectures, in that beautiful hall of the
Middle Temple in which Twelfth Night
was first acted, which were to lead him
to the chief work of his life. But the
serious studies of his lectureship did not
draw him away from his writing for the
public journals. In 1855 the Saturday
Review was established, with an extraor-
dinary staff of writers,  among them
the accomplished gentleman who is now
the Marquis of Salisbury, Sir William
Harcourt, Sir James Stephen, Goldwin
Smith, Walter Bagehot, Professor Owen,
and Henry Maine. Maine did no less
than the rest of this brilliant company
to give immediate prestige to the Satur-
day Review. Mr. Bagehot used to de-
clare his nerves much too delicate to
take the direct impact of the Spectator.
Its contents were much too pungent and
sanguine to be received without due pre-
paration, and he always got his wife
to break it to him at breakfast; and
some of the rest of us have felt much
the same way about the Saturday Re-
view. Not that it kept the spanking
pace given it by these men when they
were young; it grew dense in substance,
rather, as it grew old, and had finally to
be taken in about the proportion of one
part to ten parts of water. Maine turned
his hand to almost every kind of writing
to quicken its pages, and for six years
made it his business to enrich it with
every matter of thought he could con-
tribute.
	At the very outset of his service as
lecturer at the Inns of Court he had
been stricken with an illness which near-
ly cost him his life; but he came out of
it with undaunted spirits and energies
not a whit dulled,  his thoughts burn-
ing within him like flame within an ala-
baster vessel. Those who heard him
read his lectures were struck by the
musical power of his voice, and by the
unimpeded flow of his sentences, running
clear as crystal; and those who con-
versed with him marveled at the ease,
the lucidity, the telling force of his talk.
It was singularly bright, alert, and de-
cided, one of these reports; you could
not walk a couple of hundred yards with
him without hearing something that in-
terested you, and he had the enviable
power of raising every subject that was
started into a higher atmosphere. In
later life he became much more silent,
and did not seem to put his intelligence
as quickly alongside that of the person
to whom he was talking. But it was
in this time of high tension and quick
play of mind that he did the work which
has since held the attention of the world;
for in 1861, at the age of thirty-nine9 he
published his now celebrated volume on
Ancient Law,  his first book, and un-
questionably his greatest. It was the
condensed and perfected substance of
his lectures at the Inns ~f Court. It
was in one sense not an original work:
it was not founded on original research.
Its author had broken no new ground
and made no discoveries. He had sim-
ply taken the best historians of Roman
law,  great German scholars chiefly,
 had united and vivified, extended and
illustrated, their conclusions in his own
comprehensive way; had drawn, with
that singularly firm hand of his, the long
lines that connected antique states of
mind with unquestioned but otherwise
inexplicable modern principles of law;
had made obscure things luminous, and
released a great body of cloistered learn-
ing into the world, where common stn
dents read and plod and seek to under.
stand. What Bagehot says of Sydney
Smith we may apply to Maine: he had
no fangs for recondite research. No
man of our time did so much for the re-
vival of the study of Roman law, said
a close friend and intimate of Maines,</PB>

after his death; but it is greatly to be
doubted whether he had any special fa-
miliarity with the Pandects or the Code.
He had a power of seeing the general
in the particular, says the same friend,
which we do not think has been equaled
in literary history. His works are full
of generalizations which are as remark-
able for their clearness and sobriety as
for their intrinsic probability, and which
are reached, not by any very elaborate
study of detailed evidence, but by a kind
of intuition. Men who tear the heart
out of a thick volume while a slow and
careful man reads a hundred pages are
not the men to pause over details with
a nice scrutiny: they go eagerly on in
search of the defining borders of the large
land of detail.
	Persons who suppose that Maines
Ancient Law is merely a textbook for
lawyers will be very much and very de-
lightfully surprised if they will but take
it down from the shelf and read it,  as
much surprised as young law students
are who plunge into Blackstone because
they must, and find to their astonish-
ment that those deep waters are not a
little refreshing, and that the law, after
all, is no dismal science. The book has
that dignity, that spirit, that clear and
freshened air, that untechnical dress and
manner of the world which belong to the
writing of cultured gentlemen who know
the touch that makes literature. It is
hard to explain, apart from a reading of
the book itself, what it is that gives this
quality of distinction and charm to An-
cient Law. You cannot easily illustrate
it by quotations from the book, unless
you quote a whole chapter; for Maine
was no coiner of phrases, as I have said,
and one passage is much like another,
 no one page of the volume contains its
method condensed, its art displayed in
little.
	No doubt, the most typical and ad-
mirable parts of the book are those
which constitute the warp and woof of
the sustained passages of reasoning which
are the body of every chapter; but no
part of them can easily or fairly be de-
tached. In speaking of Maines great
work, soon after his death, the London
Times says: The style was so lucid, the
reasoning was so clear and cogent, the il-
lustrative matter was so aptly chosen, the
analogies were so dexterously handled,
the survey was so broad, the grasp of
principles was so firm, the whole fabric
of the argument was articulated in so
masterly a fashion, that the reader was
easily tempted to suppose that Ancient
Law must have been as easy to write as
it was fascinating to read. But Maine
was not a rapid or an easy writer, we
are told (and the article was evidently
written by some friend who spoke from
personal knowledge); it was a matter
of infinite pains with him to rear the
symmetrical structures he has left us
in his published works. But when the
work was done, he took the scaffolding
away, gathered up his tools, cleared
the ground, and left no trace of daily
labor. There are no footnotes; there is
no discussion of the books and materials
out of which he took the finely fitted
pieces of his structure; no seams or joints
show, no traces of the tool: the work
stands single, self-consistent, and com-
plete, as if it were a fine, unassisted piece
of creation. Everything he wrote reads
like the utterance of a very superior
person, who speaks always out of his own
knowledge, observes from a high coign
of vantage, and concludes the matter with
an authoritative judgment. And so you
get the feeling that he has had no prede-
cessors, and fears no successors.
	I do not say this in disparagement of
this great writer; it seems to me ne-
cessary to say it simply by way of exe-
gesis,  the manner is there, and we
shall not understand Maine unless we
reckon with it. It is partly, perhaps
chiefly, due to the absence of footnotes
and references. He seems to have cov-
ered all this wide field without assist-
ance from other authors, and to feel the</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00375" SEQ="0375" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="369">	A Lawyer with a Style.	369

need of no support of extraneous author-
ity in any statement. He seems to have
found it all out himself. Starting with
a little fact here and a venerable tradi-
tion there, as one of his critics has said,
he lays a foundation with these, and
proceeds to build up an edifice from stags
to stage, till those who do not watch the
process very closely imagine a great deal
proved which, in reality, is highly plau-
sible conjecture, with the result that
much that the author himself puts for-
ward as only theory has been assumed
to be settled doctrine. You get much
the same impression in reading Momm-
sen s History of Ronie. Here, too, you
are without references, and a bold mas-
ter of statement confidently builds up the
great story of Rome before your eyes,
age by age, the earliest times as definite-
ly as the latest, with the air of one who
remembers rather than with the caution
of one who has heard and been led to in-
fer, until at last you are fairly awed, and
wonder whether the master will ever gra-
ciously vouchsafe to you any hint of his
sources of information.
	But it is more than the mere absence of
footnotes: it is also the tone,  the tone
of perfect confidence. Maines books
are one and all books of generalization,
 of the sort of generalization which
sweeps together the details of centuries
into a single statement and interpreta-
tion. Maine is seldom, in fact, daring
or beyond the evidence in his broad judg-
ments: they were come at, you shall
find, if you will take the pains to test
them, by slow consideration and a care-
ful elimination of the elements of error;
they are sober, too, and without flavor
of invention or of radical fancy. They
spring always from the reason, never
from the literary imagination. There is
the air of a scientific calm and dispas-
sionateness about them. But, for all
that, they are so confidently spoken, they
range over such spaces of time and in-
ference, look so far abroad upon the for-
tunes and policies of men and nations,

have such a spacious way of thought
about them, and are set to so high a
tune of stately diction that they quite
overwhelm us with a sense of their im-
portance not only, but of the importance
of their author also. A man of the cali-
bre of Montesquien and de Tocqueville,
the Times calls him. He brought,
it says, to the study of law, politics,
and institutions an intelligence as pen-
etrating as theirs, a grasp of mind as
comprehensive, a judgment as sober and
impartial, and a method incomparably
more searching and fruitful,  a style,
it might have added, less personal, more
cosmic, as if it were conceived by some
general intelligence. And this, let it be
said at once, is Maines greatness. It
would be easy to show that he got prac-
tically all of the material of Ancient Law
at second hand; it would doubtless be
possible to prove that he had no gift for
investigation, and, though a man of the
widest reading, possessed no real erudi-
tion. His power lay in the art and mys-
tery of divination. It has been said that
he did nothing more than interpret for
English lawyers and students of institu-
tions the work of the great students of
comparative jurisprudence in Germany;
but this is not a judgment that can he
held by those who are sensible of the ef-
fects which lie beyond detail. Without
interpretation detail is dead, and Maine
was a master of interpretation. Inter-
pretation does not merely give details sig-
nificance; it adds something of its own,
and shows that, at any rate in divination,
the whole is greater than the sum of the
parts. It is fact enhanced and vitalized
by thought. It is the face of learning
quickened and made eloquent by the suf-
fused color, the swift play of light in the
eye, the subtle change of line about the
mouth that bring the spirit forth which
dwells within. It is, to change the figure,
a guide to the high places from which the
details of the plain may be seen massed
and in proportion not only, hut made
more significant also in their relations</PB>

than they are in themselves,  added to
by the touch of perspective. This is the
highest function of learning.
	It is this, no doubt, which gives us
the sense of exhilaration we get in read-
ing Maine: we are moving in high spaces,
and command always a broad outlook.
And yet we are not in the air; there is
no uneasy sense of having our feet off
the ground. There is in every general-
ization that Maine makes a reassuring
implication of detail,  just as there is
in a towering mass of crag and moun-
tain: we know somehow that the fine,
aspiring lines are carried by granite and
rooted in the centre of the solid globe.
There is in such writing more than a
sense of elevation, however: there is
also a sense of movement,  the steady
drawing on of a great theme,  a move-
ment strong, regular, smooth, inevitable,
like that of a great river, sweeping from
view to view, but never turning upon its
course, never doubting of its direction,
unimpeded, noiseless, more powerful than
swift. This large and general power
was characteristic of Maine in all that
he did. The year after the publication
of Ancient Law, he was offered, and ac-
cepted, the post of law member in the
council of the governor-general of India.
He removed to India, and the next seven
years of his life were spent in a deep ab-
sorption in the affairs of that great de-
pendency, which has drawn to its admin-
istration so much of the best genius of
the English race. He showed in council
the same gifts that made him a great
writer,  those singular gifts of gener-
alization, which are, after all, in their
last analysis, executive in kind. His
method, his writings, and his speeches
at the Indian council board, says Sir
Alfred Lyall, have had a strong and
lasting effect upon all subsequent ways
of dealing with matters pertaining to
India, whether in science or practical
politics. He possessed an extraordinary
power of appreciating unfamiliar facts
and apparently irrational beliefs, of ex
tracting their essence and the principle
of their vitality, of separating what still
has life and use from what is harmful or
obsolete, and of stating the result of the
whole operation in some clear and con-
vincing sentence. The local expert,
he adds, almost with a smile, the local
expert, who, after years of labor in the
field of observation, found himself with
certain indefinite impressions of the
meaning or outcome of his collected facts,
often found the whole issue of the in-
quiry exactly and conclusively stated in
one of Maines lucid generalizations.
It is odd to learn, after hearing of the
mass of difficult work he crowded into
those seven years in India, that Maine
was sometimes privately charged with
indolence and idleness by his colleagues:
and yet the charge carries with it a cer-
tain interesting significance. To those
whose idea of labor is, to be forever
poring upon a task, forever plodding
from record to record, from memoran-
dum to memorandum, he must of course
have seemed idle. For all he loved read-
ing and preferred his books to a walk
abroad, his was not a mind for searching
and sorting and annotating. It was a
mind, rather, for brooding, and did its
work with no outward show of being
busy. No man hustles at thinking. The
greater sorts of flight are made without
noisy beat of wing.
	Maines appointment in 1862 to be
law member of the governor-generals
council in India determined the rest of
his career: from that time till the end
of his life, in 1888, his chief energies
were given to the great and arduous busi-
ness of governing India. A writer in
the Spectator declares him to have been
for seven years the avowed, and for
twenty-six years the actual, English law-
maker for that troublesome depend-
ency, and ascribes to him nearly three
hundred successful statutes. He left
India in 1869, and upon his return to
England accepted, in 1870, the position
of Corpus Professor of Jurisprudence at</PB>

Oxford,  a position specially created
that he might occupy it; but in the
autumn of the next year, 1871, he was
appointed to a seat in the council of the
secretary of state for India, and re-
turned to the work for which he had so
singularly fitted himself. He continued
to lecture at Oxford for seven or eight
years, speaking every year to an eager
and steadily increasing company of seri-
ous students in the quiet little hall of
Corpus Christi College, and the fruits of
his work appeared from time to time in
that series of interesting volumes which
we now always read along with Ancient
Law, as expanded gloss and commen-
tary: Village Communities, East and
West, published in 1871 ; The Early His-
tory of Institutions, published in 1875;
and Early Law and Custom, published
in 1883. These all grew out of his Ox-
ford lectures, or out of articles which he
had contributed to the reviews, and are
rich with the knowledge he had taken
from India and from the later students
of institutions in the West. Every
man, he says, in an interesting passage
to be found in his Village Communities,
	every man is under a temptation to
overrate the importance of the subjects
which have more than others occupied
his own mind; but it certainly seems to
me that two kinds of knowledge are in-
dispensable, if the study of historical and
philosophical jurisprudence is to be car-
ried very far in England,  knowledge
of India and knowledge of Roman law:
of India, because it is the great repository
of verifiable phenomena of ancient usage
and ancient juridical thought; of Roman
law, because, viewed in the whole course
of its development, it connects these an-
cient usages and this ancient juridical
thought with the legal ideas of our own
day. Ignorance of India he thought
more discreditable to Englishmen than
ignorance of Roman law, and at the
same time more unintelligible in them.
It is more discreditable, he said, be-
cause it requires no very intimate ac
quaintance with contemporary foreign
opinion to recognize the abiding truth of
de Tocquevilles remark, that the con-
quest and government of India are real-
ly the achievements in the history of a
people which it is the fashion abroad to
consider unromantic. The ignorance is,
moreover, unintelligible, because know-
ledge on the subject is extremely plenti-
ful and extremely accessible, since Eng-
lish society is full of men who have made
it the study of a life pursued with an
ardor of public spirit which would be
exceptional even in the field of British
domestic politics. It is evident from
the strong pulse that beats in these sen-
tences that a new spirit and a new and
absorbing interest have come into the
writers mind because of his actual con-
tact with the life of the East. It colors
henceforth every part of his thought.
If there were an ideal Toryism, he
writes, in the midst of the general elec-
tion of 1885, I should probably be a
Tory; but I should not find it easy to
say which party I should wish. to win
now. The truth is, India and the In-
dia Office make one judge public men by
standards which have little to do with
political opinion.
	It was in 1885 that his volume on
Popular Government showed us how far
India and the India Office had formed
his opinions. No doubt he was by con-
stitution and temperament a Tory, 
most men of delicate health and cautious
thought must be. Now and again some
invalid touched with genius gets the air of
the sea and the quick currents of the out-
of-door world into his blood, as Robert
Louis Stevenson did ; but men like Maine
dull their blood while they are young by
close, confining study, and no subsequent
experience can take them out of the at-
mosphere of rooms and books. Popular
Government is the only book in which
Maine leaves his accustomed fields of
study to make practical test of his opin-
ions in the field of politics,  which is,
after all, an out-of-door, and not an in-

door world. The book abounds in good
things. Its examination of the abstract
doctrines which underlie democracy is
in his best manner, every sentence
of it tells. The style is pointed, too,
and animated beyond his wont,  hur-
ried here and there into a quick pace
by force of feeling, by ardor against an
adversary. He finds, besides, with his
unerring instinct for the heart of a ques-
tion, just where the whole theory and
practice of democracy show the elements
that will make it last or fail. After
making all due qualifications, he says,
I do not deny to Democracies some
portion of the advantage which so mas-
culine a thinker as Bentham claimed for
them. But, putting this advantage at the
highest, it is more than compensated by
one great disadvantage. Of all the forms
of government, Democracy is by far the
most difficult. Little as the governing
multitude is conscious of this difficulty,
prone as the masses are to aggravate it
by their avidity for taking more and
more powers into tkeir direct manage-
ment, it is a fact which experience has
placed beyond all dispute. It is the dif-
ficulty of democratic government that
mainly accounts for its ephemeral dura-
tion. Unquestionably this is true, and
is the central truth of the whole matter.
He is right, too, beyond gainsaying, when
he says that the fact that what is called
the will of the people really consists in
their adopting the opinion of one person
or a few persons admits of a very con-
vincing illustration from experience.
The ruling multitude will only form
an opinion by following the opinion of
somebody: it may be, of a great party
leader; it may be, of a small local pol-
itician; it may be, of an organized as-
sociation; it may be, of an impersonal
newspaper. But he is wrong  and
the error is very radical  in supposing
that democracy really rests on a theory,
and is nothing 6ut a form of govern-
ment. It is a form of character, where
it is successful, a form of national
character; and is based, not upon a theo-
ry, but upon the steady evolutions of ex-
perience. Mr. Morley was not just in
describing the book as a rattling politi-
cal pamphlet,  though he did say some
fine things about it. His review of it
brought forth, among other things, that
fine remark of his, that any human in-
stitution will look black if held up against
the light that shines in Utopia. But
Maine cannot in fairness be called a par-
tisan. The real and very astonishing
fault of the book is, that its criticism
rings false to the standards he had so
greatly set up in the works which gave
him his high fame. He speaks of de-
mocracy in the United States as if it
were only one success amidst a host of
failures, and had been nullified by the
lamentable experiences of France and
Spain and the republics of turbulent
South America. The stability of the
government of the United States is, he
admits, a political fact of the first
importance; but the inferences which
might be drawn from it, he says, are
much weakened, if not destroyed, by the
remarkable spectacle furnished by the
numerous republics set up from the
Mexican border-line to the Straits of
Magellan. The democracy of North
America  to be found in Canada no
less than in the United States  is as
natural, as normal, as inevitable a pro-
duct of steady, equable, unbroken his-
tory as the Corpus Juris of Justinian;
and the heady miscarriages of attempted
democracy in Spanish countries are as
easily and as satisfactorily explicable as
the principles of contract or the history
of inheritance by will. No champion
of the comparative method of historical
study ought to have discredited his own
canons by comparing things incompara-
ble.
	Maines style in Popular Government
is, as I have said, much more spirited
than his style elsewhere, and smacks
sometimes with a very racy flavor. The
short history of the United States, he</PB>

says, has established one momentous
negative conclusion. When a democra-
cy governs, it is not safe to leave un-
settled any important question concern-
ing the exercise of public powers. I
might give many instances of this, but
the most conclusive is the war of seces-
sion, which was entirely owing to the
omission of the fathers to provide be-
forehand for the solution of certain con-
stitutional problems, lest they should stir
the topic of negro slavery. It would
seem that, by a wise Constitution, demo-
cracy may be made nearly as calm as
water in a great artificial reservoir; but
if there is a weak point anywhere in the
structure, the mighty force which it con-
trols will burst through it and spread de-
struction far and near. It was perhaps
his style in this book that led the writer
of his memoir in the Times to say that
his conversation was less epigrammatic
than his writings. He did not strive at
epigram, and his presence and influence
irradiated the society in which he moved
rather with a diffused and steady efful-
gence than with brilliant but evanescent
flashes. This is probably spoken of the
later days, in which he had fallen rather
silent, the effervescence of youth being
quieted and the meditative habit grown
strong; but it is a very questionable
choice of words to call anything he ever
wrote epigrammatic. We are so accus-
tomed to dull writers that when we find
any vivid significance in what we read,
we are apt to attribute it to some trick or
turn in the way the thing is put. Maines
sentences, in Popular Government, as
well as elsewhere and upon less lively
themes, break with no sudden light, but
are radiant, rather, from end to end,
burning steadily and without flash. We
see the whole page irradiated, find point
in every sentence, and say, out of habit,
that it is epigrammatic. But no one sen-
tence carries the meaning; it is spread
upon the whole page.
	Honors came thick and fast upon
Maine after his return from India. In
the spring of 1871, the year in which he
accepted a seat in the council at the
India Office, he was gazetted Knight
Commander of the Star of India, and
was henceforth Sir Henry Maine. In
1877 he was chosen Master of Trinity
Hall, Cambridge,  the college in which,
thirty years before, he had coached
youngsters in the best dodges in trans-
lation, and had delighted a select circle
of friends with his luminous talk,  and
he of course gave up the Corpus Profes-
sorship at Oxford to accept it. He still
kept his seat and sedulously attended to
his work at the council board of the
India Office, and continued to reside in
London; but he made himself felt at
Cambridge none the less, and let no one
feel that he was neglecting the duties or
letting down the social traditions of the
Mastership of Trinity Hall. He was
offered the permanent under-secretary-
ship of the Home Office in 1885, and in
1886 the chief clerkship of the House
of Commons, to succeed Sir Thomas
Erskine May. No doubt, as one of his
friends has suggested, it was well under-
stood that Sir Henry would himself know
whether he was fitted for these offices,
and could be relied upon to decline them
if he was not. He accepted, in 1887,
the Whewell Professorship of Inter-
national Law at Cambridge, but just
made vacant by the retirement of Sir
William Harcourt, and in the same year
delivered those lectures on disputed ques-
tions of international obligation and
practice now preserved in a thin volume
which we should be very loath to miss
from our shelves. It is said that before
going to India, in 1862, he had pro-
jected, and to a great extent prepared, a
work on International Law, intended as
a companion to his Ancient Law, and
	conceived in the same spirit, but that
when he returned from India the manu-
script of this work could not be found,
and was never recovered. Like the true
scholar lie was, he took the loss very
cheerfully, assured that what he could</PB>

write upon the subject now would be
much more full-bodied and much more
abreast of the best scholarship than what
he had written then; but alas! he was
not to do the work he had projected, af-
ter all. He died suddenly, of apoplexy,
February 3, 1888, at Cannes, whither he
had gone, alone, expecting to recuperate,
not looking for the end; and we have
only his first lectures, unrevised. They
are singularly finished in tone, manner,
and substance, like everything he wrote,
but they are only a fragment of what he
meant to do.
	His friends thought, when he was
gone, not of the great writer whom the
world had lost, but of the genial, sweet-
spirited, enlightened gentleman who
would never again make their gatherings
bright with his presence. The general
world of society and of affairs had never
known Sir Henry Maine. He gave the
best energies of his life to public duty,
 to the administration of India; but
he rendered his service at quiet council
boards, whose debates were of business,
not of questions of politics, and did not
find their way into the public prints.
He had no taste for publicity; preferred
the secluded groups that gathered about
him in the little hall of Corpus Christi
to any assembly of the people. He did
not have strong popular sympathies, in-
deed, and disdained to attempt the gen-
eral ear. He loved knowledge, and was
indifferent to opinion. It perhaps went
along with his delicate physique and
sensitive temperament that he should
shrink from crowds and distrust the
populace. His quickness of apprehen-
sion, power of expression, and luminous
intuition, the writer in the Saturday
Review tells us, would perhaps have led
an uninformed observer to the conclu-
sion that their possessor had the tem-
perament of a poetical enthusiast. But
no greater mistake, he declares,
could have been made. They were as-
sociated with a temperament which was
liable to err on the side of caution, re-
gard to actual circumstances, and a total
absence of any sort of enthusiasm or illu-
sion. And certainly no man who is with-
out any sort of enthusiasm or illusion
can easily be a democrat or a politician;
for he will take democracy in the ab-
stract, as Maine did, instead of taking it
practically and in the bulk, and will lack
that serviceable confidence in good aver-
age sense and sober second thought on
the part of the people, which leaders
have and are justified in having among
a self-possessed populace accustomed to
the drill and orderly action of self-gov-
ernment. But immediate leadership was
not Maines function. It was his suit-
able part in the world to clarify know-
ledge, to show it in its large proportions
and long significance to those who could
see. His mind was an exquisitely tem-
pered instrument of judgment and inter-
pretation. It touched knowledge with
a revealing, almost with a creative, pow-
er, and as if the large relationships of
fact and principle were to it the simple
first elements of knowledge. He thought
always so like a seer, moved always in
so serene an air! His world seemed to
be kept always clear of mists and clouds,
as if it were blown through with steady
trade-winds, which brought with them
not only pure airs, but also the harmoni-
ous sounds and the abiding fragrance of
the great round world.

SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES.

	IT is my intention to give some idea
of the man himself, and of his early
formative influences, rather than to at-
tempt a critical estimate of his work.
Of the man, I may say at once that he
was a prince among his fellows. In no-
bility of nature, in sweetness and charm
of tempcrament, in distinction of sen-
titnent, in his spiritual outlook, tender,
strong, earnest, with an exquisite kindly
humor, he won the love as well as the
admiration of all who knew him. He
had a life so uneventful in external vi-
cissitudes that its main features may be
told in a few words. What is there to
say, he exclaimed once of a great man
who had suddenly passed from among
us, what is there to say beyond this, 
that between youth and old age he ever
failed nobly, or nobly succeeded? No-
thing else is called for. His work is
his commentary on life, his biography,
his record of spiritual adventure. As
for the private individual, he and those
dear to him are entitled to look upon the
privacies of his intimate life as not only
sacred, but as having absolutely no con-
cern with the public curiosity.
	Of Edward Burne-Jones this is cer-
tainly true,  that his work is his spirit-
ual biography; nor could any one who
had the privilege of his friendly regard
violate wishes so often and emphatically
expressed. But, as a matter of fact, he
need not have feared those rents in the
privacy of his intimate life which death
so often discloses. There were none to
be revealed.
	I have been happy in my life, I
have heard him say, happy in my
friendships, happy in my art; and the
only unhappiness I have known, apart
from those sorrows which we all have in
common, is the unhappiness of that spirit
witbin one which is forever haunted by
the discrepancy between the dream, the
vision, and the possible, and therefore
far less the ideal, accomplishment.
	There could be few greater contrasts
than between the presumptive Barne-
Jones, as he was fashioned after the pub-
lic fancy, and the Burne-Jones of reality.
Partly because of the dreamlike beauty
and remoteness of most of his work, part-
ly because he was seldom seen in public
or at social gatherings, and partly because
he was known to be a recluse who was
never so happy as when in his studio in
a quiet region of remoter Kensington,
the idea had developed into a common
belief that as a man he was a mere
dreamer, wholly preoccupied with poetic
and symbolical vision, and in his individ-
ual outlook as remote from his fellows
as in the imaginative expression of his
spiritual ideas he was, remote from the
sterile actualities of the commonplace.
	This popular view was as baseless as
that which regarded William Morris, be-
cause he was the author of The Earthly
Paradise and Love is Enough, as the
idle dreamer of an empty day. The two
friends were in every sense of the word
men of the hour as well as of their day,
and of that larger day wherein the great
and noble endure.

distinguished Welshman. There is too
much license in this designation. He
was born in England, of parents them-
selves born and bred in England; and

ancestors were of Cymric stock, there
seems to be no absolute surety.

SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES.

	IT is my intention to give some idea
of the man himself, and of his early

tempt a critical estimate of his work.
Of the man, I may say at once that he

that life, have been, and are, in no small
degree, either Celtic or foreign to the
Anglo-Saxon. He always maintained
that William Morris and iRossetti had
done far more to influence the develop-
ment of the true spirit of art, howsoever
expressed, than Tennyson or Browning.
When a friend pointed out to him that
Morris, though by birth and blood a
Welshman, was English of the English, he
would rebut the assertion with humorous
emphasis, declaring that he was only
one of the Welsh Morrises who had con-
quered England; and that if he was nt
that, he was certainly a Scandinavian vi-
king who had unexpectedly cropped up
among the much enduring Saxons. Mor-
ris used to laugh, and exclaim, Paint s
the thing, Ned, after all! Whereat his
friend would suddenly desert the whole
question in eager agreement, though be-
fore parting he might shoot a Parthian
shaft in the guise of But after all,
Topsy, you are a viking, and you know
it! In other words, he took the wider
view. Nationality, I heard him say
on one occasion, is an endless snare in
art. It s all mere accident. The only
inevitable thing, independent of race,
time, or circumstance, though of course
influenced by these, is genius.
	It may be as well to add that Celtic
sympathies took practical expression in
his keen understanding of and eager
wish to be in line with Irish, Welsh, and
Scottish nationalist aspirations. Charles
Stuart Parnell had no stancher adherent
in England, and Gladstone had no more
eager follower in his dream of a late
retribution to unfortunate Ireland, than
this painter of other-worldism.
	It was on August 28, 1833, and in
a Birmingham very different from the
Birmingham of to - day, that Edward
Coley Burne Jones was born. I do not
know what authority there is for the
statement which I have frequently heard,
though I have never seen it in print, 
which I first heard, indeed, some seven-
teen or eighteen years ago, from Rossetti,
 that the third baptismal name was not
Burne, but Bryn. It may or may not
be true, also, that it was Rossetti who
urged him, at the outset of his career,
to drop the Coley, and connect with
a hyphen Burne and Jones.
Jones is nobody, Rossetti would de-
clare,  only a particle of a vast mul-
tiple! But Burne-Jones,  that is un-
mistakable! It was an amusing trait
in iRossetti that lie was wont to de-
signate the good work of this or that
friend as the work of  and lie would
mention the most distinctive name or
part name of the person concerned.
Thus he would say, Yes, that is Burne-
Jones, but this, this here, you know, is
only Jones; or, That, now, is the real
Holman Hunt, but this here is only
Hunt; or, You can hear Tennyson in
that, but Alfred wrote the other lines.
	I recall two amusing instances where
Burne-Jones more or less unconscious-
ly adopted the same method. He was
asked once if he thought William Bell
Scott more eminent as a poet or as an
artist. I never thought very highly of
Bell, he said; then, seeing a look of sur-
prise, added, with a humorous twinkle,
I liked old Bell Scott  old Scotus, as
we always called him  immensely, and
I think William Bell Scott wrote some
very fine verse; but I always thought it
was a pity that Bell took to painting!
The other instance occurred when some
one remarked to him that Parnell was
only an agitator. Charles Stuart Par-
nell, he replied, with emphasis, was
one of the greatest public men of our
day, and far and away the ablest Irish
leader. But Parnehl, resumed the
objector; to be again corrected by the
other disputant, Charles Stuart Par-
nell.
	On the other hand, Rossetti rarely, if
ever, called his friend Burne Jones in
intimate life or intimate correspondence.
He was always Jones or Ned Jones.
Perhaps Ned Jones was the man; Jones,
the friend who painted; Burne Jones,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00383" SEQ="0383" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="377">Sir Edward Burne-Jones.

the man of genius. And as with Ros-
setti, so was it with other early friends of
the artist. Burne Jones was oniy a dis-
tinctive name for the benefit of outsiders.
Although the name is now generally
hyphened, I do not think that its owner
ever wrote it so himself. In any case,
long before he became Sir Edward he
had ceased to call himself anything other
than Burne Jones, as though that were
his single surname.
	His father, Richard Edward Jones,
who married Miss Elizabeth Coley,
was in business in Birmingham; and it
was a dull environment into which his
only son was born, for the Birmingham
of the early Victorian era was an un-
lovely place; but the lads childhood
and early boyhood were undisturbed by
bitter dreams of the beautiful unattain-
able, for the good reason that he was
brought up in complete ignorance of
such a factor in life as Art. As I have
heard Sir Edward declare, his early
boyhood was perturbed only on the in-
tellectual side. He had a great desire
for knowledge, for mental adventure
and excitement,  a desire continuously
starved in his home circle, and for long
thwarted by circumstances. My ideal,
like that of thousands of other boys,
he was wont to add, was to be a pi-
rate; but at the back of that craving
was, I think, the mere desire to raid
the bookshops, and carry off all the sto-
ries of adventure, and stirring histories
of what boys who had become men had
achieved,  with, perhaps, as a tapestry
background to that, again, a vision of an
ideal world of romance, situate nowhere,
perhaps, with certainty, but quite cer-
tainly beyond the confines of Birming-
ham.
	In childhood, his mental need was
sustained, so far as lie could remember,
by the Pilgrims Progress, the Book
of Martyrs, and Sandford and Merton.
No Robinson Crusoe, not even a Swiss
Family Robinson, cheered his evenings.
I think, he said once, with a twinkle
in his eyes, I must have been a very
healthy child; for when I was nt eating
I was sleeping. Perhaps sometimes I
pretended to be sleepy.
	If I had not become a painter, as-
suredly I should have become a book-
worm, he said, on an occasion when an
eminent Oxford professor was express-
ing gratified surprise at the discovery
that the man whom he so much admired
as a painter was also a scholar, and not
only a classical scholar and an eager stu-
dent of the literature of all ages, but a
scholar in the difficult science of philolo-
gy. It was, if I remember right, at the
time when Sir Edward was painting the
last of the Briar Rose series. Of the two
visitors to his studio, one was Mr. Glad-
stone. The great statesman quoted two
lines in Greek, to the effect that he too
was caught in the maze; when Sir Ed-
ward at once responded with another
Greek couplet, the drift of which was that,
deep as the maze was, Theseus found his
way therefrom the moment he found the
clue. In this quotation occurred a very
archaic word, which at once arrested
the attention of the eminent Oxonian.
Yes, returned the painter, that is a
far-traveled word. It came to Greece
from beyond the Himalayas; it so-
journed in Carthage, and had a long
residence in Rome; it may now be found
at any moment in any of the Latin
tongues; the Welsh and Irish Celts use
it, and in all probability it is known to
the Finn and the Basque. It may be
of general interest to add that two fa..-
mous critics have expressed themselves
emphatically as to the intellectual pow-
ers of the painter, apart from his art:
Mr. Ruskin, who many years ago spoke
of him as the most cultured artist whom
he had ever known,  and it must be re-
membered that he was acquainted with
Rossetti, G. F. Watts, and Holman
Hunt; and James Russell Lowell, who
declared that, apart from his eminence
as a painter, Edward Burne-Jones was
in every sense of the word a great man.</PB>

	It is pleasant to think that what
he lacked so much in his own childhood
was given with royal largesse to his
children. There could be few more for-
tunate childhoods than those of Philip
and Margaret Burne-Jones. They had
not only beautiful things about them,
with the far more important spirit of
beauty permeating their lives, and books
of the kind to fascinate and stimulate
imaginative children, but a father who
took keen delight in amusing them with
fantastic and often charming drawings,
mostly of a humorous nature. There
are, probably, very few of those nur-
sery drawings now remaining, but those
which I have seen are delightful in
their humor and gay insouciance. At
all times, Burne - Jones found pleasure
in amusing his friends with grotesque
sketches, skits of friends, acquaintances,
and others, and humorous commentaries
on topical events. It has been said of
him that he might have been a great
caricaturist, and, again, a great black-
and-white artist, if he had not chosen
the better part, and been true to the
best that was in him to do. In his own
words, written when he was in the early
twenties, our work, whatsoever it be,
must be the best of its kind, the noblest
we can offer. This absolute public
severance from his work of all that was
not on the same high level of aim has
led many people to suppose that he
lacked the sense of humor, and that he
was, in a word, though so unconvention-
al according to the academic standard,
a slave to his own convention. This
common accusation, however, generally
comes, not from a keen sense of the value
of humor, as might be supposed, but from
a lack of the sense of art.
	When Edward was about ten years
old, his father thought of ultimately ap-
prenticing him to a trade, or of getting
him into some mercantile house. Hap-
pily for art, he decided, when his son
was eleven, to send him to a good train-
ing school, in order that eventually he
might enter the Church. Fortunately,
one of the best schools in the kingdom
existed in Birmingham, King Edwards
School, an ancient foundation established
by King Edward in 1522. It was not
a leap into the dark; it was a leap into
the light. In these words the painter
himself was wont to allude to that mo-
mentous change in his life. Once he
said to me: Broadly speaking, the three
determining factors in my life were,
first, my fathers decision to send me to
King Edwards School and to Oxford;
second, my early meeting and lifelong
friendship with William Morris, and the
influence upon me, both as man and
artist, of Rossetti; and third, my relin-
quishing the idea of entering the minis-
try, and the definite adoption of art as
my sole and inevitable vocation.
	From the first young Burne - Jones
proved himself an eager pupil. The
head of King Edwards School, at that
time, was a very remarkable man, Dr.
Prince Lee, afterward to become distin-
guished as the Bishop of Manchester;
and his intellectual enthusiasm and lofty
ideals further enhanced the high quali-
ties of those assistants whom he had ob-
tained for the school. Any boy who
showed eager aptitude was encouraged
and helped to the utmost. Again and
again the famous painter declared that
he owed an almost incalculable debt to
King Edwards. I might say, he re-
marked to me once, I swam right into
that deep, wonderful sea of Greek lit-
erature and pagan mythology; and just
as I have never forgotten my first visit
to France, which gave me a sense of the
poetry of background, or my first visit
to Siena, where I found my spiritual
ancestry in art, so I never can forget
my introduction to the beautiful pagan
mythology and lovely legends and lit-
erature of Greece.
	In 1852, when he was in his nine-
teenth year, he won an Exhibition at
Exeter College, Oxford. The impres-
sion made upon him by the ancient city</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00385" SEQ="0385" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="379">	Sir Edward Burne-Jones.	379

from the very beginning was inefface-
able. But a stranger and more memo-
rable event happened just at that time;
for on the day that Edward Burne-Jones
went up to Exeter College another young
man entered it, and with the same intent
of taking orders,  a young man named
William Morris. The two undergradu-
ates became friends at once,  a friend-
ship of supreme value to both, and to
Burne-Jones in particular of iucalculable
importance. From that day till the death
of William Morris the friendship grew
in strength and beauty; and when, in
1896, Morris died, the surviving friend
felt that he had sustained a loss which
no lapse of time could ever set right for
him. Sir Edward was never quite him-
self afterward. Especially did he miss
Morris on Sunday mornings, because for
many years it had been their wont to
breakfast together and to talk over inti-
mately all that so dearly concerned both.
It is more than possible that the color-
gloom and sombre sentiment pervading
the work of Sir Edward Burne-Jones
for the last year or two was due more
or less directly and paramountly to the
loss of his lifelong friend and comrade.
	There was one personal subject on
which William Morris, on his side, could
always talk with enthusiasm, and that
was his friend Ned Jones. I remem-
ber that one day, when I was walking
with him from Hyde Park Corner west-
ward, near Sloane Street we met an ac-
quaintance, who said he had just heard
that Burne-Jones had died suddenly at
Rottingdean.1 The report had arisen
through the misapprehension of a local
Brighton reporter, who had heard of the
death of a Mr. Penrhyn Jones. But,
at the announcement, I thought Morris
had received some mortal hurt. His
whole expression changed: he seemed
ten years older, and his eyes had a look
in them I shall never forget. I dont
	1 Some years ago Sir Edward Burne-Jones
made a change and rest home at Rotting-
dean, on the Sussex coast, near Brighton. Of
believe it, he blurted out at last. I 11
be damned if I believe it! It s out of
the question, I tell you! Then, with
an impatient gesture, he flung aside, with
that strangely sea-captain-like turn he
had, and crossed the road to a post-office,
where he telegraphed to his friend. He
soon had a reply which gave him infinite
relief.
	If Morris never tired of talking of
his friend as he was in the early days,
Burne-Jones never tired of talking of
these memorable undergraduate days
with Morris. The friendship then formed
was doubly welcome to each from the
disappointment both felt, but Burne-
Jones in particular, at the mental apathy
and spiritual sluggardliness of those in
authority,  characteristics shared by
the great majority of the undergradu-
ates.
	It seems to have been Morris who first
definitely relinquished the idea of taking
orders. He thought of becoming an
architect, a painter, and already he had
begun to write verse. For a while his
friend thought of the pursuit of letters.
However, in a relatively brief time both
fell under the same spell, and life sud-
denly revealed definite vistas. Three
names were already well known in the
small art-loving world of Oxford: these
were Millais, Holman Hunt, and Dante
Gabriel Rossetti.
	One day Morris and I discovered that
we were face to face with something new
and wonderful. It was the opening of
the first seal for each of us. It was
Rossetti, the poet who was so new and
strange a painter, and the painter who
wrote poetry with so rare and strange
a new note, who appealed to us most,
who influenced us most; but we felt the
charm, the originality, the novel crea-
tive spirit, of each of these men; and,
perhaps more than all, the spirit com-
mon to them all,  in them, but yet be-
late years he had his nephew-in-law, Mr. Rud-
yard Kipling, as his neighbor.</PB>

yond them,  the wonderful, fresh, re-
creative spirit of a new day. Thus I
have heard Edward Burne-Jones speak,
and, to the same effect, William Mor-
ris.
	It is not generally known that the
artist made his first public appearance
as an author. In that exceedingly rare
periodical, The Oxford and Cambridge
Magazine of 1856 (twelve parts only
were issued), there are two papers mainly
on Thackeray, in the January and June
numbers. These (and, as I was told by
Rossetti, also the interesting article on
Ruskins third volume of Modern Paint-
ers) were written by Edward Burne-
Jones. The few who know that he did
write one literary essay have taken it
for granted that the paper on The New-
comes alone was his; but the second
was only the leave-over from the first.
In this magazine, each monthly part of
which is now literally worth its weight
in gold, appeared three of the lovely
archaic stories of William Morris and
several of his poems, and, of Rossettis,
The Blessed Damozel (second lection),
The Burden of Nineveh, and The Staff
and Scrip. All the contributions were
unsigned.
	For The Story of Chiaro, which Ros-
setti entitled Hand and Soul, Burne-
Jones had always the most profound
admiration. A short time after Rosset-
tis death he thought of painting one or
more pictures illustrative of The Story
of Chiaro, but, so far as I am aware,
he never did so. I recollect that, not
long subsequent to the death of Wil-
liam Morris, Sir Edward spoke to me
about the extraordinary impression Hand
and Soul had made upon Morris and
himself, when they first read it, which
memorable event occurred one afternoon
by Isis side, William Morris being the
reader. We were both so overcome
that we could not speak a word about
it. It was on this occasion, too, that
the painter told me he had never yet
fulfilled an almost lifelong intention, 
namely, to paint a picture of the Death
of Gertha.
	No other of William Morriss early
writings had so great a fascination for
him as the beautiful romantic tale Ger-
thas Lovers, which his friend had writ-
ten in his company, under the willows
by the riverside. I asked him what
particular scene or event he had wished
to make the subject of his picture, and
he replied: The opening and the clos-
ing sentences always invited me in an
indescribable way, but the motive par
excellence was that of Gertha after death,
in the chapter entitled What Edith the
Handmaiden saw from the War-Saddle,
where the beautiful queen lies on the
battlefield with the blue speedwell about
her pale face, while a soft wind rustles
the sunset-lit aspens overhead.
Here is the passage alluded to : 
So there lay down Gertha, and the
blue speedwell kissed her white cheek;
there her breath left her, and she lay
very still, while the wind passed over
her now and then, with hands laid across
her breast. [And there Edith her hand-
maiden found her] lying dead among
the flowers, with her hands crossed over
her breast, and a soft wind that caine
from the place where the sun had set
shook the aspen leaves.
	Yes, I must paint Gertha before I
die, lie added, and the more so now
that dear Morris is gone. It will be like
living over my youth, our youth, again.
	The writings of Ruskin, the strange
new poetry and the strange new roman-
tic art of Rossetti, the pictorial intensity
and symbolism of Holman Hunt, were
perhaps the chief causes which brought
about that vital change in the life of
Burne - Jomics and of Wihliani Morris
which resulted in their giving up the
idea of entering the Church. But there
were other personal influences of mo-
mnent. There was, too, time spirit of change
in the, air,  the spirit of a new era,
of a deep and potent renaissance. Rus-
kin, Carlyle, Thackeray,  these great</PB>

ones, each in his own way, had already
exercised an extraordinary influence
upon the keenest spirits of the new gen-
eration. Charles Kingsley and others
wrought to the same end. The world
of art had awakened, and was full of
rumors. A vast wave of resentment,
almost of hostility, had begun to rise
against this new, unexpected tide. It
was a day of revolution.
	Long before the two friends left Ox-
ford they had discovered that they too
were of those who had the shaping and
making powers. The discovery was an
intoxication to them, and from that mo-
ment their development was so rapid as
to surprise both themselves and their
friends. Morris was now almost cease-
lessly preoccupied with both pen and
pencil; for, like iRossetti, he had from
the first a dual genius, as poet and
painter. Burne-Jones hardly let pass a
day in which, with swift if unregulated
technical advance, he did not find some
expression in romantic pen - and - ink
designs of remarkable richness and
quality, as Mr. William Rossetti has
recorded.
	I am not sure whether it was before
he left Oxford that Burne-Jones made
another friendship, destined to be one
of the three most noteworthy in his life,
 the friendship of Mr. Swinburne.
This great poet won the love and admi-
ration of all that brilliant band whose
work was to bring about a revolution in
the art and literature of their country,
and among those whose genius he at once
recognized was the young painter. He
already knew Rossetti, Morris, and others
of only less wonderful power and pro-
mise; but it was to the still relatively
unknown artist that, in 1866, he dedi-
cated his Poems and Ballads affection-
ately and admiringly.
	Mr. Swinburne made Rossettis ac-
quaintance in 1857, while the painter
was busy upon his fresco work in the
Union at Oxford. In Rossettis own
words, it was his first meeting with
immediately convincing and unmistak-
able genius. The meeting, in its after
results, was a memorable one for the
four greatest among these  new ~
	IRossetti, Swinburne, William Morris,
and Burne-Jones.
	When, toward the end of 1855, Burne-
Jones left Oxford for London, he had
one great wish,  to see Dante Gabriel
Rossetti, already his accepted leader,
the pioneer. Modest and distrustful of
his own powers, he did not think of
seeking an interview with the poet-paint-
er, but hoped to be able to obtain at
least a glimpse, to see the face and hear
the voice of the man who had so pro-
foundly influenced him. The meeting
took place at one of the evening classes
for drawing at the College for Working
Men, in Great Titchfleld Street, where,
the eager aspirant had heard, Rossetti
gave instruction in design on certain
evenings each week.
	The young artist not only won the
friendship of Rossetti, but was encour-
aged to devote himself wholly and en-
thusiastically to art. An instance of his
rapid development, and at the same time
of Rossettis magnanimity, is afforded in
an interesting anecdote, long familiar in
the circle: that when Rossetti went
to see how his young friend was getting
on, and asked for the drawings of his
own which he had lent him, he was so
much impressed by the excellence of the
work of his disciple that he tore up his
sketches, remarking, You have no more
to learn from these.
	It was Rossetti, too, who transformed
Burne-Joness vague dream of an ulti-
mate art career into actuality. He had
already made up his mind not to enter
the Church, but he had still his degree
to take and another half-year to spend
at Oxford; and then, too, there was the
keen disappointment of his father to
reckon with. Carlyle with his gospel of
work, Ruskin with his gospel of spiritual
duty, Rossetti with his gospel of beauty,
were not his masters for nothing. He</PB>

did as they would have done, and the
outcome was his splendid justification.
	Naturally, Rossetti being the generous
and magnanimous man he was, he did
everything he could to help the new-
comer. It was he who was instrumental
in procuring Burne-Joness first commis-
sion in a branch of art that he after-
ward made peculiarly his own; for on
the advice of the elder man one Mr.
Powell entrusted to the young artist a
commission for stained-glass windows.
His friend also introduced him to Mr.
Ruskin, who in time became a helpful
patron as well as an ardent admirer of
his work.
	Burne-Jones painted mostly in water-
colors till about 1868, when in the beau-
tiful Chant dAmour he made a new
departure. In 185859 he painted in
tempera his first Arthurian subject, that
of Merlin and Nimue. Some of his
drawings of this period are wonderful
for their beauty and originality, notably
the Sidonia the Sorceress drawings. Be-
tween 1858 and 1868 he painted some
of his loveliest work in water-color: The
Annunciation, Summer Snow, Cupids
Forge, Blind Love, King Ren6s Honey-
moon, Theseus and Ariadne, Laus Ye-
neris (186178), Tristram and Yseult,
The Enchantments of Nimue, Fatima,
Morgan le Fay, The Merciful Knight,
The Wine of Circe, Le Chant dAmour
(1865, first version), Chaucers Dream,
Cupid and Psyche, Astrologia, St. The-
ophilus and the Angel, and others. In
1866 he painted a St. George and the
Dragon in oils, in 1868 Green Summer,
and in the same year, a few months ear-
lier, began the (small) Mirror of Venus,
which, however, was not finished till
1877.
	In this period, also, he achieved much
lovely work in cartoons for stained-
glass windows, beginning in 1857 with
Adam and Eve, The Tower of Babel,
and King Solomon and the Queen of
Sheba, for St. Andrews College, Brad-
field, Berks. In extent, in beauty, in
endless imaginative fecundity, Burne-
Joness work in this branch is something
to marvel at. From 1857 till 1897 he
never ceased to work at these cartoons,
and in those forty years he added more
beauty to the churches, colleges, and
public buildings of Great Britain than
any other English artist, of any time or
period, has done.
	It was in 1868 that he began often-
er to paint his pictures in oil, though he
was always preeminently fond of water-
color as a medium, and practiced it till
the end. With the large oil picture of
Le Chant dAmour (begun in 1868, and
finished in 1877) what a superb series
of masterpieces is inaugurated! Pyg-
malion and the Image, The Hours, the
first small Briar Rose series of three,
Pan and Psyche, The Beguiling of Mer-
lin, the noble Feast of Peleus, The Mir-
ror of Venus, Laus Veneris (187378),
Hero, Dana~, The Golden Stairs, For-
tune, King Cophetna and the Beggar
Maid, Perseus and the Grake, The Briar
Wood (188490), The Depths of the
Sea, Flamma Vestalis, The Garden of
Pan, Dana~ and the Brazen Tower, The
Heart of the Rose, and so forth.
	In water - color (mostly on a large
scale) he achieved, in the last thirty
years of his life, some of the most beau-
tiful work ever painted in England:
such, for instance, as The Hesperides,
The Heart Desires (Pygmalion), Love
among the Ruins, Fortune, Fame, Ob-
livion, Love, Summer, The Sleeping
Beauty, the Angels of Creation, Pyra-
mus and Thisbe, The Bath of Venus,
Dies Domini, The Star of Bethlehem.
From the wonderful little drawing of
1856, The Waxen Image, to The Briar
Rose and the work of the last few years,
what a record! No man in our time
has given himself more wholly, more
whole-heartedly, to the quest of beauty.
	At the time of The Waxen Image
drawing he shared rooms at 17 Red
Lion Square with William Morris, and
it was to this companionship he, owed</PB>

his lifelong devotion to Chaucer, so often
the source of his finest inspiration.
	The next great influence in his life
was a visit to Italy which he made in
the autumn of 1859. He came back
profoundly impressed by what he had
seen in Pisa, Florence, and Siena; in-
deed, for the noble and dignified art of
the great Sienese he conceived then,
and ever maintained, a supreme admira-
tion. A second visit, in the company of
Mr. iRuskin, was made in the summer
of 1862, and this time he went to Venice.
Here Burne-Jones discovered that his
truest powers lay, not in the direction of
Venetian splendor, but in that of the
dignity, the austerity, the lofty spiritual
aristocracy of the art of Siena. From
Venice he wrote to Rossetti a letter with
an interesting note in it: The other
day I saw a letter of Titians. The
handwriting was, absolutely, exactly like
yours,  as like as a forged letter of
yours could be; the whole writing a lit-
tle bit bigger, I think, but the shapes of
the letters as exact as could be.
	On his first return from Italy, Burne-
Jones settled in rooms near Fitzroy
Square, at the corner of Howland Street;
and in 1861 he went to Great Russell
Street, where his first public honor came
to him in 1863, with his election to an
associateship of the Royal Society of
Painters in Water Colours. In 1865
he moved again to a charming old house
in Kensington Square, and in the au-
tumn paid a long painting visit to
Morris, who was then settled at The
Red House, which he had built for him-
self at Bexley Heath, in Kent. It was
in 1867 that be moved finally to the
quietly situated and fascinating old house
and garden in West Kensington, The
Grange, which was his home ever after,
and where he died. At The Grange,
and at his country or seaside home at
Rottingdean, he spent the happiest years
of his life.
	Not long after his friend Rossetti had
married the beautiful Miss Siddal, and
his comrade William Morris had mar-
ried the still more beautiful Miss Bur-
den, he was himself wedded to a lady
of great distinction and charm, Miss
Georgina Macdonald. One of this ladys
sisters is now Lady Poynter, wife of the
director of the National Gallery, and
another is the mother of Mr. Rudyard
Kipling.
	Of the two children of a very happy
marriage, one, Margaret (whose lovely
portrait is familiar to all admirers of her
fathers art), is now Mrs. Mackail, the
wife of a distinguished scholar and man
of letters; and the other, Philip, now
Sir Philip, is a painter who has won re-
pute for himself, handicapped though he
was by the great name of his father.
	From the time of his marriage Burne-
Joness career is a record of unbroken
success, though for many years against a
public sentiment of hostility or ignorant
amusement,  a sentiment fed by igno-
rant and bigoted critics. It was not till
the establishment of the Grosvenor Gal-
lery, in 1877, that he suddenly, though
amid a still prevalent disparngement, be-
came recognized as one of the great-
est of English artists. The story of his
work and triumphs is a stirring one. He
won happiness, fame, and all the honors
he could care for; he achieved an al-
most unparalleled success; from first to
last he never pandered to any low tastes
or unworthy demands, but was ever true
to his own ideals; he enjoyed the friend-
ship and sympathy of the greatest men
of his time; and he died suddenly, in
the midst of his work, leaving behind
him a great and unsullied name, and a
fame which we may confidently trust the
future to estimate aright.

	As I have already remarked, we were
going from England to Gibraltar to ob-
serve the total eclipse of the sun. A
large party of English astronomers were
going to Algeria for the same purpose.
The government had fitted up a naval
transport for their use, and as I was ar-
ranging for a passage on a P. &#38; 0. ship
we received a cordial invitation to be-
come the guests of the English party.
Among those on board were Professor
Tyndall; Mr. Huggins, the spectroscopist;
Sir Erastus Oininaney, a retired English
admiral, and a Fellow of the Royal So-
ciety; Father Perry, a well-known as-
tronomer; and Lieutenant Wharton, who
afterward became hydrographer to the
Admiralty.
	The sprightliest man on board was Pro-
fessor Tyndall. He made up for the ab-
sence of mountains by climbing to every
part of the ship he could reach. One
day he climbed the shrouds to the main-
top, and stood surveying the scene as if
he fancied himself on top of the Matter-
horn. A sailor followed him, and drew
a chalk-line around his feet. I assume
the reader knows what this means; if he
does not, he can learn by straying into
the sailors quarters the first tune he is on
board an ocean steamer. But the pro-
fessor absolutely refused to take the hint.
	We had a rather rough passage, from
which Father Perry was the greatest
sufferer. One day he heard a laugh from
the only lady on board, who was in the
adjoining stateroom. Who can laugh at
such a time as this! he exclaimed. He
made a vow that he would never go on
the ocean again, even if the sun and moon
fought for a month. But the vows of
a seasick passenger are forgotten sooner
than any others I know of; and it was
only four years later that Father Perry
made a voyage to Kerguelen Island, in
the stormiest ocean on the globe, to ob-
serve a transit of Venus.
	Off the coast of Spain, the leading-
chains of the rudder got loose, during a
gale in the middle of the night, and the
steering apparatus had to be disconnect-
ed in order to tighten them. The ship
veered round into the trough of the sea,
and rolled so heavily that a table, twenty
or thirty feet long, in the saloon, broke
from its fastenings, and began to dance
around the cabin with such a racket that
some of the passengers feared for the
safety of the ship. Just how much of
a storm there was I cannot say, believing
that it is never worth while for a pas-
senger to leave his berth, if there is any
danger of a ship foundering in a gale.
But in Professor Tyndalls opinion we
had a narrow escape. On arriving at
Gibraltar, he wrote a glowing account of
the storm to the London Times, in which
he described the feelings of a philosopher
while standing on the stern of a rolling
ship in an ocean storm, without quite
knowing whether she was going to sink
or swim. The letter was anonymous,
which gave Admiral Ommaney an ex-
cellent opportunity to write as caustic a
reply as he chose, under the signature
of A Naval Officer. He said that
sailor was fortunate who could arrange
with the clerk of the weather never to
have a worse storm in crossing the Bay
of Biscay than the one we had experi-
enced.
	We touched at Cadiz, and anchored
for a few hours, but did not go ashore.
The Brooklyn, an American man-of-
war, was in the harbor, but there was
no opportunity to communicate with her,
though I knew a friend of mine was on
board.

	The sprightliest man on board was Pro-
fessor Tyndall. He made up for the ab-
sence of mountains by climbing to every
part of the ship he could reach. One
day he climbed the shrouds to the main-
top, and stood surveying the scene as if
he fancied himself on top of the Matter-
horn. A sailor followed him, and drew
a chalk-line around his feet. I assume
the reader knows what this means; if he
does not, he can learn by straying into
the sailors quarters the first tune he is on
board an ocean steamer. But the pro-
fessor absolutely refused to take the hint.
	We had a rather rough passage, from
which Father Perry was the greatest
sufferer. One day he heard a laugh from
the only lady on board, who was in the
adjoining stateroom. Who can laugh at
such a time as this! he exclaimed. He
made a vow that he would never go on
the ocean again, even if the sun and moon
fought for a month. But the vows of
a seasick passenger are forgotten sooner
than any others I know of; and it was
only four years later that Father Perry
made a voyage to Kerguelen Island, in
the stormiest ocean on the globe, to ob-
serve a transit of Venus.
	Off the coast of Spain, the leading-
chains of the rudder got loose, during a
gale in the middle of the night, and the
steering apparatus had to be disconnect-
ed in order to tighten them. The ship
veered round into the trough of the sea,
and rolled so heavily that a table, twenty
or thirty feet long, in the saloon, broke
from its fastenings, and began to dance
around the cabin with such a racket that
some of the passengers feared for the
safety of the ship. Just how much of
a storm there was I cannot say, believing
that it is never worth while for a pas-
senger to leave his berth, if there is any
danger of a ship foundering in a gale.
But in Professor Tyndalls opinion we
had a narrow escape. On arriving at
Gibraltar, he wrote a glowing account of
the storm to the London Times, in which
he described the feelings of a philosopher
while standing on the stern of a rolling
ship in an ocean storm, without quite
knowing whether she was going to sink
or swim. The letter was anonymous,
which gave Admiral Ommaney an ex-
cellent opportunity to write as caustic a
reply as he chose, under the signature
of A Naval Officer. He said that
sailor was fortunate who could arrange
with the clerk of the weather never to
have a worse storm in crossing the Bay
of Biscay than the one we had experi-
enced.
	We touched at Cadiz, and anchored
for a few hours, but did not go ashore.
The Brooklyn, an American man-of-
war, was in the harbor, but there was
no opportunity to communicate with her,
though I knew a friend of mine was on
board.
	Gibraltar is the greatest Babel in the
world. I wrote home: The principal</PB>

languages spoken at this hotel are Eng-
lish, Spanish, Moorish, French, Italian,
German, and Danish. I do not know
what languages they speak at the other
hotels. Moorish and Spanish are the
local tongues, and of course English is
the official one; but the traders and com-
mercial travelers speak nearly every lan-
guage one ever heard.
	I hired a Moor  who bore some title
which indicated that he was a descend-
ant of the Caliphs, and by which he had
to be addressed  to do chores and act
as general assistant. One of the first
things I did, the morning after my ar-
rival, was to choose a convenient point
on one of the stone parapets for taking
the sun, in order to test the running
of my chronometer. I had some sus-
picion as to the result, but was willing
to be amused. A sentinel speedily in-
formed me that no sights were allowed
to be taken on the fortification. I told
him I was taking sights on the sun, not
on the fortification. But be was inex-
orable; the rule was that no sights of
any sort could be taken without a per-
mit. Isoon learned from Mr. Sprague,
the American consul, who the proper
officer was to issue the permit, which I
was assured would be granted without
the slightest difficulty.
	The consul presented me to the mili-
tary governor of the place, General Sir
Fenwick Williams of Kars. He was a
man whom it was very interesting to
meet. His heroic defense of the town
whose name was added to his own as a
part of his title was still fresh in mens
minds. It had won him the order of
the Bath in England, the Grand Cross
of the Legion of Honor and a sword
from Napoleon III., and the usual num-
ber of lesser distinctions. The mili-
tary governor, the sole authority and
viceroy of the Queen in the fortress, is
treated with the deference due to an ex-
alted personage; but this deference so
strengthens the dignity of the position
that the holder may be frank and hearty

at his own pleasure, without danger of
impairing it. Certainly, we found Sir
Fenwick a most genial and charming
gentleman. The Alabama claims were
then in their acute stage, and he ex-
pressed the earnest hope that the two
nations would not proceed to cutting
each others throats over theni.
	There was no need of troubling the
governor with such a detail as that of
a permit to take sights; but the consul
ventured to relate my experience of the
morning. He took the information in
a way which showed that England, in
making him a general, had lost a good
diplomatist. Instead of treating the mat-
ter seriously, which would have implied
that we did not fully understand the sit-
uation, he professed to be greatly amused,
and said it reminded him of the case of
an old lady in Punch who had to pass a
surveyor in the street, behind a theodo-
lite. Please, sir, dont shoot till I get
past, she begged.
	Before leaving England, I had made
very elaborate arrangements, both with
the Astronomer Royal and with the tele-
graph companies, to determine the longi-
tude of Gibraltar by telegraphic signals.
The most difficult part of the operation
was the transfer of the signals from the
end of the land line into the cable, which
had to be done by hand, because the cable.
companies were not willing to trust to an
automatic action of any sort between the~
land line and the cable. It was there-
fore necessary to show the operator at
the point of junction how signals were to~
be transmitted. This required a jour-
ney to Port Curno, at the very end of
the Lands end, several miles beyond
the terminus of the railway. It was the
most old-time place I ever saw; one
might have imagined himself thrown.
back into the days of the Lancasters.
The thatched inn had a hard stone floor,
with a layer of loose sand scattered over
it as a carpet in the bedroom. My
linguistic qualities were put to a severe
test in talking with the landlady. But</PB>

The cable operators were pleasing and in-
telligent young gentlemen, and I had no
difficulty in making them understand
how the work was to be done. I have
not seen or heard of them since, but
should any one of them chance to see
these lines, I wish him to know how
pleasantly I remember my visit to his
little station.
	The manager of the cable was Sir
James Anderson, who had formerly com-
manded a Cunard steamship from Bos-
ton, and was well known to the Harvard
professors, with whom he was a favorite.
I had met him, or at least seen him, at
n meeting of the American Academy ten
years before, where he was introduced
by one of his Harvard friends. After
commanding the ship that laid the first
Atlantic cable, he was made manager of
the cable line from England to Gibraltar.
He gave me a letter to the bead opera-
tor at Gibraltar, the celebrated de Sauty.
	I say the celebrated, but may it
not be that this appellation can only sug-
gest the vanity of all human greatness?
It just occurs to me that many of the
present generation may not even have
heard of the

Whispering Boanerges, son of silent thunder,
Holding talk with nations,

immortalized by Holmes in one of his hu-
morously scientific poems. During the
two short weeks that the first Atlantic
cable transmitted its signals, his fame
spread over the land, for the moment ob-
scuring by its brilliancy that of Thom-
son, Field, and all others who had taken
part in designing and laying the cable.
On the breaking down of the cable he
lapsed into his former obscurity. Tasked
him if he had ever seen Holmess produc-
tion. He replied that he had received
a copy of The Atlantic Monthly contain-
hag it from the poet himself, accompanied
by a note saying that he might find in
it something of interest. He had been
overwhelmed with invitations to continue
his journey from Newfoundland to the
United States and lecture on the cable,
but was sensible enough to decline them.
	The rest of the story of the telegraphic
longitude is short. The first news which
de Sauty had to give me was that the
cable was broken,  just where, he did
not know, and would not be able soon to
discover. After the break was located,
an unknown period would be required
to raise the cable, find the place, and
repair the breach. The weather, on the
day of the eclipse, was more than half
cloudy, so that I did not succeed in mak-
ing observations of such value as would
justify my waiting indefinitely for the
repair of the cable, and the project of
determining the longitude had to be
abandoned.
	I had a mission which was vastly more
important than any observation of the
eclipse possibly could be. The question
of the moons motion was then, as it is
now, one of the unsettled ones in math-
ematical astronomy. The British gov-
ernment, in 1857, had published tables of
the moon by Hansen, which were sup-
posed to settle the question, at least for
one or more centuries. But ten years
had not elapsed after the publication be-
fore something was found to be wrong,
and I suspected that, if the facts could
only be brought out, the tables would be
found to have been very largely in error
for times before the beginning of ac-
curate observations in 1750. The most
promising place to search for older obser-
vations was the Paris observatory; but
the Franco-Prussian war made a visit
thither impossible at the moment. So
we determined to pass the winter at Ber-
lin, waiting for the war to close.
	We went by way of Italy. The Medi-
terranean is a charming sea in summer,
but in winter is a good deal like the At-
lantic. The cause of the blueness of its
water is not completely settled; but its
sharing this color with Lake Geneva,
which is tinged with detritus from the
shore, might lead one to ascribe it to
substances held in solution. The color</PB>

is noticeable even in the harbor of Malta,
to which we had a pleasant though not
very smooth passage of five days. Here
was our first experience of an Italian
town of a generation ago. I had no
sooner started to take my first walk than
a so-called guide, who spoke what he
thought was English, got on my track,
and insisted on showing me everything.
If I started toward a shop, he ran in
before me, invited me in, asked what
I would like to buy, and told the shop-
man to show the gentleman something.
I could not get rid of him till Ireturned
to the hotel, and then he had the au-
dacity to want a fee for his services. I
do not think he got it. Everything of
interest was easily seen, and we only
stopped to take the first Italian steamer
to Messina. We touched at Syracuse
and Catania, but did not land.
	A~tna, from the sea, is one of the
grandest sights I ever saw. Its snow-
covered cone seems to rise on all sides
out of the sea or the plain, and to pene-
trate the blue sky. In this it gives an im-
pression like that of the Weisshorn seen
from Randa, but gains by its isolation.
	At Messina, of course, our steamer was
visited by a commissionnaire, who asked
me in good English whether I wanted a
hotel. I told him that I had already
decided upon a hotel, and therefore did
not need his services. But it turned out
that he belonged to the very hotel I was
going to, and was withal an American,
a regular Yankee, in fact, and so obvi-
ously honest that I placed myself un-
reservedly in his hands,  something
which I never did, with one of his pro-
fession, before or since. He said the first
thing was to get our baggage through
the custom - house, which he could do
without any trouble, at the cost of a
franc. He was as good as his word.
The Italian custom - house was marked
by primitive rigor, and baggage was
subjected to a very thorough search.
But my man was evidently well known
and fully trusted. I was asked to raise
the lid of one trunk, which I did; the
official looked at it, with his hands inhis
pockets, gave a nod, and the affair was
over. My Yankee friend collected one
franc for that part of the business. He
told us all about the place, changed our
money so as to take advantage of the
premium on gold, and altogether looked
out for our interests in a way to do honor
to his tribe. I thought there might be
some curious story of the way in which
a New Englander of such qualities could
have got into such a place, but it will
have to be left to imagination.
	We reached the Bay of Naples in the
morning twilight, after making an un-
successful attempt to locate Scylla and
Charybdis. If they ever existed, they
must have disappeared. Vesuvius was
now and then lighting up the clouds
with its intermittent flame. But we had
passed a most uncomfortable night, and
the morning was wet and chilly. A view
requires something more than the objec-
tive to make it appreciated, and the effect
of a rough voyage and bad weather was
such as to deprive of all its beauty what
is considered one of the finest views in the
world. Moreover, the experience made
me so ill natured that I was determined
that the custom-house officer at the land-
ing should have no fee from me. The
only article that could have been subject
to duty was on top of everything in the
trunk, except a single covering of some
loose garment, so that only a touch was
necessary to find it. When it came to
the examination, the officer threw the
top till contemptuously aside, and de-
voted himself to a thorough search of
the bottom. The only unusual object he
stumbled upon was a spyglass inclosed
in a shield of morocco. Perhaps a ges-
ture and a remark on my part roused
his suspicions. He opened the glass,
tried to take it to pieces, inspected it in-
side and out, and was so disgusted with
his failure to find anything contraband
in it that he returned everything to the
trunk, and let us off.</PB>

	It is commonly and quite justly sup-
posed that the more familiar the travel-
er is with the language of the place he
visits, the better he will get along. It
is a common experience to find that even
when you can pronounce the language,
you cannot understand what is said. But
there are exceptions to all rules, and cir-
cumstances now and then occur in which
one thus afflicted has the advantage over
the native~ You can talk to him, while
he cannot talk to you. There was an
amusing case of this kind at Munich.
The only train that would take us to
Berlin before nightfall of the same day
left at eight oclock in the morning, by
a certain route. There was at Munich
what we call a union station. I stopped
at the first ticket-office where I saw the
word Berlin on the glass, asked for
a ticket good in the train that was going
to leave at eight oclock the next morn-
ing for Berlin, and took what the seller
gave me. He was a stupid-looking fel-
low, so when I got to my hotel I showed
the ticket to a friend. That is not the
ticket that you want at all, said he;
it will take you by a circuitous route
in a train that does not leave until after
nine, and you will not reach Bcrlin un-
til long after dark. I went directly
back to the station and showed my ticket
to the agent.
	I  asked  you for  a ticket
	good  in  the  train  which 
leaves  at  eight  o  clock. This
	ticket  is  not  good  in 
that  train. Sic  haben  mich 
betrilgen. I  want  you  to  take
	the  ticket  back  and  return
	me  the  money. What you 
say  can  I  not  understand.
	He expostulated, gesticulated, and
fumed, but I kept up the bombardment
until he had to surrender. He motioned
to me to step round into the office,
where he took the ticket and returned
the money. I mention the matter be-
cause taking back a ticket is said to be
quite unusual on a German railway.
	At Berlin, the leading astronomers,
then, as now, were Ftwster, director of
the observatory, and Auwers, perma-
nent secretary of the Academy of Sci-
ences. I was especially interested in
the latter, as we had started in life
nearly at the same time, and had done
much work on similar lines. It was
several days before I made his acquaint-
ance, as I did not know that the rule on
the Continent is that the visitor must
make the first call, or at least make it
known by direct communication that he
would be pleased to see the resident;
otherwise it is presumed that lie does
not wish to see callers. This is certain-
ly the more logical system, but it is not
so agreeable to the visiting stranger as
ours is. The art of making the latter
feel at home is not brought to such per-
fection on the Continent as in England;
perhaps the French understand it less
than any other people. But none can be
pleasanter than the Germans, when you
once make their acquaintance; and we
shall always remember with pleasure the
winter we passed in Berlin.
	To-day, Auwers stands at the head of
German astronomy. In him is seen the
highest type of the scientific investigator
of our time, one perhaps better developed
in Germany than in any other country.
The work of men of this type is marked
by minute and careful research, untir-
ing industry in the accumulation of facts,
caution in propounding new theories or
explanations, and, above all, the absence
of effort to gain recognition by being
the first to make a discovery. When
men are ambitious to figure as New-
tons of some great principle, there is
a constant temptation to publish unveri-
fied speculations which are likely rather
to impede than to promote the advance of
knowledge. The result of Auwers con-
scientiousness is that, notwithstanding
his eminence in his science, there are
few astronomers of note whose works
are less fitted for popular exposition than
his. His specialty has been the treat-</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00395" SEQ="0395" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="389">	Reminiscences of an Astronomer.	389
inent of all questions concerning ~he po-
sitions and motions of the stars. This
work has required accurate observations
of position, with elaborate and careful
investigations of a kind that offer no
feature to attract public attention, and
only in exceptional cases lead to conclu-
sions that would interest the general read-
er. He considers no work as ready for
publication until it is completed in every
detail, showing in this a conscientious-
ness which his fellow astronomers may
sometimes have reason to regret, owing
to the length of time they have to wait
for his conclusions.
	The old astronomical observations of
which I was in quest might well have
been made by other astronomers than
those of Paris, so while awaiting the end
of the war I tried to make a thorough
search of the writings of the medheval
astronomers in the Royal Libraiy. If
one knew exactly what books he wanted,
and had plenty of time at his disposal,
he would find no difficulty in consulting
them in any of the great Continental
libraries. But, at the time of my visit,
notwithstanding the cordiality with which
all the officials, from Professor Lepsius
down, were disposed to second my efforts,
the process of getting any required book
was very elaborate. Although one could
obtain a book on the same day he or-
dered it, if he went in good time, it was
advisable to leave the order the day be-
fore, if possible. When, as in the pre-
sent case, one book only suggests anoth-
er, this a third, and so on, in an endless
chain, the carrying on of an extended
research is very tedious.
	One feature of the library strongly
impressed me with the comparatively
backward state of mathematical science
in our own country. As is usual in the
great European libraries, those books
which are most consulted are placed in
the general reading-room, where any one
can have access to them, at any moment.
It was surprising to see amongst these
books a set of Crelles Journal of Mathe
matics, and to find it well worn by con~
stant use. At that time, so far as I could
learn, there were not more than two or
three sets of the Journal in the United
States; and these were almost unused.
Even the Library of Congress did not
contain a set. There has been a great
change since that time,  a change in
which the Johns Hopkins University
took the lead, by inviting Sylvester to
this country, and starting a mathemati-
cal school of the highest grade. Other
universities followed its example to such
an extent that, to-day, an American stu-
dent need not leave his own country to
hear a master in any branch of mathe-
matics.
	I believe it was Dr. B. A. Gould
who called the Pulkova observatory the
astronomical capital of the world. This
institution was founded in 1839 by the
Emperor INicholas, on the initiative of
his greatest astronomer. It is situated
some twelve miles south of St. Peters-
burg, not far from the railway between
that city and Berlin, and gets its name
from a peasant village in the neighbor-
hood. From its foundation it has taken
the lead in exact measurements relating
to the motion of the earth and the posi-
tions of the principal stars. An impor-
tant part of its equipment is an astro-
nomical library, which is perhaps the
most complete in existence. This, added
to all its other attractions, induced me
to pay a visit to Pulkova. Otto Struve,
the director, had been kind enough to
send me a message, expressing the hope
that I would pay him a visit, and giving
directions about telegraphing in advance,
so as to insure the delivery of the dis-
patch. The time from Berlin to St. Pe-
tersburg is about forty-eight hours, the
only through train leaving and arrving
in the evening. On the morning of the
day that the train was due I sent the
dispatch. Early in the afternoon, as
the train was stopping at a way station,
I saw an official running hastily from one
car to another, looking into each with</PB>

some concern. When he came to my
door, he asked if I had sent a telegram
to Estafetta. I told him I had. He
then informed me that Estafetta had not
received it. But the train was already
beginning to move, so there was no fur-
ther chance to get information. The
comical part of the matter was that Es-
tafetta merely means a post or postman,
and that the directions, as Struve had
given them, were to have the dispatch
sent by postman from the station to Pul-
kova.
	It was late in the evening when the
train reached Zarsko-Selo, the railway
station for Pulkova, which is about five
miles away. The station - master told
me that no carriage from Pulkova was
waiting for me, which tended to confirm
the fear that the dispatch had not been
received. After making known my
plight, I took a seat in the station and
awaited the course of events, in some
doubt what to do. Only a few minutes
had elapsed when a good-looking peasant,
well wrapped in a fur overcoat, with a
whip in his hand, looked in at the door,
and pronounced very distinctly the words,
Observatorio Pulkova. Ah! this is
Struves driver at last, thought I, and I
followed th~ man to the door. But when
I looked at the conveyance, doubt once
more supervened. It was scarcely more
than a sledge, and was drawn by a sin-
gle horse, evidently more familiar with
hard work than good feeding. This did
not seem exactly the vehicle that the
great Russian observatory would send
out to meet a visitor; yet it was a far
country, and I was not acquainted with
its customs.
	The way in which my doubt was dis-
pelled shows that there is one subject
besides love on which difference of lan-
guage is no bar to the communication of
ideas. This is the desire of the uncivi-
lized man for a little coin of the realm.
In South Africa, Zulu chiefs, who do not
know one other word of English, can say
shilling with unmistakable distinct-
ness. My Russian driver did not know
even this little English word, but he
knew enough of the universal language.
When we had made a good start on the
snow-covered prairie, he stopped, looked
round at me inquiringly, raised his hand,
and stretched out two fingers so that I
could see them against the starlit sky.
	I nodded assent.
	Then he drew his overcoat tightly
around him with a gesture of shivering
from the cold, beat his hands upon his
breast as if to warm it, and looked at me
inquiringly.
	I nodded again.
	The bargain was complete. He was
to have two rubles for the drive, and a
little something besides to comfort his
shivering breast. So he could not be
Struve s man.
	There is no welcome warmer than a
Russian one, arid none in any country
warmer than that which the visiting
astronomer receives at an observatory.
Great is the contrast between the winter
sky of a clear, moonless night and the in-
terior of a dining-room, forty feet square,
with a big blazing fire at one end and
a table in the middle. The fact that
the visitor had never before met one of
his hosts detracted nothing from the
warmth of his reception.
	The organizer of the observatory, and
its first director, was Wilhelm Struve,
father of the one who received me, and
equally great as man and astronomer.
Like many other good Russians, he was
the father of a large family. One of
his sons was for ten years the Russian
minister at Washington. The instru-
ments which Struve designed sixty years
ago still do the finest work of any in the
world; but one may suspect this to be
due more to the astronomers who handle
them than to the instruments themselves.
	The air is remarkably clear; the en-
trance to St. Petersburg, ten or twelve
miles north, is distinctly visible; and
Struve told me that during the Crimean
war he could see, through the great tele</PB>

scope, the men on the decks of th~ Brit-
ish ships besieging Kronstadt, thirty
miles away.
	One drawback from which the astro-
nomers suffer is the isolation of the place.
The village at the foot of the little hill
is inhabited only by peasants, and the
astronomers and employees have nearly
all to be housed in the observatory build-
ings. There is no society but their own
nearer than the capitaL At the time of
my visit the scientific staff was almost
entirely German or Swedish, by birth or
language. In the state, two opposing
parties are the Russian, which desires the
ascendency of the native Muscovites, and
the German, which appreciates the fact
that the best and most valuable of the
Tsars subjects are of German or other
foreign descent. During the past twen-
ty years the Russian party has gradually
got the upper hand; and the result of
this ascendency at Pulkova will be looked
for with much solicitude by astronomers
everywhere.
	Once a year the lonely life of the as-
tronomers is enlivened by a grand feast,
 that of the Russian New Year. One
object of the great dining-room which I
have mentioned, the largest room, I be-
lieve, in the whole establishment, was to
make this feast possible. My visit took
place early in March, so that I did not
see the celebration; but from what I have
heard, the little colony does what it can
to make up for a year of ennui. Every
twenty-five years it celebrates a jubilee;
the second came off in 1889.
	There is much to interest the visitor
in a Russian peasant village, and that of
Pulkova has features some of which I
have never seen described. Above the
door of each log hut is the name of the
occupant, and below the name is a rude
picture of a bucket, hook, or some other
piece of apparatus used in extinguishing
fire. Inside, the furniture is certainly
meagre enough, yet one could not see
why the occupants should be otherwise
than comfortable. I know of no good
reason why ignorance should imply un-
happiness; altogether, there is some good
room for believing that the less civilized
races can enjoy themselves, in their own
way, about as well as we can. What im-
pressed me as the one serious hardship
of the peasantry was their hours of labor.
Just how many hours of the twenty-four
these beings find for sleep was not clear
to the visitor; they seemed to be at
work all day, and at midnight many of
them had to start on their way to St.
Petersburg with a cartload for the mar-
ket. A church ornamented with tinsel
is a feature of every Russian village;
so also are the priests. The only two I
saw were sitting on a fence, wearing gar-
ments that did not give evidence of hav-
ing known water since they were made~
One great drawback to the growth of
manufactures in Russia is the number of
feast days, on which the native operators
must one and all abandon their work, re-
gardless of consequences.
	The astronomical observations made
at Pulkova are not published annually,
as are those made at most of the other
national observatories, but a volume re-
lating to one subject is issued whenever
the work is done. When I was there,
the volumes containing the earlier me-
ridian observations were in press. Struve
and his chief assistant, Dr. Wagner,used
to pore nightly over the proof sheets, be-
stowing on every word and detail a mi-
nute attention which less patient astro-
nomers would have found extremely irk-
some.
	Dr. Wagner was a son-in-law of Han-
sen, the astronomer of the little ducal
observatory at Gotha, as was also our
Bayard Taylor. My first meeting with
Hansen, which occurred after my re-
turn to Berlin, was not devoid of inter-
est. Modest as was the public position
that he held, he may now fairly be con-
sidered the greatest master of celestial
mechanics since Laplace. In what or-
der Leverrier, Delaunay, Adams, and
Hill should follow him, it is not neces</PB>

sary to decide. To many readers, it will
seem singular to place any name ahead
of that of the master who pointed out
the position of Neptune before a human
eye had ever recognized it. But this
achievement, great as it was, was more
remarkable for its boldness and brilliancy
than for its inherent difficulty. If the
work had to be done over again to-day,
there are a number of young men who
would be as successful as Leverrier; but
there are none who would attempt to re-
invent the methods of Hansen, or even
to improve radically upon them. Their
main feature is the devising of new and
refined methods of computing the vari-
ations in the motions of a planet pro-
duced by the attraction of all the other
planets. As Laplace left this subject,
the general character of these variations
could be determined without difficulty,
but the computations could not be made
with mathematical exactness. Hansens
methods led to results so precise that, if
they were fully carried out, it is doubtful
whether any deviation between the pre-
dicted and the observed motions of a
planet could be detected by the most re-
fined observation.
	At the time of my visit Mrs. Wagner
was suffering from a severe illness, of
which the crisis passed while I was at
Pulkova, and left her, as was supposed, on
the road to recovery. I was, of course,
very desirous of meeting so famous a
man as Hansen. He was expected to
preside at a session of the German com-
mission on the transit of Venus, which
was to be held in Berlin about the time
of my return thither from Pulkova. The
opportunity was therefore open of bring-
ing a message of good news from his
daughter. Apart from this, the prospect
of the meeting might have been embar-
rassing. The fact is that I was at odds
with him on a scientific question, and he
was a man who did not take a charitable
view of those who differed from him in
opinion.
	He was the author of a theory, current
thirty or forty years ago, that the farther
side of the moon is composed of denser
materials than the side turned toward
us. As a result of this, the centre of
gravity of the moon was supposed to be
farther from us than the actual centre
of her globe. It followed that, although
neither atmosphere nor water existed on
our side of the moon, the other side
might have both. Here was a very
tempting field, into which astronomical
speculators stepped, to clothe the invisi-
ble hemisphere of the moon with a beau-
tiful terrestrial landscape, and to people
it as densely as they pleased with beings
like ourselves. If these beings should
ever attempt to explore the other half of
their own globe, they would find them-
selves ascending to a height completely
above the limits of their atmosphere.
Hansen himself never countenanced such
speculations as these, but confined his
claims to the simple facts he supposed
proven.
	In 1868 I had published a little pa-
per showing what I thought a fatal de-
fect, a vicious circle in fact, in Hansens
reasoning on this subject. Not long be-
fore my visit, Delaunay had made this
paper the basis of a communication to the
French Academy of Sciences, in which
he not only indorsed my views, but sought
to show the extreme improbability of
Hansens theory on other grounds.
	When I first reached Germany, on
my way from Italy, I noticed copies of a
blue pamphlet lying on the tables of the
astronomers. Apparently, the paper had
1)een plentifully distributed; but it was
not until I reached Berlin that I found
it was Hansens defense against my stric-
tures,  a defense in which mathematics
were not unmixed with scathing sarcasm
at the expense of both Delannay and my-
self. The case brought to mind a warm
discussion between Hansen and Eneke,
in the pages of a scientific journal, some
fifteen years before. At the time it had
seemed intensely comical to see two
enraged combatants  for so I amused</PB>

myself by fancying them  hurling al-
gebraic formuhe, of frightful complexity,
at each others heads. I did not then
dream that I should live to be an object
of the same sort of attack, and that from
Hansen himself.
	To be revised, pulled to pieces, or su-
perseded, as science advances, is the com-
mon fate of most astronomical work, even
the best. It does not follow that it has
been done in vain; if good, it forms a
foundation on which others will build.
But not every great investigator can look
on with philosophic calm when he sees
his work thus treated, and Hansen was
among the last who could.
	Under these circumstances, it was a
serious question what sort of reception
Hansen would accord to a reviser of his
conclusions who should venture to ap-
proach him. I determined to assume an
attitude that would show no conscious-
ness of offense. Our meeting was not
attended by any explosion; I gave him
the pleamnt message with which I was
charged from his daughter, and, a few
days later, sat by his side at a dinner of
the German commission on the coming
transit of Yenus.
	As Hansen was Germanys greatest
master in mathematical astronomy, so
was the venerable Argelander in the ob-
servational side of the science. He was
of the same age as the newly crowned
Emperor, and the two were playmates
at the time Germany was being overrun
by the armies of Napoleon. He was
held in love and respect by the entire
generation of young astronomers, both
Germans and foreigners, many of whom
were proud to have had him as their
preceptor. Among these was Dr. B. A.
Gould, who frequently related a story of
the astronomers wit. When with him as
a student, Gould was beardless, but had
a good head of hair. Returning some
years later, he had become bald, but had
made up for it by having a full, long
beard. He entered Argelanders study
unannounced. At first the astronomer
did not recognize him.
	Do you not know me, Herr Profes-
sor?
	The astronomer looked more closely.
Mein Gott! It is Gould mit his hair
struck through.
	Argelander was more than any one
else the founder of that branch of his
science which treats of variable stars.
His methods have been followed by his
successors to the present time. It was
his policy to make the best use he could
of the instruments at his disposal, rather
than to invent new ones that might prove
of doubtful utility. The results of his
work seem to justify this policy.

	THE Isle of Jersey has the shape of a

this tiger are the lacerating pinnacles

none at all on the dark and menacing
headland. But the ancient Royal Court,
as if determined to prove its sovereignty
even over the tigers head, had stretched
out its arms from the Vier Marchi to the
neck of the beast, putting upon it a belt
of defensive war: at the nape, a martello
tower and barracks; underneath, two
other martello towers, to be the teeth of

Tall platforms were erected at almost
speaking distance one from another,
where sentinels kept watch for the de-

leave his trade and act as sentinel, or go
into camp or barracks with the militia for
months at a time. British cruisers sailed
the Channel; now a squadron under Bar-

like a buttress. At one side, between it
and the western wall, was a veille hung
with curtains, which was both lounge
and bed. The eastern chimney-side was
given over to a few well-polished kitchen
utensils, a churn, and a bread-trough.
The floor was of mother earth alone, but
a strip of hand-made carpet was laid
down before the fireplace, and there was
another at the end opposite. There were
also a table, a spinning-wheel, and a shelf
of books.
	It was not the hut of a fisherman,
though upon the wall opposite the books
there hung fishing-tackle, nets, and cords,
while outside, on staples driven into the
chimney, were some lobster-pots. Upon
two shelves were arranged a carpenters
and a coopers tools, polished and in
good order. And yet you would have
said that neither a cooper nor a carpen-
ter kept them in use. Everywhere there
were signs of mans handicraft as well
as of womans work, but over it all was
the touch of a woman. Moreover, apart
from the tools there was no sign of a
mans presence in the hut. There was
no coat hanging behind the door, no sa-
bots for the fields and oilskins for the
sands, no pipe laid upon a ledge, no
shoemakers awl or fishermans needle
fastening a calendar to the wall. The
awl and the needle were there, but they
were neatly put in their places upon the
shelves. Whatever was the trade of the
occupant, the tastes were above those of
the ordinary dweller in the land. That
was to be seen in a print of Raphaels
Madonna and Child, taking the place of
the usual sampler upon the walls of Jer-
sey houses; in the old clock, nicely be-
stowed between a narrow cupboard and
the tool-shelves; in a few pieces of rare
old china, and a gold - handled sword
hanging above a huge well - carved oak
chair. This chair relieved the room of
anything like commonness, and somehow
in its rough carving was in sympathy with
the simple surroundings, making for dig-
nity and sweet quiet. It was clear that
only a woman could have so arranged the
room and all therein. It was also clear
that no man lived there.
	If you had looked in at the doorway
of this but on a certain autumn day of
the year 1796, the first thing to strike
your attention would have been a dog
lying asleep on the hearth; then a suit
of childs clothes on a chair before the
fire would have caught the eye. The only
thing to distinguish this particular childs
dress from that of a thousand others in
the island was the fineness of the mate.
rial. Every thread of it had been deli-
cately and firmly knitted till it was like
perfect cloth, gracious in texture and in
color a soft blue, relieved by a little red
silk ribbon attached to the collar.
	The hut contained as well a childs
chair, just so high that when placed by
the window commanding the Dirouilles
or the Paternosters its occupant might
see the waves, like panthers, beating
white paws against the ragged pinnacles
of granite; the currents writhing below
at the foot of the cliffs, or at half-tide,
roaring and resounding, rush up and
cover the sands of the Gr~ve aux Lan-
~ons, and, like animals in pain, howl
through the caverns in the cliffs; the
great northwester of November come
breaking up the deep to batter the im-
perturbable cliffs of Grosnez and Ple-
mont, to shriek to the witches who boiled
their caldrons by the ruins of Grosnez
Castle that the hunt of the seas was up.
Just higb enough was the little chair
that its owner might, of a certain day
in the year, look out and see the mystic
fires that burned round the Paternosters,
lighting up all the sea with a strange
and awful radiance.
	Scarce a rock to be seen from the hut
but had such a legend: the burning ship
at the Paternosters; the horse and its
rider at Williams Rock in Boulay Bay;
the fleet of boats with tall prows and long
oars that drifted upon the Dirouilles, and
went down to the cry of the Crusaders
Dahin! dthin! the Roche des</PB>

Femmes at the Ecr6hos, where still you
may hear the cries of the women and
children in terror of the engulfing sea.
	On this particular day, if you had
looked into the hut, or waited by the fire
of vraic burning so softly in the chim-
ney hour after hour, no one would have
welcomed you, neither woman nor child;
but had you tired of waiting, and tra-
veled along the coast, following its in-
dentations for two miles or more from the
hut, in a deep bay under tall cliffs, you
would have seen a woman and a child
coming quickly up the sands. Slung
upon the womans shoulders was a small
fishermans basket. The child ran be-
fore, eager to climb the hill and take the
homeward path.
	A man above was watching them. He
had ridden up the cliff, had seen the wo-
man in her boat making for the shore,
had tethered his horse in the quarries
near by, and now waited for her to come
up. He chuckled to himself as she am
proached, for he had prepared a sur-
prise for her. To make it more com-
plete he hid himself behind some shrubs
and boulders, and as she reached the top
he sprang out before her with an ugly
grin on his face.
	The woman looked at him calmly, and
waited for him to speak. There was no
fear on her face, not even surprise; no-
thing but steady inquiry and a discon-
certing self-possession. Presently, with
an air of bluster, the man said, Aha,
my lady, I m nearer than you thought
 me!
	The child drew in to his mothers side
and clasped her hand. There was no
terror in the little fellows eyes, however;
rather, a shrinking from the mans brutal
manner. He had something of the same
self-possession as the woman, and his
eyes were like hers, clear, unwavering,
and with a frankness that consumed you;
they were wells of sincerity. Open-eyed,
you would have called the child, want-
ing a more subtle description.
	I m not to be fooled  me! Come,
now, let s have the count, said the man,
as he whipped a greasy leather-covered
book from his pocket and opened it.
Ah bah, I m waiting. Stay yourself!
he added roughly as she moved on, and
his grayish-yellow face had an evil joy
at thought of the ambush he had laid
for her.
	Who are you? she asked, but tak-
ing her time to ask.
	Sacr~ matin! you know who I am.
	I know what you are, she answered
quietly.
	He did not quite grasp her meaning,
but the tone sounded contemptuous, and
contempt sorted little with his ideas of
his own importance.
	I m the seigneurs bailiff,  that s
who I am. Gadrabotin, dont you put
on airs with me! I m for the tribute,
so off with your bag and let s see your
catch!
	I have never yet paid tribute to the
seigneur of this manor.
	Well, you 11 begin now. I m the
new bailiff, and if you dont pay your
tale, up you 11 come to the court of the
fief to-morrow.
	She looked him steadily in the eyes.
If I were a man, I should not pay the
tribute, and should go to the court of the
fief to-morrow; but being a woman, 
she clasped the hand of the child tightly
to her for an instant; then, with a sigh,
she took the basket froum her shoulders,
and, opening it, added,  but being a
woman, the fish I caught in the sea, which
belongs to God and to all men, I will di-
vide with the seigneur whose bailiff spies
on poor fisherfolk.
	The man growled an oath, and made
a motion as though he would catch her
by the shoulder in anger, or maybe strike
her, but the look in her eyes stopped him.
Counting out the fish, and setting apart
for him three out of the eight she had
caught, she said, It matters not so much
to me, but there are others poorer than
I; they suffer.
	With a leer, the fellow stooped, and,</PB>

taking up the fish, put them in the pock-
ets of his keminzolle, all slimy from the
sea as they were.
	Bk sfl, you have nt got much to take
care of, have you? It dont take much
to feed two mouths,  not so much as it
does three, mamselle.
	Before he had finished speaking, the
woman, without a word in reply to the
gross insult, took the child by the hand
and walked along her homeward path
toward Plemont.
	A bit6t, good-by! the bailiff
laughed brutally; then, standing with his
legs apart and his hands thrust down till
they fastened on the fish in the pockets
of his kemiuzolle, he called after her in

pride did nt fall  bk sit!
	Eh ben, I ye got mackerel for sup-
per, he added, as he mounted his horse.
	The woman was Guida Landresse, the
child was her child, and they lived in the
little house upon the cliff at Plemont.
They were hastening thither now.


xxx.
	A visitor was awaiting Gdida, a man,
who, first knocking at the door, then look-
ing in and seeing the room empty save
for the dog lying asleep by the fire, had
turned slowly away, and going to the
cliff edge looked out over the sea. His
movements were deliberate, his body
moved slowly; his whole appearance
was that of great strength and nervous
power. The face was preoccupied; the
eyes were watchful, dark, penetrating.
They seemed not only to watch, but to
weigh, to meditate, even to listen,  as
it were, to do the duty of all the senses
at once. In them worked all the forces
of his nature; they were crucibles in
which every thought and emotion were
consumed. The jaw was set and strong,
yet it was not hard. The face contra-
dicted itself. While not gloomy, it had
lines like scars telling of past wounds.
It was not despairing, it was not morbid,
and it was not resentful; it had the look
of one both credulous and indomitable.
Belief was stamped upon it; not ex-
pectation, or dreams, or ambition, but
trust and fidelity. You would have said
he was a man of one set idea, though
the head had a breadth sorting little with
narrowness of purpose. The body was
too healthy to belong to a fanatic, too
powerful to be that of a dreamer alone,
too reposeful and firm for other than a
man of action.
	Several times he turned to look to-
ward the house and up the pathway
leading from the hillock to the door.
Though he waited long he did not seem
impatient; patience was part of him, and
not the least part. At last he sat down
on a boulder between the house and the
shore, and scarcely moved as minute af-
ter minute passed, and then an hour, and
more, and no one came. At last there
was a soft footstep beside him, and be
turned. A dogs nose thrust itself into
his hand.
	Biribi, Biribi!  he said, patting its
head with his big band. Watching and
waiting, eb, Biribi? The dog looked
into his eyes as if it knew what was said
and would speak,  or indeed was speak-
ing in its own language. That s the
way of life, Biribi,  watching and wait-
ing, and watching, always watching.
	Suddenly the dog caught its head
away from his hand, gave a short, joyful
bark, and darted up the hillock.
	Guida and the child, the man said
aloud, moving toward the house, 
Guida and the child.
	He saw her and the little one before
they saw him. Presently the child said,
See, maman! and pointed.
	Guida started. A swift flush passed
over her face; then she smiled and made
a step forward to meet her visitor.
	Maitre Ranulph  Ranulph! she
said, holding out her hand. It s a
long time since we met.
	A year, he answered simply, just</PB>

a year. He looked down at the child;
then stooped and caught him up in his
arms, and said, He s grown. Es-tu
gentiment? he added to the child, 
es-hi gentiment, msieu?
	The child did not quite understand
this. Please? he said in true Jersey
fashion, at which the mother was trou-
bled.
	Oh, oh, Guilbert, is that what you
should say?
	The child looked up quaintly at her,
and, with the same whimsical smile which
Guida had given to another so many
years before, he looked at Ranuiph and
said, Pardon, monsieur?
	Coum est quon ~tes, msieu?  said
Ranuiph in another patois greeting.
	Guida shook her head reprovingly.
The child glanced swiftly at his mother,
as though for permission to reply as he
wished, then back at Ranulph, and was
about to speak, when Guida said, I
have not taught him the Jersey patois,
Ranulph; only English and French.
	Her eyes met his clearly, meaningly.
Her look said to him as plainly as words,
The childs destiny is not here. But
as if he knew that in this she was blind-
ing herself, and that no one can escape
the influences of surroundings, he held
the child back from him, and with a smile
said, Coum est-ce quon est, msieu?
	Now the child, with his own elfish
sense of the situation, replied in English,
Naicely, then kyou!
	You see, said Ranulph to Guida,
there are things that are stronger than
we are. There s a teaching deeper than
anything we may show. The wind and
earth and sea, and people we live with,
they make us sing their song one way
or another. It s in our bones.
	A look of pain passed over Guidas
face; she turned almost abruptly to the
doorway, and said, with just the slightest
hesitation, You will come in?
	There was no hesitation on his part.
Oui-gia! he returned, and stepped in-
side.
	She hastily hung up the childs cap
and her own; and as she gathered in the
soft, waving hair, Ranuiph noticed how
the years had only burnished it more
deeply and strengthened the beauty of
the head. She had made the gesture
unconsciously, but catching the look in
his eye a sudden thrill of anxiety ran
through her. Recovering herself, how-
ever, and with an air of bright friendli-
ness and hospitality, she laid her hand
upon the great armchair above which
hung the ancient sword of her ancestor,
the Comte Guilbert Mauprat de Chain-
b~ry, and said, Sit here, Ranulph.
	Seating himself he gave a heavy sigh,
 one of those passing breaths of con-
tent which come to the hardest lives
now and then; as though the spirit of
life itself, in ironical apology for human
existence, gave the instant of respite
from which hope is born again. Not
for four long years had Ranuiph sat
thus quietly in the presence of Guida.
At first, when Maitresse Aimable had
told him that Guida was leaving the
Place du Vier Prison to live in this
lonely place with her new-born child,
he had gone to entreat her to remain;
but Maitresse Aimable had been present
then, and all that he could say  all
that he might speak out of his friend-
ship, out of the old love, now deep piti-
fulness dnd sorrow  was of no avail.
It had been borne in upon him then that
she was not morbid, but that her mind
had a sane, fixed purpose which she was
intent to fulfill. It was as though she
had made some strange covenant with a
little helpless life, with a little face that
was all her face; and that covenant she
would keep.
	So he had left her, and so to do her
service had been granted elsewhere. The
Chevalier du Champsavoys, with a per-
fect wisdom and nobility, insisted on be-
ing to Guida what he had always been,
speaking as naturally of her and the
child as though there had always been
a Guida and the child. Thus it was</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00405" SEQ="0405" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="399">	The Battle of the Strong.	399
that he counted himself her protector,
though he sat far away in the upper
room of Elie Mattingleys house in the
Rue dEgypte, thinking his own thoughts,
hiding the time when Guida should come
back to the world, and mystery he over,
and peace and happiness return; hoping
only that he might live to see it.
	Under his directions, Jean Touzel had
removed the few things that Guida took
with her to Plemont; instructed by him,
Elie Mattingley sold at auction the house
and its furniture, and Guida invested the
proceeds with the fishing company which
already received the yearly income from
her mothers small property.
	Thus Guida had settled at Plemont,
and thei~e three years of her life had
passed.
	Your father,  how is he? asked
Guida presently.
	Feebler, replied Ranulph; he goes
abroad but little now.
	It was said that the Royal Court
was to make him a gift in remembrance
of the battle of Jersey.
	Ranulph turned his head away from
her to the child, and beckoned him over.
The little one came instantly. As iRa-
nulph lifted him on his knee he answered
Guida: My Lather did not accept.
	Then they said you were to be con-
n~table,  the grand monsieur! She
smiled at him in a friendly way.
	I did not accept, replied Ranulph.
	Most people would be glad of it,
rejoined Guida. My mother used to
say you would be bailly one day.
	Who knows ?  perhaps I might
have been!
	She looked at him half sadly, half cu-
riously. You  you have nt any am-
bition now, Maitre Ranuiph?
	It suddenly struck her that perhaps
she was responsible for the maiming of
this mans life; for clearly it was maimed.
More than once she had thought of it,
but it came home to her to-day with pe-
culiar force. Years ago every one had
spoken of Ranulph Delagarde as one
who might do great things; for to the
eyes of a Jerseyman to be bailly was to
be great, with six jurats sitting on either
side of him, and more importance than
any judge in the kingdom. As she looked
back now, that day on the Ecr6hos, when
she had met Philip dAvranche and Ra-
nulphs father had returned, seemed to
mark the change in him. He had never
been the same since then.
	A great bitterness welled up in her.
Without intention, without blame or sin,
she had brought suffering upon others.
The untoward happenings of her life had
killed her grandfather, had bowed and
aged the old chevalier, had forced her to
reject the friendship of Carterette Mat-
tingley,  for Carterettes own sake, 
had made the heart of one fat old wo-
man heavy within her; and she felt now
that it had taken hope and ambition
from the life of this man before her.
Love in itself is but a bitter pleasure:
when it is given to the unworthy it be-
comes a torture; and so far as Ranuiph
and the world knew, she was wholly
unworthy. Of late she had sometimes
wondered if, after all, she had had the
right to do as she had done: as though,
indeed, she had asked herself whether
any one person, in serene independence
of conscience, may stand quite free to
live regardless of all others in the world;
whether to act for ones own heart, feel-
ings, and life alone, no matter how per-
fect the honesty, is not a sort of noble
cruelty, or cruel nobility,  an egotism
which obeys but its own commandments,
llnding its own straight and narrow path
by first disbarring the feelings and lives
of others. It had now and again oc-
curred to her, had she done what was
best for the child ? Any moment~ s mis-
giving upon this point made her heart
ache bitterly. Was life, then, a series of
triste condonings at the best, of humili-
ating compromises at the worst?
	She repeated her question to Ranulph:
You have nt ambition any longer?
	I m busy building ships, he an-</PB>

swered evasively. I build good ships,
they tell me, and I am strong and
healthy. As for being conn~table, I
should rather, I m afraid, help prisoners
free than hale them before the Royal
Court. For somehow, when you get at
the bottom of most crimes,  the small
ones, leastways,  you find that they
were nt quite meant I expect  I ex-
pect that half the crimes ought never to
be punished at all; for it s strange that
those things which hurt most cant be
punished by law.
	Perhaps it evens up in the long end,
replied Guida, turning away from him
to the fire, and feeling her heart beat
faster as she saw how the child nestled in
Ranuiphs arms,  the child who had no
father. You see, she added, if some
are punished who ought nt to be, there
are others who ought to be that are nt.
And the worst of it is, we care so little
for real justice that we would nt punish
if we could,  I have come to feel that.
Sometimes, if you do exactly whats right,
you hurt some one you dont wish to
hurt; and if you dont do exactly what s
right, perhaps that some one else hurts
you. So, often, we would rather be hurt
than hurt.
	With the last words she turned from
the fire and involuntarily faced him.
Their eyes met. In hers were only the
pity of life, the sadness, the cruelty of
misfortune, and friendliness for him. In
his eyes was purpose, definite, strong.
	He went over and put the child in his
high-chair. Then coming a little nearer
to Guida, he said, There s only one
thing in life that really hurts,  playing
false.
	Her heart suddenly stopped heating.
What was Ranulph going to say? After
all these years was he going to speak of
Philip? But she did not reply accord-
ing to her thought.
	Have people played false in your
life, ever? she asked.
	H you 11 listen to me, I 11 tell you
how, he answered.
	Wait, wait, she said, in trepidation.
It  it has nothing to do with me?
	He shook his head. It has only to
do with my father and myself. When
I ye told you, then you must say whether
you will have anything to do with it or
with me. . . . You remember, he con-
tinued, without waiting for her to speak,
you remember that day upon the Ecr&#38; 
hos, four years ago? Well, that day
I had made up my mind to tell you in
so many words what I hoped you had al-
ways known, Guida. I did nt. Why?
Not because of another man,  no, no,
I dont mean to hurt you, but I must
tell you the truth now,  not because of
another man, for I should have bided
my chance with him.
	Ranulph, Ranulph, she broke in,
you must not speak of this now Do
you not see it hurts me? It is not like
you  it is not right of you 
A sudden emotion seized him, and his
voice shook.
	Not right? You should know that
I would never say one word to hurt you,
or do one thing to wrong you. But I
must speak to-day,  I must tell you
everything. I ye thought of it for four
long years, and I know now that what I
mean to do is right.
	She sat down in the great armchair.
A weakness came upon her; she was
being brought face to face with days of
which she had never allowed herself to
think, for she lived always in the future.
	Go on, she said helplessly. Tell
me what you have to say, Ranulph.
	I will tell you why I did nt speak
of my love to you, that day we went to
the Ecr6hos. ~y father came back that
day.
	Yes, yes, she returned; of course
you had to think of him.
	Yes, I had to think of him, but not
in the way you mean. Be patient a lit-
tle while, he added.
	Then in a few words he told her the
whole story of his fathers treachery and
crime, from the night before the battle of</PB>

Jersey up to their meeting again upon
the Ecr6hos.
	Guida was amazed and moved. Her
heart filled with pity. Ranuiph  poor
iRanuiph! she cried, half rising in her
seat.
	No, no,  wait, he rejoined. Sit
just where you are till I tell you all.
Guida, you dont know what a life it has
been for me these four years. I used
to be able to look every man in the face
without caring whether he liked me or
hated me; for then I had never lied, I
had never done a mean thing to any
man; I had never deceived,  nannin-
gia, never! But when my father came
back, then I had to play a false game.
He had lied, and to save him I either
had to hold my peace or tell his story.
Speaking was lying, and being silent was
lying. Mind you, I m not complaining.
I m not saying it because I want any
pity. No; I in saying it because it s
the truth, and I want you to know the
truth. You understand what it means
to feel right in your own mind; feel-
ing that way, the rest of life is easy.
Eh ben, what a thing it is to get up in
the morning, build your fire, make your
breakfast, and sit down facing a man
whose whole life is a lie, and that man
your own father! Some morning per-
haps you forget, and you go out into the
sun, and it all seems good out there, and
you take your tools and go to work, and
the sea comes washing up the shingle,
and you think that the shir-r-r-r of the
water on the pebbles and the singing of
the saw and the clanging of the ham-
mer are the best music in the world.
But all at once you remember !  and
then you work harder, not because you
love work now for its own sake, but be-
cause it uses up your misery and makes
you tired; and being tired you can
sleep, and in sleep you can forget. Yet
nearly all the time you re awake it fair-
ly kills you, for you feel some one al-
ways at your elbow, whispering, You 11
never be happy again,  you 11 never be
	VOL. LXXXII. NO. 491.	26
happy again. And when you tell the
truth about anything, that some one at
your elbow laughs, and says, Nobody
believes; your whole life s a lie. And
if the worst man you know passes you
by, that some one at your elbow says,
You can wear a mask, but you re no
better than he  no better, no 
While Ranulph spoke, Guidas face
showed a pity and a kindness as deep as
the sorrow which had deepened her na-
ture. She shook her head once or twice,
as though to say, Surely, what suffer-
ing! And now this seemed to strike
Ranulph, to convict him of selfishness,
for he suddenly stopped. His face pre-
sently cleared, and, smiling with a little
of his old-time unburdened cheerfulness,
he said, Yet one gets used to it, and one
works on because one knows that it will
all come right some time. I m of the
kind that waits.
	She looked up at him with her old
wide - eyed steadfastness, and replied,
You are a good man, Ranulph.
	He stood gazing at her a moment with-
out remark; then he said, No, but it s
like you to say I am. Then he added,
I ye told you the whole truth about
myself and about my father. He did a
bad thing, and I ye shielded him. At
first, nursing my troubles and my shame,
I used to think that I could nt live it out,
that I had no right to have any happi-
ness. But I ye changed my mind about
that,  oui-gia! As I hammered away
at my ships, month in, month out, year in,
year out, the truth came home to me at
last. What right had I to sit down and
brood over my miseries? I did nt love
my father, but I ye done wrong for him
and I ye stood by him; well, I did love
 and I do love  some one else, and
I should only be doing right to tell her
so, and to ask her to let me stand with
her against the world.
	He was looking down at her with all
his story in his face, and she put out her
hand quickly as if in protest, and said,
Ranulph  ah no, Ranulph  </PB>
<PB REF="IMG00408" SEQ="0408" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="402">	402	The Battle of the Strong.

	But yes, Guida, he replied, with
stubborn tenderness, it is you I mean,
 it is you I have always meant. You
have always been a hundred times more
to me than my father, but I let you fight
your fight alone. I ye waked up now
to my selfishness. But I tell you also
that, though I love you better than any-
thing in the world, if things had gone
well with you, I d never have come to
you. I never have come, because of my
father, and I d never have come, because
you are to.o far above me. I only come
now because we re both apart from the
world and lonely beyond telling, because
we need each other. I come with just
one thing to say, that we two should stand
together. There are none that can be
so near as those that have had hard trou-
bles, that have had bitter wrongs. And
when there s love, too, what can break the
bond? You and I, Guida, are apart from
the world, each in a black loneliness that
no one understands. Let us be lonely no
longer. Let us live our lives together.
What shall we care for the rest of the
world, if we know that we mean to do
good, and not wrong? So I ye come to
ask you to let me care for you and the
child,  to ask you to make my home
your home. My father has nt long to
live, and when he is gone we can leave
this island ferever. Will you come,
Guida?
	She had not taken her eyes from his,
and as his story grew her face lighted
with emotion,  the glow of a moments
content, of a fleeting joy. In spite of all,
this man loved her, he wanted to marry
her,  in spite of all. Glad to know
that such men lived, and with how som-
bre memories contrasting with this bright
experience, she said to him once again,
You are a good man, IRanulph.
	Coming near to her, he murmured in
a voice husky with feeling, You will be
my wife, Guida?
	She stood up, one hand resting on the
arm of the great chair, the other partly
extended in pitying deprecation. No,
Hanuiph, no; I can never, never be your
wife,  never in this world.
	For an instant he looked at her, dum-
founded, overwhelmed; then he turned
away to the fireplace slowly and heavily.
I suppose it was too much to hope for,
he said bitterly. He realized now how
much she was above him, even in her
sorrow and shame.
	You forget, she answered quietly,
and her hand went out suddenly to the
brown curls of the child, you forget
what the world says about ~
	There was a kind of fierceness in his
look as he turned to her again. Me 
I have always forgotten  everything,
lie returned. Have you thought that
for all these years I ye believed one
word? Secours dla vie! of what use is
faith, what use to trust, if you thought I
believed! I do not know the truth, for
you have not told me; but I do know, as
I know I have a heart in me, I do know
that there never was any wrong in you.
It is you who forget, he added quickly,
 it is you who forget. I tried to tell
you all this before,  three years ago
I tried to tell you. You stopped me,
you would not listen. Perhaps you have
thought I did not know what was hap-
pening to you every week, almost every
day of your life. A hundred times I
have walked here, and you have not seen
me: when you were asleep, when you
were fishing, when you were working
like a man in the fields and the garden,
 you who ought to be cared for by a
man, working like a slave at mans work!
But no, no, you have not thought well
of me, or you would have known that
every day I cared, every day I watched,
and waited, and hoped, and believed!
	She came to him slowly where lie stood,
his great frame trembling with his pas-
sion and the hurt she had given him, and,
laying her hand upon his arm, she said,
Your faith was a blind one, Ro. I was
either a girl who  who deserved nothing
of the world, or I was a wife. I had no
husband, had I? Then I must have been</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00409" SEQ="0409" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="403">	The Battle of the Strong.	403
a girl who  who deserved nothing of
the world or of you. Your faith was
blind, Ranuiph,  you see it was blind.
	What I know is this, he replied, with
dogged persistence,   what I know is
this: that whatever was wrong, there was
no wrong in you. My life a hundred
times on that!
She smiled at him, the brightest smile
that had been on ber face these years
past, and she answered softly, I did not
think there was so great faith; no, not
in Israel!  Then the happiness passed
from her lips to her eyes. Your faith
has made me happy, Ro; I am selfish,
you see. Your love in itself could not
make me happy, for I have no right to
listen to words of love, because 
She paused. It seemed too hard to
say; the door of her heart inclosing her
secret opened so slowly, so slowly. A
struggle was going on in her. Every fibre
of her nature was alive. Once, twice,
thrice, she tried to speak, and could not.
At last, with bursting soul and eyes swim-
ming with tears, she said solemnly, I
can never marry you, Ranulph, and I
have no right to listen to your words of
love, because  because I am a wife.
	Then she gave a great sigh of relief,
like some penitent who has for a lifetime
hidden a sin or a sorrow, and suddenly
finds the joy of a confessional that re-
lieves the sick heart, takes away the hand
of loneliness that clamps it, and gives it
freedom again; that lifts the poor slave
from the rack of secrecy, the most cruel
Inquisition of Life and Time. She said
the words once more, a little louder, a
little clearer. She had vindicated her-
self to God; now she had vindicated her-
self to man,  though to but one man.
	I cair never marry you, because I
am a wife, she repeated. There was
a slight pause, and then the final word
was said,  I am the wife of Philip
dAvranche.
	Ranuiph did not speak. He stood still
and rigid, looking with eyes that scarce-
ly saw her; for a mist of conflicting emo
tions and numb impressions had clouded
them.
	I had not intended to tell any one
until the time should come,  once
more her hand reached out and trem-
blingly stroked the head of the child,
but your belief in me has forced it
from me. I. could not now let you go
from me ignorant of the truth,  you
whose faith is beyond telling. Ranulph,
I want you to know that I am at least
110 worse than you thought me.
	The look in his face was one of tri-
umph, mingled with despair, hatred, and
purpose, hatred of Philip dAvranche,
and purpose concerning him. He gloried
now in knowing that Guida might take
her place among the honest women of
this world,  as the world terms honesty,
 but he had received the death-blow
to his every hope. So he had lost her
altogether,  he who had watched and
waited; who had served and followed,
in season and out of season; who had
been the faithful friend, keeping his eye
fixed only upon her happiness; who had
given all; who had poured out his heart
like water, and his life like wine, before
her!
	At first all he thought of was that
Philip dAvranche was the husband of
the woman he loved, and that Philip had
deserted her. Then a remembrance
stunned him: Prince Philip dAvranche,
Duc de Bercy, had another wife! He
remembered  it had been burned into
his brain the day he saw it first in the
Gazette de Jersey  that he had mar-
ried the Comtesse Chantavoine, niece of
the Marquis Graudjon-Larisse, upon the
very day, and but an hour before, the old
Duc de Bercy suddenly died. It flashed
across his mind now what he had felt
then. He had always believed that Phil-
ip had wronged Guida; and long ago he
would have gone in search of him,
gone to try the strength of his arm against
this cowardly marauder, as he held him,
 but his fathers ill health had kept
him where he was, and Philip, too, was</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00410" SEQ="0410" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="404">	404	The Battle of the Strong.
at sea upon the nations business. So
the years had gone on until now.
	His brain soon cleared. All that he
had ever thought .upon the matter now
crystallized itself into the very truth of
the affair. Philip had married Guida
secretly; but his new future had opened
up to him all at once, and he had mar-
ried again,  a crime, but a crime which
in high places sometimes goes unpun-
ished. Yet how monstrous it was that
such vile wickedness should be delivered
against this woman before him, in whom
beauty, goodness, power, were commin-
gled! She was the real Princess Philip
dAvranche, and this child of hers 
Ah, now he understood why she allowed
the child to speak no patois!
	They scarcely knew how long they
stood silent: she with her hand stroking
the childs golden hair; he white and
dazed, looking  looking at her and the
child, as the thing resolved itself to him.
At last, in a voice which neither he nor
she could quite recognize as his own, he
said, Of course you live now only for
the child.
	How she thanked him in her heart
for the things lie had left unsaid,  those
things which clear-minded and great-
minded folk, high or humble, always un-
derstand! There was no selfish lament-
ing upon his part; there were no re-
proaches, none of the futile banalities
of the lover who fails to see that it is no
crime for a woman not to love him. The
thing he had said was the thing she most
cared to hear.
	Only for that, Ranulph, she an-
swered.
	When will you claim the childs
rights?
	She shook her head sadly. I do not
know, she replied, with hesitation. I
will tell you all about it, she added
hastily.
	Then she told him of the lost register
of St. Michaels and of the Reverend
Lorenzo Dow, but she said nothing as to
why she had kept silence. She felt that,
man though he was, he might divine
something of the truth. In any ease he
knew that Philip had deserted her.
	After a moment he said, I II find
Mr. Dow if he is alive, and the register
too. Then the boy shall have his rights
at once.~~
	No, Ranuiph, she answered firmly,
it shall be in my own time. I must
keep the child with me. I know not
when I shall speak,  I am biding the
day. Once I thought I never should
speak, but then I did not see all,  did
not wholly realize my duty toward Guil-
bert. It is so hard to do what is wise
and just.
	When the proofs are found, your
child shall have his rights, he contin-
ued, with grim insistence.
	I would never let him go from me,
she said, and, leaning over, she impul-
sively clasped the little Guilbert in her
arms.
	Therell be no need for the child
to go from you, he rejoined; for
when your rights come to you, Philip
dAvranche will not be living.
	Will not be living! she cried in
amazement. She did not understand at
first.
	I mean to kill him, he replied
sternly.
	She started violently, and the light of
anger leaped into her eyes. You mean
to kill Philip dAvranche,  you, Maitre
Ranulph Delagarde! she said. Whom
has he wronged? Myself and my child
only,  his wife and his child. Men
have been killed for lesser wrongs, but
the right to kill does not belong to you.
You speak of killing Philip dAvranche,
and yet you dare to say you are my
friend !
	In that moment Ranulph learned more
than he had ever guessed of lifes subtle
distinctions and the workings of a wo-
mans mind; and he also knew that she
was right. Her father, her grandfather,
might have killed Philip dAvranche,
 any one but himself, he the man who</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00411" SEQ="0411" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="405">	The Battle of the Strong.	405
had but just declared his love for her.
Clearly his selfishness had blinded him.
Right was on his side, but not the formal
codes by which men live. He could not
avenge Guidas wrongs upon her hus-
band, for all men knew that he had loved
her for years.
	Forgive me, he said in a low tone;
you are right. But you will let me
help you in those other things, to have
justice for your child?
	You see you can do that for me,
Ranulph, she answered gently.
	A new thought came to him. Do you
think your not speaking all these years
was best for the child? he asked.
Her lips trembled. Oh, that thought,
she said, that thought has made me un-
happy so often! It comes to me some-
times at night, as I lie sleepless, and I
wonder if my boy will grow up and turn
against me one day. Yet I did what I
thought was right, Ranulph,  I did the
only thing I could do. I would rather
have died than 
She stopped short. No, not even to
this man who knew all could she speak her
whole mind, but sometimes the thought
came to her with horrifying acuteness:
was it possible that she ought to have
sunk her own disillusions, misery, con-
tempt, and hatred of Philip dAvranche,
for the childs sake? She shuddered
even now as the reflection of that possi-
bility caine to her!
	Of late she had felt that a crisis was
near. She had had premonitions that
her fate, whatever it was, was closing
in upon her; that these days in this
lonely spot with Guilbert, with her love
for him and his love for her, were num-
bered; that dreams must soon give way
to action, ~nd this devoted peace would
be broken, she knew not how.
	Stooping, she kissed the little fellow
upon the forehead and upon the eyes,
and his hands came up and clasped her
cheeks.
	Tu maimes, maman? he asked.
She had taught him the pretty question.
	Comme la vie, comme la vie! she
answered, with a half-sob, and drew him
from his chair to her bosom.
	Now she looked toward the window.
Ranulph followed the look, and saw that
the shades of night were falling.
	I have far to walk, he said; I
must be going.
	As he held out his hand to Guida the
child leaned over and touched him on
the shoulder. What is your name,
man? he asked.
	Ranulph smiled, and, taking the warm
little hand in his own, he said, My
name is Ranulph, little gentleman, but
you shall call me Ho.
	Good-night, Ho  man, the child
answered, with the same mischievous
smile that had once belonged to Guida.
	The scene brought up another such
scene in Guidas life, so many years ago.
Instinctively she drew back, a look of
pain crossing her face. But Ranulph
did not see; he was going. At the door-
way he turned, and said, You may trust
me.
	Guida did not answer in words, but
she nodded and smiled, saying more
plainly than words could say, You are
a good man, Ranulph.


XXXI.

	When Ranulph returned to his little
house at St. Aubins Bay night had
fallen. Approaching it, he saw that there
was no light in the windows, that the
blinds were not drawn, that there was no
glimmer of a fire in the chimney. He
hesitated at the door, for he instinctive-
ly felt that something must have hap-
pened to his father. He was just about
to enter, however, when some one came
hurriedly round the corner of the house.
	Whist, boy! said a voice. I ye
news for you. Ranulph recognized the
voice as that of Dormy Jamais. Dormy
plucked at his sleeve. Come with me,
boy!</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00412" SEQ="0412" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="406">	4043	The Battle of the Strong.
	No, no; come inside, if you want to
tell me something, returned Ranuiph.
	Ah bah, not for me! Stone walls
have ears. I 11 tell you and the wind
that hears and runs away.
	I must speak to my father first, an-
swered Ranulph.
	Then come with me. I ye got him
safe! Dormy chuckled to himself.
	Ranulphs heavy hand dropped on his
shoulder. What s that you re saying,
 my father with you? What s the
matter?
	As though oblivious of Ranulphs hand
iDormy went on chuckling.
	Whoever burns me for a fool will
lose their ashes. Des monz k fous,  I
have a head! Come with me.
	Ranulph saw that he must humor the
shrewd natural, so he said, Et ben,
put your four shirts in five bundles and
come along. He was a true Jerseyman
at heart, and speaking to such as Dor-
my Jamais he used the homely patois
phrases. He knew there was no use
hurrying the little man; he would take
his own time.
	There s been the devil to pay!
said Dormy, as he ran toward the shore,
his sabots going elac - clac, clac . clac.
There s been the devil to pay in St.
Heliers, boy! He spoke scarcely
above a whisper.
	Tch~che  what s that? said Ra-
nulph.
	But Dormy was not to uncover his pot
of roses till bis own time.
	That conn~table s got no more wit
than a square-bladed knife! he rattled
on. But gache-l~-penn, I in hungry!
And as he ran he began munching a
lump of bread he took from his pocket.
	For the next five minutes they went
on in silence. It was quite dark, and
as they passed up Market Hill  called
Ghost Lane because of the Good Little
People who made it their highway 
Dormy caught hold of Ranulphs coat
and trotted along beside him. As they
went up the hill, tokens of the life with-
in came out to them through doorway
and window. Now it was the voice of
a laughing young mother:
Si tu as faim
Manges ta main
lIt gardes lautre pour demain;
Et ta tote
Pour le jour de fete;
Et ton gros ort~e
	Pour le Jour Saint Norb~.
And again: 
Let us pluck the bill of the lark,
The lark from head to tail.

	Ranulph knew the voice. It was that
of a young wife of the parish of St. Sa-
viour: married happily; living simply;
given a frugal board, simple clothing af-
ter the manner of her kind, and a com-
radeship for life. For the moment he
felt little but sorrow for himself. The
world seemed to be conspiring against
him: the chorus of Fate was singing be-
hind the scenes,  singing of the happi-
ness of others in sardonic comment on
his own final unhappiness; yet despite
the pain of finality he felt something also
of the apathy of despair.
	From another doorway came frag-
ments of a song sung at a veille. The
door was open, and he could see within
the happy gathering of lads and lasses.
There was the spacious kitchen, its
beams and rafters dark with age, adorned
with flitches of bacon, huge loaves rest-
ing in the raclyi beneath the centre
beam, the broad open hearth, the flam-
ing fire of logs, and the great brass pan,
shining like freshly coined gold, on its
iron tripod over the logs. There were
the lasses, in their short woolen petti-
coats, close caps, and bedg6nes of blue
and lilac; the lads stirring with all their
might the contents of the vast bashin,
 many cabots of apples, together with
sugar, lemon-peel, and cider; the old
ladies, in mob-caps tied under the chin,
measuring out the nutmeg and cinnamon
by the light of the crasset, to complete
the making of the black butter,  a joc-
und recreation for all, and at all times.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00413" SEQ="0413" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="407">	The Battle of the Strong.	407

	In a corner was a fiddler, and on the
veille, flourished for the occasion with
flowers and ferns, sat two centeniers and
the pr~v6t, singing an old song of the
veilles in the patois of three parishes.
	Ranulph looked at the scene linger-
ingly. Here he was, with mystery and
peril to hasten his steps, loitering at the
spot where the light of home streamed
out upon the roadway. But though he
loitered, somehow he seemed withdrawn
from all these things; they were to him
now almost like a picture of a distant
past.
	iDormy plucked at his coat. Come,
come, lift your feet, lift your feet, said
he; it s no time to walk in slippers.
The old man will be getting scared, oul-
gia!
	Ranulph roused himself. Yes, yes, he
must hurry on. He had not forgotten
his father, but something had held him
here a moment,  as though Fate had
whispered in his ear, What does it
matter now? While yet you may, feed
on the sight of happiness. Just so, the
prisoner going to execution seizes one of
the few moments left to him for prayer,
to look lingeringly upon what he leaves,
as though to carry into thedark a clear
remembrance of it all.
	Moving on quietly in a kind of dream,
Ranulph was roused again by Dormys
voice: On Sunday I saw three mag-
pies, and there was a wedding that day.
Tuesday I saw two, which is for joy,
and that day fifty Jersey prisoners of
the French comes back on Jersey. This
morning one I saw. One magpie is for
trouble, and trouble s here. One does nt
have eyes for naught,  no, bidemme!
	Ranulphs patience was exhausted. He
would no longer ask for Dormys news;
he would question if he had any.
	Bachouar! he exclaimed rough-
ly, you make elephants out of fleas.
You ye got no more news than a conch
shell has music, and when I ye got to the
end of this you shall have a backhander
that 11 put you to sleep, Maitre Dormy!
	If he had been asked politely, Dormy
would have been still more cunningly
reticent. To abuse him in his own ar-
got was to make him loose his bag of
mice in a flash.
	Bachouar yourself, Maitre Ranulph!
You 11 find out soon. No news  no
trouble eh! Par mad~, Mattingley s
gone to the Vier Prison  he! The
baker s come back, and the conn~table s
after Olivier Delagarde! No trouble,
pardingue! If no trouble, Dormy Jar.
mais 5 a bat dla goule, and no need for
father of you to hide in a place that only
Dormy Jamais knows  my good!
	So at last the blow had fallen,  after
all these years of silence, sacrifice, and
misery. The futility of all that he had
done and suffered for his fathers sake
came home to Ranulph. Yet his brain
was instantly alive. He questioned Dor-
my rapidly and adroitly, and got the
story from him in patches.
	The baker, who, with Olivier Dela-
garde, had betrayed the country into the
hands of Rullecour, had been captured,
with a French confederate of Matting-
leys, in attempting to steal Jean Ton-
zels boat, the Hardi Biaou. The con-
federate had been mortally wounded at
the capture. Before he died he impli-
cated Mattingley in several robberies,
and in one well-known case of piracy of
three months before, committed within
gunshot of the men-of-war lying in the
tideway. The baker, seriously wound-
ed, confessed to his crime, having been
promised his life on condition that he
disclosed the name of the ringleader in
the treason which enabled Rullecour to
land. He had straightway named Oh-
vier Delagarde. After the capture, the
prisoner bad been carried to the court-
house and examined in private.
	Hidden behind the great chair of the
lieutenant-bailly himself, Dormy Jamais
had heard the whole business. This had
brought him hot-foot to St. Aubins Bay,
whence he had hurried Olivier Delagarde
to a hiding-place in the hills above the</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00414" SEQ="0414" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="408">	408	The Battle of the Strong.

bay of St. Brelade. The fool had tra-
veled more swiftly than Jersey justice,
whose feet are heavy. Elie Matting-
ley and the baker were now in the Vier
Prison. There was the whole story.
	For fifteen years and more Ranulph
Delagarde had been called a hero; his
father, a hero and a patriot,  a figure
of ancient loyalty that more than all else
recalled the time when Pierson defeated
Rullecour. It was but yesterday, as it
were, that they had offered to make Ra-
nuiph conn&#38; able of St. Heliers. The
mask had fallen, the game was up.
Well, at least there would be no more
hiding, no more lying, no more inward
shame greater than outward obloquy.
All at once it appeared to him madness
that he had not taken his father away
from Jersey long ago,  that he should
have thus awaited here this inevitable
hour.
	Little good, however, could come of re-
pining or lamenting. Nothing now was
left but action. He must save his father;
it was his duty and his right. Some
men had yielded up their Sons to the
sword of justice, but what son could so
yield up his father?  as though it were
that he who begot might destroy, but he
who was begotten must only save!
	Walking fiercely on, thinking only of
how he might save his father, he was
conscious that the blizard beside him was
munching bread and apples with idle en-
joyment. There came to his mind sud-
denly the scene of fifteen years before,
when, locked and barred in the bakers
shop, he had heard the clcw-clac, clac-
ekw, of Dormys sabots go by the door-
way.
	He must get his father clear of the
island, and that soon. But how? and
where should they go? He had a boat
in St. Aubins Bay; getting there un-
der cover of darkness, he might embark
with his father and set sail  whither?
To Sark? There was no safety there.
To Guernsey? That was no better. To
England? He might join the English
navy, of course,  he had been three
years a gunner at Elizabeth Castle.
No, not that; for in the navy he should
meet with Philip dAvranche, and if
they two met he might forget the pro-
mise he had made to Guida. To France?
That was it,  to the war of the Yen-
d6e, to join D6tricand, Comte D~tri-
cand de Tournay. No need to find the
scrap of paper D6tricand had given him
once in the Vier Marchi. Wherever he
might be, his great fame would be the
highway to him. All France knew of
the companion of La Rochejaquelein, the
fearless D6tricand de Tournay. Since in
Jersey there was no longer a place for
himself, shamed and dishonored, convict-
ed of complicity in hiding his fathers
crime, fighting now in that holy war he
would find something to kill thought, to
take him out of life without disgrace.
France,  his fate awaited him in
France. But there was his father still!
Well, he would take his father with him
to France, and bide his fate.
	By the time his mind was thus made
up, they had reached the rocky point
dividing Portelet Bay from St. Bre-
lades,  a lonely headland, not unlike
that of Plemont at the north. Dark
things were said of this spot, and the
folk of the island were wont to avoid
it. It had its ghostly lights, its pirates
caves, and all the mise-en-scbne of crim-
inal privacy. That strange lights were
seen was undoubted. Beneath the cliffs
in the sea was a rocky islet called Jan-
vrins Tomb. Here one Janvrin, ill of
a fell disease, and with his fellows for-
bidden by the Royal Court to land, had
taken refuge, and here died, wholly neg-
lected and without burial. Afterward
his body had lain exposed till the ravens
and vultures picked the bones, and at last
a great storm swept them off into the sea.
Strange lights were to be seen by this
rock, and though wise men guessed them
mortal glimmerings, easily explained,
they sufficed to give the headland immu-
nity from invasion.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00415" SEQ="0415" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="409">	The Battle of the Strong.	409
	Here it was that Dormy Jamais had
brought the trembling Olivier Dela-
garde, whimpering and senile, unrepent-
ing and peevish, but with a craven fear
of the Royal Court and a furious popu-
lace quickening his footsteps. Ranulph
reached the cave which was his fathers
hiding-place5 through the seemingly im-
possible entrance of another and larger
cave. It was like a little vaulted cha-
pel, floored with sand and shingle. A
crevice through rock and earth to the
world above let in the light, and let out
the smoke. Only the highest tide in the
year entered this retreat.
	Here Olivier Delagarde sat crouched
over a tiny fire, with some bread and a
jar of water at his hand, gesticulating
and talking to himself. The long white
hair and beard, with the benevolent f ore-
head, gave him the look of some latter-
day St. Helier grieving for the sins and
praying for the sorrows of mankind; but
from the hateful mouth came infamous
profanity, fit only for the dreadful com-
munion of a Witches Sabbath.
	When he heard Ranulph and Dormy
entering the cave, he cowered and shiv-
ered in terror; but Ranuiph, who knew
too well his disgusting cowardice, called
to him reassuringly. He quieted a lit-
tle, but went on muttering to himself. As
Ranulph approached, he stretched out
his talon-like fingers in a gesture of en-
treaty.
	You 11 not let them hang me, Ba-
nuiph,  you 11 save me? he said.
	Dont be afraid; they shall not hang
you, Ranulph replied quietly, and be-
gan warming his hands at the fire; for,
though it was but early autumn, the cave
was cold.
	You II  you 11 swear it, Ra-
nulph?
	I ye told you they shall not hang
you. You ought to know by this time
whether I mean what I say, his son an-
swered, more sharply.
	Assuredly Ranulph meant that his f a-
ther should not be hanged. Whatever
the law was, whatever wrong the old
man had done, it had been atoned for;
the price had been paid by both. He
himself had drunk the cup of shame to
the dregs, but now he would not swallow
the. dregs. An iron determination en-
tered into him. He had endured all
that he would endure from man. He
had set out to defend Olivier Delagarde
from the worst that might happen, and
he was ready now to do so to the bitter
end. His scheme of justice might not
be that of the Royal Court, but he would
defend it with his life. He had sudden-
ly grown hard  and dangerous.


XXXII.

	The Royal Court was sitting late.
Candles had been brought to light the
long desk, or dais, where sat the lieu-
tenant-bailly in his great chair, with six
scarlet-robed jurats on either side of
him. The attorneygeneral stood at his
desk, mechanically scanning the indict-
ment read against prisoners charged
with capital crimes. His work was
over, and, according to his lights, he had
done it well. Not even the undertakers
apprentice could have been less sensitive
to the struggles of humanity under the
heel of fate and death. A little plain-
tive complacency joined to a righteous
austerity and an agreeable expression
of hunger made the attorney-general a
figure in godly contrast to the prisoner
awaiting~his doom in the iron cage op-
posite.
	There was a singular stillness in this
sombre Royal Court, where only a tal-
low candle or two and a dim lanthorn
near the door filled the room with flick-
ering shadows,  great heads upon the
wall drawing close together, and vast
lips murmuring awful secrets. Low
whisperings came through the dusk, like
mournful night-winds carrying tales of
awe through a heavy forest. Once in the
long silence a figure rose up, and, stealing</PB>

across the room to a door near the jury-
box, tapped upon it with a pencil. A
moments pause, and the door opened
slightly, and another shadowy figure ap-
peared, whispered, and vanished. Then
the first figure closed the door again
quietly, and came and spoke softly up
to the lieutenant-bailly, who yawned in
his hand, sat back in his chair, and
drummed with his fingers upon the arm.
Thereupon the other  the greffier of
the court  settled down at his desk be-
neath the jurats, and peered into an open
book before him, his eyes close to the
page, reading silently by the meagre light
of a candle from the jurats desk behind
him.
	Now a fat and ponderous avocat rose
up and was about to speak; but the lieu-
tenant - bailly, with a peevish gesture,
waved him down, and he settled heavily
into place again.
	At last the door at which the greffler
had tapped opened, and a gaunt figure
in a red robe came out, and, standing in
the middle of the room, motioned to the
great pew opposite the attorney-general.
Slowly the twenty-five men of the grand
jury following him filed into place, and
sat themselves down in the shadows.
Then the gaunt figure, bowing to the lieu-
tenant - bailly and the jurats, went over
and took his seat beside the attorney-
general. Whereupon the bailly leaned
forward and droned a question to the
grand enqu~te in the shadow. Then one
rose from among the twenty-five, and out
of the dusk there came a piping voice in
rcply to the judge 
	We find the prisoner at the bar
more guilty than innocent.
	A shudder ran through the court.
But some one not in the room shuddered
still more violently; for at the gable
window of a house in the Rue des Tr~s
Pigeons a girl had sat the livelong day,
looking,  looking into the court-room.
She had watched the day decline, the
evening come, and the lighting of the
crasset, and had waited to hear the words
that meant more to her than her own
life. At last the great moment came,
and she could hear the voice of the fore-
man of the grand enqu~te whining the
fateful words, 3fore guilty than inno-
cent.
	It was Carterette Mattingley, and the
prisoner at the bar was her father. Not
far from Mattingley sat the chief witness
against him, Carcaud, the baker, who,
with Olivier Delagarde, had betrayed his
country, and had now turned Kings evi-
dence.
	Carterette did not wait to see the fig-
ure issue from the barbarous iron cage
grimly recalling the days of Bernal Diaz
del Castillo, nor to see the twelve jurats
put on their hats to hear the lieuten-
ant - bailly pass sentence of death upon
her father. She had other work to do.
Even as Ranulph had declared that his
father should not be hanged, in like man-
ner she had made a vow. He had so
far kept his word, and she would keep
hers. She knew more concerning the
Vier Prison than did the judges of the
Royal Court  and she had laid her
plans.

BISMAROK.

	ONE by one the nations of the world
come to their own, have free play for
their faculties, express themselves, and
eventually pass onward into silence. Our
age has beheld the elevation of Prussia.
Well may we ask, What has been her
message? What the path by which she
climbed into preeminence? That she
would reach the summit, the work of
Frederick the Great in the last century,
and of Stein at the beginning of this,
portended. It has been Bisinarcks mis-
sion to amplify and complete their task.
Through him Prussia has come to her
own. What, then, does she express?
	The Prussians have excelled even the
Romans in the art of turning men into
machines. Set a Yankee down before a
heap of coal and another of iron, and he
will not rest until he has changed them
into an implement to save the labor of
many hands; the Prussian takes flesh and
blood, and the will-power latent there-
in, and converts them into a machine.
Such soldiers, such government clerks,
such administrators, have never been
manufactured elsewhere. Methodical,
punctilious, thorough, are those officers
and officials. The government which
makes them relies not on sudden spurts,
but on the cumulative force of habit.
It substitutes rule for whim; it sup-
presses individual spontaneity, unless
this can be transformed into energy for
the great machine to use. That Prussian
system takes a turnip-fed peasant, and
in a few months makes of him a military
weapon, the length of whose stride is
prescribed in centimetres,  a machine
which presents arms to a passing lieuten-
ant with as much gravity and precision
as if the fate of Prussia hinged on that
special act. It takes the average trades-
man 5 son, puts him into the education-
al mill, and brings him out a professor,
 equipped even to the spectacles,  a
nonpareil of knowledge, who fastens on
some subject, great or small, timely or re-
mote, with the dispassionate persistence
of a leech; and who, after many years,
revolutionizes our theory of Greek roots,
or of microbes, or of religion. Patient
and noiseless as the earthworm, this

BISMAROK.

	ONE by one the nations of the world
come to their own, have free play for
their faculties, express themselves, and
eventually pass onward into silence. Our
age has beheld the elevation of Prussia.
Well may we ask, What has been her
message? What the path by which she
climbed into preeminence? That she
would reach the summit, the work of
Frederick the Great in the last century,
and of Stein at the beginning of this,
portended. It has been Bisinarcks mis-
sion to amplify and complete their task.
Through him Prussia has come to her
own. What, then, does she express?
	The Prussians have excelled even the
Romans in the art of turning men into
machines. Set a Yankee down before a
heap of coal and another of iron, and he
will not rest until he has changed them
into an implement to save the labor of
many hands; the Prussian takes flesh and
blood, and the will-power latent there-
in, and converts them into a machine.
Such soldiers, such government clerks,
such administrators, have never been
manufactured elsewhere. Methodical,
punctilious, thorough, are those officers
and officials. The government which
makes them relies not on sudden spurts,
but on the cumulative force of habit.
It substitutes rule for whim; it sup-
presses individual spontaneity, unless
this can be transformed into energy for
the great machine to use. That Prussian
system takes a turnip-fed peasant, and
in a few months makes of him a military
weapon, the length of whose stride is
prescribed in centimetres,  a machine
which presents arms to a passing lieuten-
ant with as much gravity and precision
as if the fate of Prussia hinged on that
special act. It takes the average trades-
man 5 son, puts him into the education-
al mill, and brings him out a professor,
 equipped even to the spectacles,  a
nonpareil of knowledge, who fastens on
some subject, great or small, timely or re-
mote, with the dispassionate persistence
of a leech; and who, after many years,
revolutionizes our theory of Greek roots,
or of microbes, or of religion. Patient
and noiseless as the earthworm, this
scholar accomplishes a similarly incal-
culable work.
	A spirit of obedience, which on its
upper side passes into deference not al-
ways disting~iishable from servility, and
on its lower side is not always free from
arrogance, lies at the bottom of the Prus-
sian nature. Except in India, caste has
nowhere had more power. The Prus-
sian does not chafe at social inequality,
but he cannot endure social uncertainty;
he must know where he stands, if it be
only on the bootblacks level. The sat-
isfaction he gets from requiring from
those below him every scrape and nod
of deference proper to his position more
than compensates him for the deference

sification is carried to the fraction of an
inch. Everybody, be he privy councilor
or chimney-sweep, is known by his office.

amuses foreigners, enables the Prussian
to lift his hat at the height appropriate

man  rarely exists; for a gentleman
cannot be made by the rank he holds,
which is external, but only by qualities
within himself.
	Nevertheless, these Prussians  so un-
sympathetic and rude compared with
their kinsmen in the south and along
the Rhine, not to speak of races more
amiable still  kept down to our own
time a strength and tenacity of charac-
ter that intercourse with Western Euro-
peans scarcely affected. Frederick the
Great tried to graft on them the polished
arts and the grace of the French: he
might as well have decorated the granite
faces of his fortresses with dainty Paris-
ian wall-paper. But when he touched
the dominant chord of his race,  its
aptitude for system,  he had a large
response. The genuine Prussian nature
embodied itself in the army, in the bu-
reaucracy, in state education, through all
of which its astonishing talent for rules
found congenial exercise. One dissipa-
tion, indeed, the Prussians allowed them-
selves, earlier in this century,  they re-
veled in Hegelianism. But even here
they were true to their instinct; for the
philosophy of Hegel commended itself to
them because it assumed to reduce the
universe to a system, and to pigeonhole
God himself.
	We see, then, the elements out of
which Prussia grew to be a strong state,
not yet large in population, but compact
and carefully organized. Let us look
now at Germany, of which she formed
a part.
	We are struck at once by the fact
that until 1871 Germany had no politi-
cal unity. During the centuries when
France, England, and Spain were being
welded into political units by their re-
spective dynasties, the great Teutonic
race in Central Europe escaped the uni-
fying process. The Holy Roman Em-
pire  at best a reminiscence  was too
weak to prevent the rise of many petty
princedoms and duchies and of a few
large states, whose rulers were heredi
tary, whereas the emperor was elective.
Thus particularism  what we might
call states rights  flourished, to the
detriment of national union. At the
end of the last century, Germany had
four hundred independent sovereigns:
the most powerful being the King of
Prussia; the weakest, some knight whose
realm embraced but a few hundred acres,
or some free city whose jurisdiction was
bounded by its walls. When Napoleon,
the great simplifier, reduced the number
of little German states, he had no idea
of encouraging the formation of a strong,
coherent German Empire. To guard
against this, which might menace the
supremacy of France, he created the
kingdoms of Bavaria and Westphalia,
and set up the Confederation of the
Rhine. After his downfall the Ger-
man Confederation was organized,  a
weak institution, consisting of thirty-
nine members, whose common affairs
were regulated by a Diet which sat at
Frankfort. Representation in this Diet
was so unequal that Austria and Prus-
sia, with forty-two million inhabitants,
had only one eighth of the votes, while
the small states, with but twelve million
inhabitants, had seven eighths. Four
tiny principalities, with two hundred and
fifty thousand inhabitants each, could
exactly offset Prussia with eight mil-
lions. By a similar anomaly, Nevada
and New York have an equal represen-
tation in the United States Senate.
	From 1816 to 1848 Austria ruled the
Diet. Yet Austria was herself an inter-
loper in any combination of German
states, for her German subjects, through
whom she gained admission to the Diet,
numbered only four millions; but her
prestige was augmented by the backing
of her thirty million. non-German sub-
jects besides. Prussia fretted at this
Austrian supremacy, fretted, and could
not counteract it. Beside the Confed-
eration, which so loosely bound the Ger-
man particularists together, there was a
Customs Union, which, though simply</PB>

commercial, fostered among the Ger~
mans the idea of common interests.
The spirit of nationality, potent every-
where, awakened also in the Germans a
vision of political unity, but for the most
part those who beheld the vision were
unpractical; the men of action, the
rulers, opposed a scheme which enfolded
among its possibilities the curtailing of
their autocracy through the adoption
of constitutional government. INo state
held more rigidly than Prussia the tenets
of absolutism.
	Great, therefore, was the general sur-
prise, and among Liberals the joy, at
the announcement, in February, 1847,
that the King of Prussia had consented
to the creation of a Prussian Parlia-
ixient. He granted to it hardly more
power than would suffice for it to as-
semble and adjourn; but even this, to
the Liberals, thirsty for a constitution,
was as the first premonitory raindrops
after a long drought. Among the mem-
bers of this Parliament, or Diet, was a
tall, slim, blond-bearded, massive-head-
ed Brandenburger, thirty-two years old,
who sat as proxy for a country gentle-
man. A few of his colleagues recognized
him as Otto von Bismarck; the majority
had never heard of him.
	Bismarek was born at Schtsnhausen,
Prussia, April 1, 1815. His paternal
ancestors had been soldiers back to the
time when they helped to defend the
Brandenburg March against the inroads
of Slav barbarians. His mother was
the daughter of an employee in Fred-
erick the Greats War Office. Thus, on
both sides his roots were struck in true
Prussian soil. At the age of six he was
placed in a Berlin boarding - school, of
which he afterward ridiculed the spu-
rious Spartanism; at twelve he en-
tered a gymnasium, where for five
years he pursued the usual course of
studies,  an average scholar, but al-
ready noteworthy for his fine physique;
at seventeen he went up to the Univer-
sity at G~ittingen. In the life of a
413
Prussian, there is but one period be-
tween the cradle and the grave during
which he escapes the restraints of iron-
grooved routine: that period comprises
the years he spends at the university.
There a strange license is accorded him.
By day he swaggers through the streets,
leering at the women and affronting the
men; by night he carouses. And from
time to time he varies the monotony of
drinking-bouts by a duel. Such, at least;
was the life of the university student in
Bismareks time. At Gdttingen, and
subsequently at Berlin, he had the repu-
tation of being the greatest beer-drinker
and the fiercest fighter; yet he must
also have studied somewhat, for in due
time he received his degree in law, and
became official reporter in one of the
Berlin courts. Then he served as refer-
endary at Aix-la-Chapelle, and passed a
year in military service.
	At twenty-four he set about recuper-
ating the family fortunes, which had
suffered through his fathers incompe-
tence. He took charge of the estates,
devoted himself to agriculture, and was
known for many miles round as the mad
squire. Tales of his revels at his coun-
try house, of his wild pranks and prac-
tical jokes, horrified the neighborhood.
Yet here, again, his recklessness did not
preclude good results. He made the
lands pay, and he tamed into usefulness
that restless animal, his body, which was
to serve as mount for his mighty soul.
Some biographers, referring to his bu-
colic apprenticeship, have compared him
to Cromwell; in his youthful roistering
he reminds us of Mirabean.
	To the Diet of 1847 the mad squire
came, and during several sittings he held
his peace. At last, however, when a Lib-
eral deputy declared that Prussia had
risen in arms in 1813, in the hope of get-
ting a constitution quite as much as of
expelling the French, the blond Branden-
burger got leave to speak. In a voice
which seemed incongruously small for his
stature, but which carried far and pro-</PB>

duced the effect of being the utterance
of an inflexible will, he deprecated the
assertions just made, and declared that
the desire to shake off foreign tyranny
was a sufficient motive for the uprising
in 1813. These words set the House in
confusion. Liberal deputies hissed and
shouted so that Bismarck could not go
on; but, nothing daunted, he took a
newspaper out of his pocket and read it,
there in the tribune, till order was re-
stored. Then, having added that who-
ever deemed that motive inadequate held
Prussias honor cheap, he strode haugh-
tily to his seat, amid renewed jeers and
clamor. Such was Bismarcks parlia-
inentary baptism of fire.
	Before the session adjourned, the depu-
ties had come to know him well. They
discovered that the mad squire, the blunt
captain of the dykes, was doubly re-
doubtable; he had strong opinions, and
utter fearlessness in proclaiming them.
	His political creeds was short,it
comprised but two clauses: I believe
in the supremacy of Prussia, and in ab-
solute monarchy. More royalist than
the King, he opposed every concession
which might diminish by a hairs breadth
the royal prerogative. Constitutional
government, popular representation,
whatever Liberals had been struggling
and dying for since 1789, he detested.
Democracy, and especially German de-
mocracy, he scoffed at. For sixty years
reformers had been railing at the absurd-
ities of the old r6gime; they had de-
nounced the injustice of the privileged
classes; they had made odious the tyr-
anny of paternalism. Bismarck entered
the lists as the champion of divine
right, and first proved his strength by
exposing the defects of democracy.
	Those who believe most firmly in de-
mocracy acknowledge, nevertheless, that
it has many objections, both in theory
and in practice. Universal suffrage 
the abandoning of the state to the caprice
of millions of voters, among whom the
proportion of intelligence to ignorance is
as one to ten  seems a process worthy
of Bedlam. The ballot - box is hardly
more accurate than the dice - box, as a
test of the fitness of candidates. Popu-
lar government means party government,
and parties are dogmatic, overbearing,
insincere, and corrupt. The men who
legislate and administer, chosen by this
method, avowedly serve their party, and
not the state; and though, by chance,
they should be both skillful and honest,
they may be overturned by a sudden re-
vulsion of the popular will. Such a sys-
tem breeds a class of professional poli-
ticians,  men who make a business of
getting into office, and whose only re-
commendation is their proficiency in the
art of cajoling voters. A government
should be managed as a great business cor-
poration is managed: it has to deal with
the weightiest problems of finance, and
with delicate diplomatic questions, for
which the trained efforts of judicious ex-
perts are needed; but instead of being
entrusted to them, it is given over to poli-
ticians elected by multitudes who cannot
even conduct their private business suc-
cessfully, much less entertain large and
patriotic views of the common welfare.
To decide an election by a show of hands
seems not a whit less absurd than to de-
cide it by the aggregate weight or the
color of the hair of the voters. We
speak of the will of the majority as if it
were infallibly right. The vast majority
of men to-day would vote that the sun
revolves round the earth: should this
belief of a million ignoramuses counter-
vail the knowledge of one astronomer?
Shall knowledge be the test of fitness in
all concerns except government, the most
critical, the most far reaching and re-
sponsible of all? Majority rule substi-
tutes mere numbers, bulk, and quantity
for quality. Putting a saddle on Intelli-
gence, it bids Ignorance mount and ride
whither it will,  even to the devil. It
is the dupe of its own folly; for the poli-
ticians whom it chooses turn out to be,
not the representatives of the people,</PB>

but the attorneys of some mill or mine or
railway.
	These and similar objections to de-
mocracy Bismarck urged with a sarcasm
and directness hitherto unknown in
German politics. When half the world
was repeating the words Liberalism,
Constitution, Equality,  as if the
words themselves possessed magic to re-
generate society,  he insisted that firm
nations must be based upon facts, not
phrases. He had the twofold advan-
tage of invariably separating the actual
from the apparent, and of being opposed
by the most incompetent Liberals in Eu-
rope. However noble the ideals of the
German reformers, the men themselves
were singularly incapable of dealing with
realities. Nor should this surprise us;
for they had but recently broken away
from the machine we have described, and
they had not yet a new machine to work
in; so they whirled to and fro in v~he-
ment confusion, the very rigidity of their
previous restraint increasing their dog-
matism and their discord.
	The revolution of 1848 soon put them
to the ordeal. The German Liberals
aimed at national unity under a constitu-
tion. Like their brothers in Austria and
Italy, they enjoyed a temporary triumph;
but they could not construct. Their Par-
liament became a cave of the winds.
Their schemes clashed. By the begin.
ning of 1850 the old order was restored.
	During this stormy crisis, Bismarck, as
deputy in two successive Diets, had re-
solutely withstood the popular tide. He
regarded the revolutionists as men in
whom the qualities of knave, fool, and
maniac alternately ruled; the revolution
itself, lie said, had no other motive than
a lust of theft. One of its leaders
he dismissed as a phrase-watering-pot.
The right of assemblages he ridiculed as
furnishing democracy with bellows; a
free press he stigmatized as a blood-poi-
soner. When the imperial crown was
offered to the King of Prussia, Bismarck
argued against accepting it; he would
not see his King degraded to the level
of a mere paper president.
	Such opposition would have made the
speaker conspicuous, if only for its au-
dacity. His enemies had learned, how-
ever, that it required a strong character
to support that audacity continuously.
They tried to silence him with abuse;
but their abuse, like tar, added fuel to
his fire. They tried ridicule; but their
ridicule had too much of the German
dullness to wound him. They called him
a bigoted Junker, or squire. Remem-
ber, he retorted, that the names Whig
and Tory were first used opprobriously,
and be assured that we will yet bring the
name Junker into respect and honor.~~
Many anecdotes are told illustrating his
quick repulse of intended insult or his
disregard of formality. He was not un-
willing that his enemies should remem-
ber that he held his superior physical
strength in reserve, if his arguments
failed. Yet on a hunting-party, or at a
dinner, or in familiar conversation, he
was the best of companions. Germany
has not produced another, unless it were
Goethe, so variedly entertaining; and
Goethe had no trace of one of Bismarcks
characteristics,  humor. He possessed
also tact and a sort of Homeric geniality
which, coupled with unbending tenacity,
fitted him to succeed as a diplomatist.
	In 1851 the King appointed him to
represent Prussia at the German Diet,
which sat at Frankfort. The outlook was
gloomy. Prussia had quelled the revo-
lution, but she had lost prestige. Unable
to break asunder the German Confeder-
ation or to dominate it, she had signed,
at Olmiitz, in the previous autumn, a
compact which acknowledged the supre-
macy of her old rival, Austria. While
the humiliation still rankled, Bismarck
entered upon his career. Hitherto not
unfriendly to Austria, because he had
looked upon her as the extinguisher of
the revolution, which he hated most of
all, he began, now that the danger was
over, to give a free rein to his jealousy</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00422" SEQ="0422" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="416">	416	Bismarek.
of his countrys hereditary competitor.
In the Diet, the Austrian representa-
tive presided, the rulings were always
in Austrias favor, the majority of the
smaller states allowed Austria to guide
them. Bismarck at once showed his col-
leagues that humility was not his r6le.
Finding that the Austrian president alone
smoked at the sittings, he took out his
own cigar and lighted it,  a trifle, but
significant. He resisted every encroach-
ment, and demanded the strictest obser-
vance of the letter of the law. Grad-
ually he extended Prussias influence
among the confederates. He unmasked
Austrias insincerity; he showed how
honestly Prussia walked in the path of
legality; until he slowly created the im-
pression that wickedness was to be ex-
pected from one, and virtue from the
other.
	During seven years Bismarck held
this outpost, winning no outward victo-
ry, but storing a vast amount of know-
ledge about all the states of the Con-
federation, their rulers and public men,
which was subsequently invaluable to
him. His dispatches to the Prussian Sec-
retary of State, his reports to the King,
form a body of diplomatic correspondence
unmatched in fullness, vigor, directness,
and insight. With him, there was no
ambiguity, no diplomatic circumlocu-
tion, no German proli~city. lie sketched
in indelible outlines the portraits, cor-
poral or mental, of his colleagues. He
criticised the policy of Prussia with a
brusqueness which must have startled his
superior. He reviewed at long~~r range
the political tendencies of Europe. Of-
ficially, he kept strictly within the limits
of his instructions; but his own person-
ality represented more than he could yet
officially declare,  Prussias ambition
to become the leader of Germany. In
all his dispatches, and in all places where
caution did not prescribe silence, he re-
iterated his Cato warning, Austria must
be ousted from Germany.
	Do not suppose, however, that Bis
mareks political greatness was then dis-
cerned. Probably, had you inquired of
Germans forty years ago, Who among
you is the coming statesman? not one
would have replied, Bismarck. At
the opera, we cannot mistake the hero,
because the moonlight obligingly follows
him over the stage; in real life, the
hero passes for the most part unrecog-
nized, until his appointed hour; but the
historians duty is to show how the he-
roic qualities were indubitably latent in
him long before the world perceived
them.
	In 1859 Bismarek was appointed am-
bassador at St. Petersburg, where he
stayed three years, when he was trans-
ferred to Paris. This completed his ap-
prenticeship, for in September, 1862, he
was recalled to Berlin to be minister-
president.
	His promotion had long been mooted.
Th~ new King William  a practical,
rigid monarch, with no Liberal visions,
no desire to please everybody  had
been for eighteen months in conflict with
his Parliament. He had determined to
reorganize the Prussian army; the Lib-
erals insisted that, as Parliament was
expected to vote appropriations, it should
know how they were spent. William at
last turned to Bismarck to help him sub-
jugate the unruly deputies, and Bis-
marck, with a true vassals loyalty, de-
clared his readiness to serve as lid to
the saucepan. Very soon the Liberals
began to compare him with Stafford, and
the King with Charles I., but neither of
them quailed. Death on the scaffold,
under certain circumstances, is as honor-
able, Bismarck said, as death on the
battlefield. I can imagine worse modes
of death than the axe. Hitherto he
had strenuously maintained the first ar-
ticle of his creed,  I believe in the
supremacy of Prussia; henceforth he
upheld with equal vigor the second, 
I believe in the autocracy of the King.
	The narrow Constitution limited the
Kings authority, making it coequal with</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00423" SEQ="0423" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="417">	B~smarck.	417
that of the Upper and Lower Chambers,
but Bismarck quickly taught the depu-
ties that he would not allow a sheet of
paper to intervene between the royal
will and its fulfillment. Year after year
the Lower House refused to vote the
army budget; year after year Bismarck
and his master pushed forward the mili-
tary organization, in spite of the depu-
ties. Noah was not more unmoved by
those who came and scoffed at his huge,
expensive, apparently useless ark than
were the Prussian minister and his King
by their critics, who did not see the pur-
pose of the ark the two were building.
Bismarck merely insisted that the army,
on which depended the integrity of the
nation, could not be subjected to the
caprice of parties; it was an institution
above parties, above politics, he said,
which the King alone must control.
	At the same time, the minister-presi-
dent actively pursued his other project,
 the expulsion of Austria from Ger-
many. When the King of Denmark
died, in December, 1863, the succession
to the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein
was disputed. Bismarck seized the oc-
casion for occupying the disputed terri-
tory, in partnership with Austria. Eng-
land protested, France muttered, but
neither cared to risk a war with the al-
lied robbers. When it came to dividing
the spoils, Bismarck, who had recently
gauged Austrias strength, struck for the
lions share. Austria resisted. Bismarck
then approved himself a master of diplo-
macy. Never was he more clever or
more unscrupulous, shifting from argu-
ment to argument, delaying the open
rupture till Prussia was quite ready,
feigning willingness to submit the dis-
pute to European arbitration while se-
cretly stipulating conditions which fore-
doomed arbitration to failure, and inva-
riably giving the impression that Austria
refused to be conciliated. As the jug-
gler lets you see the card he wishes you
to see, and no other, so Bismarck always
kept in full view, amid whatever shuf-

fling of the pack, the apparent legality
of Prussia. In the end he drove Aus-
tria to desperation.
	In June, 1866, war came, with fury.
One Prussian army crushed with a sin-
gle blow the German states which had
promised to support Austria; another
marched into Bohemia and, in seven
days, confronted the imperial forces at
Sadowa. There was fought a great bat-
tle, in which the Prussian crown prince
repeated the master stroke of Bl~cher at
Waterloo, and then Austria, hopelessly
beaten, sued for peace.
	Bismarck now showed himself astute
in victory. Having ousted Austria from
Germany, lie had no wish to wreak a
vengeance that she could not forgive.
Taking none of her provinces, he exacted
only a small indemnity. With the Ger-
man states he was equally discriminat-
ing: those which had been inveterately
hostile he annexed to Prussia; the- oth-
ers he let off with a fine. He set up
the North German Confederation, em-
bracing all the states north of the river
Main, in place of the old German Con-
federation; and thus Prussia, which had
now two thirds of the population of Ger-
many, was undisputed master. The four
South German states, Bavaria, WUrtem-
berg, Hesse, and Baden, signed a secret
treaty, by which they gave the Prussian
King the command of their troops in
case of war.
	Europe, which had witnessed with as-
tonishment these swift proceedings, un-
derstood now that a great reality had
arisen, and that Bismarck was its heart.
In France, surprise gave way to indigna-
tion. Were not the French the arbiters
of Europe? How had it happened that
their Emperor had permitted a first-rate
power to organize without their con-
sent? Napoleon III., who knew that
his sham empire could last only so long
as he furnished his restless subjects food
for their vanity, strove to convince them

a share of Rhineland to offset Prussia~ s
aggrandizement; Bismarck refused to
cede a single inch. Napoleon bullied;
Bismarek published the secret compact
with the South Germans. Napoleon
forthwith decided that it was not worth
while to go to war.
	We have all heard of the sportsman
who boasted of always catching big
strings of fish. But one day, after whip-.
ping every pool and getting never a
trout, he was fain, on his way home, to
stop at the market and buy him a salt
herring for supper. Not otherwise did
Napoleon, who had been very forward
in announcing that he would take land
wherever he chose, now stoop to offer to
buy enough to appease his greedy coun-
trymen. He would pay ninety million
francs for Luxemburg, and the King of
Holland, to whom it belonged, was will.
ing to sell at that price; but Bismarck
would consent only to withdraw the Prus-
sian garrison from the grand duchy,
after destroying the fortifications, and
to its conversion into a neutral state.
That was the sum of the satisfaction
Napoleon and his presumptuous French-
men got from their first encounter. A
few years before, Napoleon, who had
had frequent interviews with Bismarck,
and aiked his joviality, set him down as
a not serious man; whence we infer
that the Emperor was a dull reader of
character.
	Although, by this arrangement, the
Luxemburg affair blew over, neither
France ~nor Prussia believed that their
quarrel was settled. Deep in the heart
of each, instinct whispered that a life-
and-death struggle was inevitable. Bis-
marck, amid vast labor on the internal
organization of the kingdom, held Prus-
sia ready for war. He would not be the
aggressor, but he would decline no chal-
lenge.
	In July~ 1870, France threw down
the glove. When the Spaniards elected
Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern to their
vacant throne, France demanded that
King William should compel Leopold to
resign. William replied that, as he had
not influenced his kinsmans acceptance,
he should not interfere. The prince,
who was not a Prussian, withdrew of
his own accord. But the French Secre-
tary of State, the Due de Gramont, had
blustered too loudly to let the matter
end without achieving his purpose of
humbling the Prussian King. He there-
fore telegraphed Benedetti, the French
ambassador, to force King William to
promise that at no future time should
Leopold be a candidate for the Spanish
crown. Benedetti delivered his message
to William in the public garden at Ems;
and William, naturally refusing to bind
himself, announced that further negoti-
ations on the subject would be referred
to the foreign minister.
	The following morning Bismarek pub-
lished a dispatch containing a brief re-
port of the interview; adding, however,
that the King declined to receive the
French ambassador again, and had him
told by the adjutant in attendance that
his Majesty had nothing further to com-
municate to the ambassador. This de-
ceitful addition produced exactly the ef-
fect which Bismarek intended: every
German, whether Prussian or not, was
incensed to learn that the representative
German King had been hectored by the
French emissary, and every Frenchman
was enraged that the Prussian King had
insulted the envoy of the grand na-
tion. Bismarck, who had feared that
another favorable moment for war was
passing, now exulted, and Moltke, who
had for years been carrying the future
campaign in his head, and whose face
grew sombre when peace seemed proba-
ble, now smiled a grim, contented smile.
In Paris, the ministers, the deputies, the
newspapers, and the populace clamored
for war. Apparently, Napoleon alone
felt a slight hesitation; but he could
hesitate no longer when the popular de-
mand became overwhelming. On July
19 France made a formal declaration</PB>

of war, and the Parisians laid bets that
their victorious troops would celebrate
the Fete Napoh~on  August 15 in
Berlin. Had not their war minister, Le-
bceuf, assured them that everything was
ready, down to the last hutton on the
last gaiter of the last soldier?
	We cannot describe here the terrible
campaign which followed. In numbers,
in equipment, in discipline, in general-
ship, in everything but bravery, the
French were quickly outmatched. When
Napoleon groped madly for some friend-
ly hand to stay his fall, he found that
Bismarck had cut off succor from him.
The South Germans, whom the French
had hoped to win over, fought loyally
under the command of Prussia; Aus-
tria, who might have been persuaded to
strike back at her late conqueror, dared
not move for fear of Russia, whose
friendship Bismarck had secured; and
Italy, instead of aiding France, lost no
time in completing her own unification
by entering Rome.when the French gar-
rison was withdrawn. Forsaken and
outwitted, the French Empire sank with-
out even an expiring flash of that tinsel
glory which had so long bedizened its
corruption. And when the French peo-
ple, lashed to desperation, continued the
war which the empire had brought upon
them, they but suffered a long agony of
losses before accepting the inevitable de-
feat. They paid the penalty of their
former arrogance in every coin known
to the vanquished,  in military ruin, in
an enormous indemnity, in the occupa-
tion of their land by the victorious Prus-
sians, and in the cession of two rich
provinces. Nor was that enough: they
had to submit to a humiliation which, to
the imagination at least, seems the worst
of all,  the proclamation of the Prus-
sian King William as German Emperor
in their palace at Versailles, the shrine
of French pomp, where two centuries
before Louis XIV. had embodied the
ambition, the glory, and the pride of
France. The German cannon bombard-
419
ing beleaguered Paris paused, while the
sovereigns of the German states hailed
William as their Emperor.
	This consummation of German un.ity
was the logical outcome of an interna-
tional war, in which all the Germans had
been impelled, by mutual interests quite
as much as by kinship, to join forces
against an alien foe. Twenty years be-
fore, Bismarck had opposed German
unity, because it would then have made
Prussia the plaything of her confeder-
ates; in this later scheme he was the
chief agent, if not the originator, for he
knew that the primacy of Prussia ran no
more risk.
	Let us pause a moment and look ba~k.
Only a decade earlier, in 1861, when
Bismarck became minister, Prussia was
but a second-rate power, Germany was a
medley of miscellaneous states, Austria
still held her traditional supremacy, the
French Emperor seemed firmly estab-
lished. Now, in 1871, Austria has been
humbled, France crushed, Napoleon
whiffed off into outer darkness, and
Prussia stands unchallenged at the head
of United Germany. Many men 
the narrow, patient King, the taciturn
Moltke, the energetic von Roon  have
contributed to this result; but to Bis-
marck rightly belongs the highest credit.
Slow to prepare and swift to strike, he
it was who measured the full capacity
of that great machine, the Prussian
army, and let it do its work the moment
Fortune signaled; he it was who knew
that needle guns and discipline would
overcome in the end the long prestige of
Austria and the wordy insolence of
France. Looking back, we are amazed
at his achievements,  many a step
seems audacious; but if we investigate,
we find that Bismarck had never threat-
ened, never dared, more than his strength
at the time warranted. The gods love
men of the positive degree, and reward
them by converting their words into
facts.
	Of the German Empire thus formed</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00426" SEQ="0426" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="420">	420	Bismarek.

Bismarek was Chancellor for twenty
years. His foreign policy hinged on
one necessity,  the isolation of France.
To that end he made a Triple Alliance,
in which Russia and Austria were his
partners first, and afterward Italy took
Russias place. He prevented the Fran-
co-Russian coalition, which would place
Germany between the hammer and the
anvil. From 1871 to 1890 he was not
less the arbiter of Europe than the auto-
crat of Germany.
	Nevertheless, although in the manage-
ment of home affairs Bismarck usually
prevailed, he prevailed to the detriment
of Germanys progress in self-govern-
ment. The Empire, like Prussia her-
self, is based on constitutionalism: what
hope is there for constitutionalism, when
at any moment the vote of a majority
of the peoples representatives can be
nullified by an arbitrary prime minister?
Bismarck carried his measures in one of
two ways: he either formed a temporary
combination with mutually discordant
parliamentary groups, and thereby se-
cured a majority vote, or, when unable
to do this, by threatening to resign he
gave the Emperor an excuse for vetoing
an objectionable bill. Despising repre-
sentative government, with its intermi-
nable chatter, its red tape, its indiscreet
meddling, and its whimsical revulsions,
Bismarck never concealed his scorn. If
he believed a measure to be needed, he
went down into the parliamentary mar-
ket-place, and by inducements, not of
money, but of concessions, he won over
votes. At one time or another, every
group has voted against him and every
group has voted for him. When he was
fighting the Vatican, for instance, he
conciliated the Jews; when Jew-baiting
was his purpose, he promised the Cath-
olics favor in return for their support.
Being amenable to the Emperor alone,
and not, like the British Premier, the
head of a party, he dwelt above the ca-
price of parties. Men thought, at first,
to stagger him by charges of inconsist
ency, and quoted his past utterances
against his present policy. He laughed
at them. Consistency, he held, is the
clog of men who do not advance; for
himself, he had no hesitation in altering
his policy as fast as circumstances re-
quired. With characteristic bluntness,
he did not disguise his intentions. I
need your support, he would say to a
hostile group, and I will stand by your
bill if you will vote for mine. DQ
ut des was his motto; an honest
broker his self-given nickname.
	Such a government cannot properly
be called representative; it dangles be-
tween the two incompatibles, constita-
tionalism and autocracy. Doubtless Bis-
marck knew better than the herd of
deputies what would best serve at a
given moment the interests of Germany;
but his methods were demoralizing, and
so personal that they made no provision
for the future. His system could not be
permanent unless in every generation an
autocrat as powerful and disinterested
as himself should arise to wield it; but
nature does not repeat her Bismareks
and her Cromwells. At the end of his
career, Germany has still to undergo her
apprenticeship in self-government.
	Two important struggles, in which he
engaged with all his might, call for es-
pecial mention.
	The first is the Culturkampf, or con-
test with the Pope over the appointment
of Catholic bishops and clergy in Prus-
sia. Bismarck insisted that the Pope
should submit his nominations to the
approval of the King; Pius IX. main-
tained that in spiritual matters he could
be bound by no temporal lord. Bismarck
passed stern laws; he withheld the sti-
pend paid to the Catholic clergy; he
imprisoned some of them; he broke up
the parishes of others. It was the me-
diawal war of investitures over again,
and again the Pope won. Bismarck
discovered that against the intangible
resistance of Rome his Krupp guns were
powerless. After fifteen years of inef</PB>

fectual battling, the Chancellor surren-
dered.
	Similar discomfiture came to him from
the Socialists. When he entered upon
his ministerial career, they were but a
gang of noisy fanatics; when he quitted
it, they were a great political party,
holding the balance of power in the
Reicbstag, and infecting Germany with
their doctrines. At first he thought to
extirpate them by violence, but they
throve under persecution; then he pro-
pitiated them, and even strove to fore-
stall them by adopting Socialistic mea-
sures in advance of their demands. If
the next epoch is to witness the triumph
of Socialism, as some predict, then Bis-
marck will surely merit a place in the
Socialists Saints Calendar; but if, as
some of us hope, society revolts from
Socialism before experience teaches how
much insanity underlies this seductive
theory, then Bismarck will scarcely be
praised for coquetting with it. For So-
cialism is but despotism turned upside
down; it would substitute the tyranny
of an abstraction  the state  for the
tyranny of a personal autocrat. It rests
on the fallacy that though in every in-
dividual citizen there is more or less im-
perfection,  one dishonest, another un-
truthful, another unjust, another greedy,
another licentious, another willing to
grasp money or power at the expense of
his neighbor,  yet by adding up all
these units, so imperfect, so selfish, and
calling the sum the state, you get a
perfect and unselfish organism, which
will manage without flaw or favor the
whole business, public, private, and
mixed, of mankind. By what miracle
a coil of links, separately weak, can be
converted into an unbreakable chain is
a secret which the prophets of this Uto-
pia have never condescended to reveal.
Not more state interference, but less, is
the warning of history.
	The fact which is significant for us
here is that Socialism has best thriven
in Germany, where, through the innate
tendency of the Germans to a rigid sys-
tem, the machinery of despotism has been
most carefully elaborated, and where the
interference of the state in the most triv-
ial affairs of life has bred in the masses
the notion that the state can do every-
thing,  even make the poor rich, if they
can only control the lever of the huge
machine.
	Nevertheless, though ~3ismarck has
been worsted in his contest with reli-
gious and social ideas, his great achieve-
ment remains. He has placed Germany
at the head of Europe, and Prussia at
the head of Germany. Will the Ger-
man Empire created by him last? Who
can say? The historian has no business
with prophecy, but he may point out the
existence in the German Empire to-day
of conditions that have hitherto menaced
the safety of nations. The common
danger seems the strongest bond of
union among the German states. De-
feat by Russia on the east or by France
on the west would mean disaster for
the South Germans not less than for the
Prussians; and this peril is formidable
ervough to cause the Bavarians, for in-
stance, to fight side by side with the
Prussians. But there can be no homo-
geneous internal government, no com-
pact nation, so long as twenty or more
dynasties, coequal in dignity though not
in power, flourish simultaneously. His-
torically speaking, Germany has never
passed through that stage of develop-
ment in which one dynasty swallows up
its rivals,  the experience of England,
France, and Spain, and even of polyglot
Austria.
	Again, Germany embraces three un-
willing members,  Alsace - Lorraine,
Schleswig, and Prussian Poland,  any
of which may serve as a provocation
for war, and must remain a constant
source of racial antipathy. How griev-
ous such political thorns may be, though
small in bulk compared to the body they
worry, England has learned from Ire-
land.</PB>

	Finally, if popular government the
ideal of our century  is to prevail in
Germany, the despotism extended and
solidified by Bismarck will be swept
away. Possibly, Germany could not
have been united, could not have hum-
bled Austria and crushed France, under
a Liberal system; but will the Germans
forever submit to the direction of an
iron Chancellor, or glow with exultation
at the truculence of a strutting autocrat
who flourishes his sword and proclaims,
My will is law ? No other modern
despotism has been so patriotic, honest,
and successful as that of Bismarck; but
will the Gernians never awake to the
truth that even the best despotism con-
victs those who bow to it of a certain
ignoble servility? Or will they, as we
have suggested, transform the tyranny
of an autocrat into the tyranny of Social-
ism? We will not predict, but we can
plainly see that Germany, whether in her
national or in her constitutional condi-
tion, has reached no stable plane of de-
velopment.
	And now what shall we conclude as to
Bismarck himself? The magnitude of
his work no man can dispute. For cen-
turies Europe awaited the unification of
Germany, as a necessary step in the or-
ganic growth of both. Feudalism was
the principle which bound Christendom
together during the Middle Age; after-
ward, the dynastic principle operated to
blend peoples into nations; finally, in
our time, the principle of nationality has
accomplished what neither feudalism nor
dynasties could accomplish, the attain-
ment of German unity. In type, Bis-
marek belongs with the Charlemagnes,
the Cromwells, the Napoleons; but, un-
like them, he wrought to found no king-
doin f~or himself; from first to last he
was content to be the servant of the
monarch whom he ruled. As a states-
man, he possessed in equal mixture the
qualities of lion and of fox, which Ma-
chiavelli long ago declared indispensa-
ble to a prince. He had no scruples.
What benefited Prussia and his King
was to him moral, lawful, desirable; to
them he was inflexibly loyal; for them
he would suffer popular odium or incur
personal danger. But whoever opposed
them was to him an enemy, to be over-
come by persuasion, craft, or force. We
discern in his conduct toward enemies
no more regard for morality than in that
of a Mohawk sachem toward his Huron
foe. He might spare them, but from
motives of policy; he might persecute
them, not to gratify a thirst for cruelty,
but because he deemed persecution the
proper instrument in that case. ~iis jus-
tification would be that it was right that
Prussia and Germany should hold the
first rank in Europe. The world, as he
saw it, was a field in which nations main-
tained a pitiless struggle for existence,
and the strongest survived; to make his
nation the strongest was, he conceived,
his highest duty. An army of puny-
bodied saints might be beautiful to a
pious imagination, but they would fare
ill in an actual conflict with Pomeranian
grenadiers.
	Dynamic, therefore, and not moral,
were Bismarcks ideals and methods.
To make every citizen a soldier, and to
make every soldier a most effective
fighting machine by the scientific ap-
plication of diet, drill, discipline, and
leadership, was Prussias achievement,
whereby she prepared for Bismarck an
irresistible weapon. In this application
of science to control with greater ex-
actness than ever before the movements
of large masses of men in war, and to
regulate their actions in peace, consists
Prussias contribution to government;
in knowing how to use the engine thus
constructed lies Bismareks fame. When
Germans were building air-castles, and,
conscious of their irresolution, were ask-
ing themselves, Is Germany Hamlet?
Bismarek saw both a definite goal and
the road that led to it. The sentimen-
talism which has characterized so much
of the action of our time never diluted</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00429" SEQ="0429" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="423">	Bismarcic.	423
his tremendous will. He held that by
blood and iron empires are welded, and
that this stern means causes in the end
less suffering than the indecisive com-
promises of the sentimentalists. Better,
he would say, for ninety-nine men to be
directed by the hundredth man who
knows than for them to be left a prey
to their own chaotic, ignorant, and inter-
necine passions. Thus he is the latest
representative of a type which flourished
in the age when the modern ideal of
popular government had not yet risen.
How much of his power was due to his
unerring perception of the defects in
popular government as it has thus far
been exploited, we have already re-
marked.
	The Germans have not yet perceived
that one, perhaps the chief source of his
success was his un-German characteris-
tics. Hewould have all Germany bound
by rigid laws, but he would not be bound
by them himself. He encouraged his
countrymens passion for conventionali-
ty and tradition, but remained the most
unconventional of men. Whatever might
complete the conversion of Germany
into a vast machine he fostered by every
art; but he, the engineer who held the
throttle, was no machine. In a land
where everything was done by prescrip-
tion, the spectacle of one man doing
whatever his will prompted produced
an effect not easily computed. Such
characteristics are un - German, we re-
peat, and Bismarck displayed them at
all times and in all places. His smoking
a cigar in the Frankfort Diet; his op-
position to democracy, when democracy
was the fashion; his resistance to the
Prussian Landtag; his arbitrary meth-
ods in the German Parliament,  these
are but instances, great or small, of his
un-German nature. And his relations
for thirty years with the King and Em-
peror whom he seemed to serve show a
similar masterfulness. A single anec-
dote, told by himself, gives the key to
that service.
	At the battle of Sadowa King William
persisted in exposing himself at short
range to the enemys fire. Bismarck
urged him back, but William was ob-
stinate. If not for yourself, at least
for the sake of your minister, whom
the nation will hold responsible, retire,
pleaded Bismarck. Well, then, Bis-
marck, let us ride on a little, the King
at last replied. But he rode very slowly.
Edging his horse alongside of the Kings
mare, Bismarck gave her a stout kick in
the haunch. She bounded forward, and
the King looked round in astonishment.
I think he saw what I had done, Bis-
inarck added, in telling the story, but
he said nothing.
	On Bismarcks private character I
find no imputed stain. He did not en-
rich himself by his office, that hideous
vice of our time. He did not, like both
Napoleons, convert his palace into a
harem; neither did he tolerate nepo-
tism, nor the putting of incompetent
parasites into responsible positions as a
reward for party service. That he re-
morselessly crushed his rivals let his
obliteration of Count von Arnim wit-
ness. That he subsidized a reptile
press, or employed spies, or hounded
his assailants, came from his belief that
a statesman too squeamish to fight fire
with fire would deserve to be burnt.
Many orators have excelled him in
grace, few in effectiveness. Regarding
public speaking as one of the chief perils
of the modern state, because it enables
demagogues to dupe the easily swayed
masses, he despised rhetorical artifice.
His own speech was un-German in its
directness, un-German in its humor, and
it clove to the heart of a question with
the might of a battle-axe,  as, indeed,
he would have used a battle-axe itself
to persuade his opponents, five hundred
years ago. Since Napoleon, no other
European statesman has coined so many
political proverbs and apt phrases. His
letters to his family are delightfully natu-
ral, and reveal a man of keen observa</PB>

pleasures of life, and brimful of com-
mon sense, which a rich gift of humor
keeps from the dullness of Philistines
and the pedantry of doctrinaires. His
intercourse with friends seems to have
been in a high degree jovial.
	A great man we may surely pro-
nounce him, long to be the wonder of a
world in which greatness of any kind is
rare. If you ask, How does he stand
beside Washington and Lincoln? it
must be admitted that his methods would
have made them blush, but that his pa-
triotism was not less enduring than theirs.
With the materials at hand he fash-
ioned an empire; it is futile to speculate
whether another, by using different tools,
could have achieved the same result.
Bismarck knew that though his country-
men might talk eloquently about liberty,
they loved to be governed; he knew
that their genius was mechanical; and
he triumphed by directing them along
the line of their genius. He would have
failed had he appealed to the love of
liberty, by appealing to which Cavour
freed Italy; or to the love of glory, by
appealing to which Napoleon was able
to convert half of Europe into a French
province. Bismarck knew that his Prus-
sians must be roused in a different way.
	It may be that the empire he created
will not last; it is certain that it can-
not escape modifications which will
change the aspect he stamped upon it;
but we may be sure that, whatever hap-
pens, the recollection of his Titanic per-
sonality will remain. He belongs among
the giants, among the few in whom has
been stored for a lifetime a stupendous
energy,  kinsmen of the whirlwind and
the volcano,  whose purpose seems to
be to amaze us that the limits of the
human include such as they. At the
thought of him, there rises the vision of

Odin with his spear; the legend of Zeus,

MR. RILEYS POETRY.

	Ev1~N if Mr. Rileys poetry which,
along with his prose, now has the distinc-
tion of abeautiful uniform edition (Scrib-
ners)  had no claim to distinction in
itself, the fact of its unrivaled popular-
ity would challenge consideration. But,
fortunately, his work does not depend
on so frail a tenure of fame as the vogue
of a season or the life of a fad. The
qualities which secure for it a wider
reading and a heartier appreciation than
are accorded to any other living Ameri-
can poet are rooted deep in human na-
ture; they are pret~minently qualities of
wholesomeness and common sense, those
qualities of steady and conservative
cheerfulness which ennoble the average
man, and in which the man of excep
tional culture is too often lacking. Its
lovers are the ingenuous home-keeping
hearts, on whose sobriety and humor the
national character is based. And yet,
one has not said enough when one says
it is poetry of the domestic affections,
poetry of sentiment; for it is much more
than that.
	Poetry which is free from the un-
happy spirit of the age, free from de-
jection, from doubt, from material cyni-
cism, neither tainted by the mould of
sensuality nor wasted by the maggot of
reform, is no common product, in these
days. So much of our art and literature
is ruined by self-consciousness, running
to the artificial and the tawdry. It is

along with his prose, now has the distinc-
tion of abeautiful uniform edition (Scrib-
ners)  had no claim to distinction in
itself, the fact of its unrivaled popular-
ity would challenge consideration. But,
fortunately, his work does not depend
on so frail a tenure of fame as the vogue
of a season or the life of a fad. The
qualities which secure for it a wider
reading and a heartier appreciation than
are accorded to any other living Ameri-
can poet are rooted deep in human na-
ture; they are pret~minently qualities of
wholesomeness and common sense, those
qualities of steady and conservative
cheerfulness which ennoble the average
man, and in which the man of excep
tional culture is too often lacking. Its
lovers are the ingenuous home-keeping
hearts, on whose sobriety and humor the
national character is based. And yet,
one has not said enough when one says
it is poetry of the domestic affections,
poetry of sentiment; for it is much more
than that.
	Poetry which is free from the un-
happy spirit of the age, free from de-
jection, from doubt, from material cyni-
cism, neither tainted by the mould of
sensuality nor wasted by the maggot of
reform, is no common product, in these
days. So much of our art and literature
is ruined by self-consciousness, running
to the artificial and the tawdry. It is
the slave either of commercialism, imita</PB>

tive, ornate, and insufferably tiresome,
or of didacticism, irresponsible and dull.
But Mr. Riley at his best is both original
and sane. He seems to have accoin-
plished that most difficult feat, the devo-
tion of ones self to an art without any
deterioration of health. He is full of
the sweetest vitality, the soundest mer-
riment. His verse is not strained with
an overburden of philosophy, on the one
hand, nor debauched with maudlin senti-
mentalism, on the other. Its robust gay-
ety has all the fascination of artlessness
and youth. It neither argues, nor stimu-
lates, nor denounces, nor exhorts; it only
touches and entertains us. And after
all, few things are more humanizing than
innocent amusement.
	It is because of this quality of abun-
dant good nature, familiar, serene, home-
ly, that it seems to me no exaggeration
to call Mr. Riley the typical American
poet of the day. True, he does not
represent the cultivated and academic
classes; he reflects nothing of modern
thought; but in his unruffled temper and
dry humor, occasionally flippant on the
surface, but never facetious at heart, he
might stand very well for the normal
American character in his view of life
and his palpable enjoyment of it. Most
foreign critics are on the lookout for the
appearance of something novel and un-
conventional from America, forgetting
that the laws of art do not change with
longitude. They seize now on this writer,
now on that, as the eminent product of
democracy. But there is nothing uncon-
ventional about Mr. Riley. He is like
folks, as an old New England farmer
said of Whittier. And if the typical
poet of democracy in America is to be
the man who most nearly represents aver-
age humanity throughout the length and
breadth of this country, who most com-
pletely expresses its humor, its sympa-
thy, its intelligence, its culture, and its
common sense, and yet is not without
a touch of original genius sufficient to
stamp his utterances, then Mr. James
Whitcomb Riley has a just claim to that
title.
	He is unique among American men of
letters (or poets, one might better say;
for strictly speaking he is not a man of
letters at all) in that he has originality of
style, and yet is entirelynative and home
ly.	Whitman was original, but he was
entirely prophetic and remote, appealing
only to the few; Longfellow had style,
but his was the voice of our collegiate and
cultivated classes. It is not a question
of rank or comparison; it is merely a
matter of definitions. It is the position
rather than the magnitude of any partic-
ular and contemporary star that one is
interested in fixing. To determine its
magnitude, a certain quality of endur-
ance must be taken into account; and to
observe this quality often requires con-
siderable time. Quite apart, then, from
Mr. Rileys relative merit in the great
anthology of English poetry, he has a
very definite and positive place in the
history of American letters as the first
widely representative poet of the Amer-
ican people.
He is professedly a home - keeping,
home-loving poet, with the purpose of
the imaginative realist, depending upon
common sights and sounds for his in-
spirations, and engrossed with the sig-
nificance of facts. Like Mr. Kipling,
whose idea of perpetual bliss is a heaven
where every artist shall draw the thing
as he sees it, for the God of things as
they are, Mr. Riley exclaims: 
Tell of the things jest like they wuz 
They dont need no excuse!
Dont tetch em up as the poets does,
Till they re all too fine fer use!

And again, in his lines on A Southern
Singer: 
Sing us back home, from there to here:
Grant your high grace and wit, but we
Most honor your simplicity.

In the proem to the volume Poems here
at Home there occurs a similar invoca-
tion, and a test of excellence is proposed</PB>

which may well be taken as the gist of
his own artistic purpose:
The	Poems here at Home! Who 11 write
em down,
Jes as they air  in Country and in Town ? 
Sowed thick as clods is crost the fields and
lanes,
Er these ere little hop-toads when it rains!
Who 11 voiceem? as I heerd a feller say
At speechified on Freedom, tother day,
And soared the Eagle tel, it peared to me,
She was nt bigger n a bumble-bee!

What We want, as I sense it, in the line
0 poetry is somepin Yours and Mine 
Somepin with live-stock in it, and out-doors,
And old crick-bottoms, snags, and sycamores!
Putt weeds in  pizenvines, and underbresh,
As well as johnny-jump-ups, all so fresh
And	sassy-like  and groun-sqnirls,  yes,
and We,
As sayin is,  We, Us and Company.

	In the lines Right here at Home the
same strain recurs, like the very burden
of the poets life-song: 
Right here at home, boys, is the place, I
guess,
Fer me and you and plain old happiness:
We hear the World s lots grander  likely
so, 
We 11 take the Worlds word for it and not
go.
We	know its ways aint our ways, so we 11
stay
Right here at home, boys, where we know
the way.

Right bere at home, boys, where a well-to-do
Man s plenty rich enough  and knows it,
too,
And s got a extry dollar, any time,
To boost a feller up at wants to climb,
Ands got the git-up in him to go in
And git there, like he purt nigh allus kin!

	It is in this spirit that by far the
greater part of his work, the telling and
significant part of it, is conceived. The
whole tatterdemalion company of his
Tugg Martins, Jap Millers, Armazindys,
Bee Fesslers, and their comrades, as
rollicking and magnetic as Shakespeares
own wonderful populace, he finds right
here at home; nothing human is alien
to him; indeed, there is something truly
Elizabethan, something spacious and ro
bust, in his humanity, quite exceptional
to our fashion-plate standards. In the
same wholesome, glad frame of mind,
too, he deals with nature,  mingling
the keenest, most loving observation with
the most familiar modes of speech. An
artist in his ever sensitive appreciation
and impressionability, never missing a
phase or mood of natural beauty, he has
the added ability so necessary to the
final touch of illusion,  the power of
ease, the power of making his most cas-
ual word seem inevitable, and his most
inevitable word seem casual. It is in
this, I think, that he differs from all his
rivals in the field of familiar and dialect
poetry. Other writers are as familiar
as he, and many as truly inspired; but
none combines to such a degree the
homespun phrase with the lyric feeling.
His only compeer in this regard is Low-
ell, in the brilliant Biglow Papers and
several other less known but not less
admirable Chaucerian sketches of New
England country life. Indeed, in hu-
mor, in native eloquence, in vivacity,
Mr. Riley closely resembles Lowell,
though differing from that bookman in
his training and inclination, and natu-
rally, as a consequence, in his range and
treatment of subjects. But the tide of
humanity, so strong in Lowell, is at
flood, too, in the Hoosier poet. It is this
humane character, preserving all the
rugged sweetness in the elemental type
of man, which can save us at last as a
people from the ravaging taint of char-
latanism, frivolity, and greed.
	But we must not leave our subject
without discriminating more closely be-
tween several sorts of Mr. Rileys poet-
ry; for there is as much difference be-
tween his dialect and his classic English
(in point of poetic excellence, I mean)
as there is between the Scotch and the
English of Burns. Like Burns, he is a
lover of the human and the simple, a
lover of green fields and blowing flow-
ers; and like Burns, he is far more at
home, far more easy and felicitous, in

his native Doric than in the colder Attic
speech of Milton and Keats.
	This is so, it seems to me, for two
reasons. In the first place, the poet is
dealing with the subject matter he knows
best; and in the second place, he is using
the medium of expression in which he
has a lifelong facility. The art of po-
etry is far too delicate and too difficult
to be practiced successfully without the
most consummate and almost uncon-
scious mastery of the language em-
ployed; so that a poet will hardly ever
write with anything like distinction or
convincing force in any but his mother
tongue. An artists command of his me-
dium must be so intimate and exquisite
that his thought can find adequate expres-
sion in it as easily as in the lifting of a
finger or the moving of an eyelid. Other-
wise he is self-conscious, unnatural, false;
and, hide it as he may, we feel the awk-
wardness and indecision in his work.
He who treats of subjects which he
knows only imperfectly cannot be true
to nature; while he who employs some
means of expression which he only im-
perfectly controls cannot be true to him-
self. The best art requires the fulfill-
ment of both these severe demands; they
are the cardinal virti~es of art. Disre-
gard of the first produces the dilettante;
disregard of the second produces the
charlatan. That either of these epithets
would seem entirely incongruous, if am
plied to Mr. Riley, is a tribute to his
thorough worth as a writer.
	His verse, then, divides itself sharply
into two kinds, the dialect and the con-
ventional. But we have so completely
identified him with the former manner
that it is hard to estimate his work in
the latter. It may be doubted, however,
whether he would have reached his pre-
sent eminence, had he confined his ef-
forts to the strictly regulated forms of
standard English. In poems like A Life
Term and One Afternoon, for instance,
there is smoothness, even grace of move-
ment, but hardly that distinction which
we call style, and little of the lyric plan-
gency the author commands at his best;
while very often in his use of authorized
English there is a strangely marked re-
miniscence of older poets, as of Keats in
A Water Color (not to speak of A Ditty
of No Tone, written as a frankly imita-
tive tribute of admiration for the author
of the Ode to a Grecian Urn), or of Em-
erson in The All-Kind Mother. In only
one of the dialect poems, on the other
hand, so far as I recall them, is there
any imitative note. His Nothin to Say
has macli of the atmosphere and feeling
as well as the movement of Tennysons
Northern Farmer. But for the most
part, when Mr. Riley uses his own dia-
lect, he is thoroughly original as well as
effective. He has not only the lyrical
impetus so needful to good poetry; lie
has also the story - tellers gift. And
when we add to these two qualities an
abundant share of whimsical humor, we
have the equipment which has so justly
given him wide repute.
All of these characteristics are brought
into play in such poems as Fesslers
Bees, one of the fairest examples of Mr.
Rileys balladry at its best: 
Might call him a bee-expert,
When it come to handlin bees, 
Roll the sleeves up of his shirt
And wade in amongst the trees
Where a swarm nd settle, and 
Blamedest man on top of dirt! 
Rake em with his naked hand
Right back in the hive agin,
Jes as easy as you p]ea.se!

For Mr. Riley is a true balladist. He
is really doing for the modern popular
taste, here and now, what the old ballad-
ists did in their time. He is an enter-
tainer. He has the ear of his audience.
He knows their likes and dislikes, and hu-
mors them. His very considerable and
very successful experience as a public
reader of his own work has reinforced
(one may guess) his natural modesty and
love of people, and made him constantly
regardful of their pleasure. So that we
must look upon his verses as a most gen</PB>

uine and spontaneous expression of aver-
age poetic feeling as well as personal po-
etic inspiration.
	Every artists work must be, necessa-
rily, a more or less successful compromise
between these two opposing and difficult
conditions of achievement. The great
artists are they who succeed at last in im-
posing upon others their own peculiar and
novel conceptions of beauty. But these
are only the few whom the gods favor
beyond their fellows; while for the rank
and file of those who deal in the perish-
able wares of art a less ambitious stan-
dard may well be allowed. We must
have our balladists as well as our bards,
it seems; and very fortunate is the day
when we can have one with so much real
spirit and humanity about him as Mr.
Riley.
	At times the pathos of the theme quite
outweighs its homeliness, and lifts the
author above the region of self-conscious
art; the use of dialect drops away, and
a creation of pure poetry comes to light,
as in that irresistible elegy Little Haly,
for example 
Little Haly, little Haly, cheeps the robin
in the tree;
Little Haly, sighs the clover; Little
Haly, moans the bee;
Little Haly, little Haly, calls the km-dee
at twilight;
And the katydids and crickets hollers
Haly all the night.

In this powerful lyric there is a simple
directness approaching the feeling of
Greek poetry, and one cannot help re-
gretting the few intrusions of bad gram-
mar and distorted spelling. They are
not necessary. The poem is so universal
in its human appeal, it seems a pity to
limit the range of its appreciation by
hampering it with local peculiarities of
speech.
	At times, too, in his interpretations of
nature, Mr. Riley lays aside his drollery
and his drawling accent in exchange for
an incisive power of phrase.
	The wild goose trails his harrow
is an example of the keenness of fancy
I refer to. Another is found in the clos-
ing phrase of one of the stanzas in A
Country Pathway 
A puritanic quiet here reviles
The almost whispered warble from the
hedge,
And takes a locusts rasping voice and ifies
The silence to an edge.

	In The Flying Islands of the Night
Mr. Riley has made his widest departure
into the reign of whimsical imagination.
Here he has retained that liberty of un-
shackled speech, that freedom and ease
of diction, which mark his more familiar
themes, and at the same time has en-
tered an entirely fresh field for him, a
sort of grown-up fairyland. There are
many strains of fine poetry in this min-
iature play, which show Mr. Rileys
lyrical faculty at its best. In one in-
stance there is a peculiar treatment of
the octosyllabic quatrain, where he has
chosen (one cannot guess why) to print
it in the guise of blank verse. It is im-
possible, however, to conceal the true
swing of the lines.
I loved her. Why? I never knew. Perhaps
Because her face was fair. Perhaps because
Her eyes were blue and wore a weary air.
Perhaps! Perhaps because her limpid face
Was eddied with a restless tide, wherein
The dimples found no place to anchor and
Abide. Perhaps because her tresses beat
A froth of gold about her throat, and poured
In splendor to the feet that ever seemed
Afloat. Perhaps because of that wild way
Her sudden laughter overleapt propriety;
Or  who will say ?  perhaps the way she
wept.

	It almost seems as if Mr. Riley, with
his bent for jesting and his habit of wear-
ing the cap and bells, did not dare be as
poetical as he could; and when a serious
lyric oame to him, he must hide it under
the least lyrical appearance, as he has
done here. But that, surely, if it be so,
is a great injustice to himself. He might
well attempt the serious as well as the
comic side of poetry, remembering that
when the half-gods go, the gods arrive.

		THE END OF THE WAR, AND AFTER.

	IT is reason for universal congratula-
tion that the war is ended (for it seems
safe to assume that it is ended) so early
and so happily,  for us, for the Span-
ish colonies, and, in spite of her present
humiliation, for Spain herself; for the
result makes for eivilization. There was
never a doubt that it would end with
an American victory; but that the vic-
tory would be so easily and so cheaply
won was not foreseen. Nor were the in-
cidental benefits foreseen; for there are
incidental benefits as great as the main
result itself. Unforeseen, also, were the
new obligations that have been imposed
on us.
The problem of governing countries not
only separated from the United States,
but populated by different races and ac-
customed to different institutions from
ours, is a new problem; but it is a pro-
blem that our English kinsmen have so
successfully solved that we shall be dull
indeed if we do not succeed, with their
experience to instruct us. The present
popular mood regarding this new task,
as regarding most other large undertak-
ings in which a national spirit must play
an important part, seems to be a deep-
seated and safe mood. The people, there
can hardly be doubt, prefer to retain the
territory that has fallen to them by the
fortune of war, and they do not share the
foreboding of the intelligent minority,
whose individualism estranges them from
the national feeling, and who see grave
danger to our institutions in such addi-
tions to our political tasks. National
feeling is a safer guide to national devel-
opment than the mere reasoning process
of critical minds. At any rate, it at
last becomes the only guide.
	The danger to our successful manage-
ment of Cuba and Porto Rico, or even of
the Philippine Islands, consists, not in
their distance from our shores, but in their
difference of population and institutions
from ours. They cannot be converted into
American states by any statutes, and no
laws can change their character. Nor is
there any need that they should now or
ever be converted intq American states.
We are committed to two duties: we
have by conquest taken upon ourselves
a solemn obligation to the people of the
conquered islands to insure stable gov-
ernment, and the nature of our institu-
tions forbids that we should set up any
form of government except one that at
the earliest possible moment shall become
self-government. Even if we wished we
could not shirk these responsibilities.
We cannot leave the people of these
islands either to their own fate, or to the
mercy of the now defeated and disorgan-
ized Spanish rule, or yet to the mercy of
any predatory nation that might seize
them. We are become responsible for
their development.
	Precisely what form the government
of these several islands ought to take
can be determined only after careful
study of their people and conservative
experiment with them; but to predict
that we shall make a failure in the effort
to prepare them for self-government is
a childish distrust of our capacity. We
have never had a task just like this, but
we have had tasks more difficult. Nor
will our undertaking such a task involve
us in entanglements with European na-
tions  if we succeed. The European
nations, it so happens, will look with
somewhat greater respect upon American
efforts at the government even of Manila
than they would have looked six months
ago. But without too great regard to
European opinion it becomes our duty
solemnly and patriotically now to take our
new duties and responsibilities in hand,
and, as a great nation committed to one
great policy of government, to work out</PB></P>

a childish distrust of our capacity. We
have never had a task just like this, but
we have had tasks more difficult. Nor
will our undertaking such a task involve
us in entanglements with European na-
tions  if we succeed. The European
nations, it so happens, will look with
somewhat greater respect upon American
efforts at the government even of Manila
than they would have looked six months
ago. But without too great regard to
European opinion it becomes our duty
solemnly and patriotically now to take our
new duties and responsibilities in hand,
and, as a great nation committed to one
great policy of government, to work out</PB>

these problems for the advancement of
civilization. The great Republic can
have no tribute-bearing colonies; but it
can help weak people to self-government.
	And it will be found that the govern-
ment of each island will present itself,
not as it now presents itself to the timid,
as a task involving revolutionary dan-
gers to ourselves and complications with
all the other governments of the world,
and a denial of the doctrines of the fa-
thers, but rather as a practical task that
practical and patriotic men can success-
fully accomplish.
	The main result of the war, the free-
dom of Cuba from Spanish misrule, has
been achieved, but the full fruits of it
will ripen more slowly than most men at
first supposed. Sympathy with the Cu-
ban insurgents had led many persons to
regard them as capable at once of self-
government; but the conduct of a part
of them during the war has confirmed
the judgment of those men who knew
them best,  that the removal of Span-
ish rule will not immediately nor easily
lead to the self - government of Cuba.
The complete conquest of the island by
civilization will be accomplished through
American industry and commerce, which
will now follow American arms. Brig-
ands are as certain where roads are lack-
ing as rebellion where government is op-
pressive. But the future of Cuba pre-
sents no insuperable difficulties, though
its subjection to civilization may require
a considerable time. In his proclamation
concerning the government of Santiago,
the President indicated the proper course
to pursue: local government to be per-
mitted, to be required, in fact; the Unit-
ed States to maintain military control so
long as military control is necessary for
the security of life and property, but to
relax it, and at last to give it up, when
a competent local government has been
created and tested. The process will
not be very different in principle from
the process of the reconstruction of the
local governments of the Southern States
thirty years ago. If the Cubans do not
at first show capacity for self-govern-
ment, the certain increase of American
influence and even of American popula-
tion in the island will greatly hasten its
coming. The engineer will follow the
soldier. The harbor of Havana will be
opened to the Gulf Stream,  a neces-
sary and easy piece of sanitary work that
the Spaniards have been going to do for
a century; the cities will be properly
drained, and yellow fever will be elimi-
nated from the scourges of our own
shores. Cuba will present no very seri-
ous difficulty till the time comes when it
may wish to be admitted into the Amer-
ican Union as a state. But such a wish
is not a sufficient reason for its admission.
	And the same plan whereby local self-
government will be built up in Cuba will
apply, with modifications, to Porto Rico.
One island will become an independent
territory under our guardianship; the
other will be directly ceded to us. But
the essential elements of their govern-
ment under our tutelage must be the
same, for the moral obligations that we
have assumed are the same, and there
is but one great principle of government
that we can adhere to. How much ter-
ritory it may be wise to retain in the
Philippine Islands it is impossible to
foresee; but the principle that should
govern our action is clear. We want no
colonies, can indeed have no co1o~
nies, in the continental sense; but we
must fulfill every obligation to Spain~ $
conquered subjects that our conduct of
the war in Asiatic waters has put upon
us, without regard to the colonizing am-
bitions of the European nations; and we
shall hardly fail, moreover, to keep what-
ever strategic advantage our navy has
won, in either ocean.
	The war, then, brings within the sphere
of English - speaking civilization two of
the most valuable of the Antilles; inci-
dentally the Hawaiian Islands, and per-
haps a part of the Philippine group: and
these results can be only good. But in</PB>

achieving them we have achieved other
results quite as great, and no less great
because they were unexpected.
	We have recovered our own national
feeling. Four months ago, we were a
great mass of people rather than a com-
pact nation conscious of national strength
and unity. By forgetting even for this
brief time our local differences, we have
welded ourselves into a conscious unity
such as the Republic has not felt since
its early days. Not only have the North
and the South forgotten that they were
ever at war,  for time and industry
had already wellnigh brought this result,
 but the Pacific states are nearer to
the rest of the Union than they ever were
before, and the great middle West is no
longer estranged from the seaboard. We
can work out our own problems and build
our own future with a steadier purpose.
	This consciousness is the keener be-
cause of the increased respect that other
nations have for us. The United States
was never before understood in official
Europe, perhaps not even in official Eng-
land. When the war was begun, most
of the Continental nations failed to con-
ceal their contempt of us: they now re-
spect us as they never dreamed they
should. Nor is it only our naval victo-
ries that have given the world a some-
what new conception of the United States.
Quite as impressive has been the absence
of the old-time barbarities of war and of
warlike vindictiveness. To send home
across the ocean a captured army, to
parole the officers of a captured squad-
ron, to feed not only the victims of Span-
ish misrule, but the Spanish themselves,
have laid emphasis on other reasons for
war than the old reasons of the punish-
ment of enemies and the conquest of
tribute-bearing territory. In humanity
to the enemy this war is without parallel.
Both the power and the aims of the Re-
public are more clearly understood in
Europe than a half. century of peace
could have revealed them, and (in no
spirit of boastfulness) we might add the
American character, also.
	It is to be hoped, too, that we have
had some effect on the medimeval diplo-
macy of Europe. We have often been
called blunt and discourteous in our dip-
lomacy,  no doubt with truth; for Eu-
ropean diplomacy is a dilatory art, that
has always been as courteous as it has
usually been mendacious. Ministers have
seldom said what they or their masters
meant. Now, if the dealings of civi-
lized governments with one another are
ever to advance beyond evasion and cun-
ning, the old diplomacy must change to
republican directness and frankness. It
need not take on discourtesy in manner,
but it must speak the truth and keep
faith. If we have even in slight measure
discredited the old mendacious and dila-
tory methods, we have done something
toward furthering political civilization.
	Nor will the impulse that asserted it-
self in the war stop with the war. The
spirit of the people once having looked
outward, American enterprise will seek
new fields of conquest,  not by arms,
but by trade and legitimate adventure.
Our navy has revealed to ourselves not
less than to the rest of the world our
rightful place among the nations. Mod-
ern transportation, which we have done
most to develop, has changed all interna-
tional political conditions. By reason of
it we are already  entangled with other
peoples, in ways that the fathers could
not foresee and that no policy can pre-
vent. The great outward pressure that
all nations feel is the pressure of com-
merce for new markets; and statesmen,
whether they know it or not, minister to
trade, and through trade to civilization.
With larger anti further-reaching polit-
ical duties, too, which appeal to the im-
agination rather than to the private greed
of men, our public life will once more
rise to the level of statesmanship.</PB></P>

THE ANGLO-AMERICAN FRIENDSHIP.

	ONE of the weightiest passages in
Washingtons Farewell Address is that
in which he warns the American peo-
ple as to permanent inveterate antipa-
thies against particular nations, and pas-
sionate attachments for others. The
loss of an unreasoning prejudice is al-
ways a distinct gain, especially to a na-
tion whose politics are governed by pub-
lic opinion. We may therefore count
the disappearance of the old blind An-
glophobia, and the vanishing of the trade
of the demagogue who would demon-
strate his superior patriotism by merely
twisting the British lions tail, as one
of the decidedly good results of our
Spanish war. The American people are
now getting into a state of mind which
will enable them to consider their rela-
tions with Great Britain with candid dis-
eernment, without doing injustice to the
feelings they formerly entertained.
	There have always been many Amer-
icans, indeed, who cherished a very warm
sympathy for the mother country, partly
owing to family sentiment, partly to the
belief that England is among the na-
tions of the Old World the most consis-
tent representative of those principles of
civil liberty of which this republic claims
to be the completest embodiment; that,
whatever criticism her conduct may in
many respects have deserved, no nation
has done more to carry light into the
dark places of the world, and to sup-
plant barbarism with order and pro-
gress; and that if, in doing this, she
served her own interests,  sometimes
with rough disregard of the feelings and
claims of others,  on the whole, she
served also the general interest of man-
kind. But the traditional education of
the masses in America still kept most
prominently before the popular mind the
memories of the Revolutionary war and
of the war of 1812, in which Great Brit-
ain appeared mainly as the oppressor
of the colonies and the ruthless tyrant
of the seas, and as the only really male-
v6lent and dangerous enemy the Ameri-
cans had ever had to fight. These mem-
ories were aggravated by the impression
produced upon the American mind by
the attitude of Great Britain during our
civil conflict; and this impression was so
strong that some of the men who until
then had been among the warmest admir-
ers and friends of England were much
shaken in their attachment.
	It is not unnatural, therefore, that a
large number of Americans should have
continued to think of Great Britain as
the hereditary enemy, who would still
be capable of any mischief if opportu-
nity offered, and that the politicimvn in
quest of cheap popularity should have
found in vociferous denunciation of that
enemy a device sure to draw applause.
But this was no excuse for the persons
in important public position who, having
ample facilities for information at their
disposal, knew better, or at least should
have known better, but who pretended
to see perfidious Albion lurking behind
every bush, dagger in hand, watching for
a propitious moment to strike us to the</PB>

heart, or to rob us of our valuables, 
Senators who would insist that if we
lost a moment in taking the Hawaiian
Islands, Great Britain would surely
snatch them from us; or that it was
altogether owing to diabolical British
intrigues if we did not get on with the
Nicaragua canal; or that we must punish
Great Britain with tariff discriminations
for maliciously maintaining the single
gold standard, and thus preventing the
establishment of universal bimetallism
which we needed so much; or that we
must not have an arbitration treaty with
Great Britain that amounted to anything,
because Great Britain would surely de-
rive the only advantage from it at our
expense. Indeed, we may congratulate
ourselves that the jingoes of that ex-
treme school did not succeed in making
a serious quarrel out of some slight mat-
ter of difference, which they sometimes
seemed morbidly anxious to do. Not
to believe in British hostility constantly
at work against us was to them a proof
of a lack of American patriotism, and
there was real danger that this sinister
influence  was it infatuation or dema-
gogy ?  would sometime get this re-
public into grave trouble with a power
which, whatever its disposition may have
been at other periods, certainly did not
now wish to quarrel with us.
	Then came the Spanish war and the
demonstrative display of British sympa-
thy with the United States. Even the
most inveterate Anglophobist was bound
to admit that if Great Britain had been
watching for an opportunity to hurt this
republic, her time to take advantage of
its embarrassment had come, and that
if, under such circumstances, she proved
herself not only not hostile, but positive-
ly friendly, the old cries could not be
sustained. The employment of the old-
style anti-British jingo is evidently gone;
and the American people will do well to
remember the untrustworthiness of those
public men whose unsound judgment or
lack of good faith so long insisted upon
it that an offensive attitude toward Great
Britain was a test of American states-
manship. Such statesmen should hence-
forth command no more confidence than
in so important a matter they have shown
themselves to deserve.
	As to the sincerity of the British friend-
ship for us, Mr. James Bryce, whose wide
knowledge of men and affairs, whose
high character, and whose well - known
friendly feeling for this country and its
people are entitled to the highest re-
spect, told us, in a recent article in The
Atlantic Monthly, that even during our
civil war, when the attitude of Great
Britain was so much complained of,
the masses of the people [in England]
hoped for the victory of the North, be-
cause they felt that the North stood for
human rights and freedom; that, in-
deed, the bulk of the wealthier classes
of England, and the newspapers written
for those classes, did in those days say
many offensive things regarding the
United States, and sometimes conveyed
the impression  erroneous though that
impression was  that England as a
whole had ranged herself on the side
of the Southern Confederacy; that those
wealthier classes erred so grievously
partly from ignorance, partly from
their own political proclivities, which
were not generally for freedom;  that
since 1863 Britain has passed through
gre at political changes ;  that  parlia-
mentary suffrage has been so extended
as now to include the immense majority
of the working classes; that now the
masses which during our civil war were
friendly to the Union, while their senti-
ment told very little on the wealthy and
the newspapers which the wealthy read,
have become politically predominant,
and public opinion has adapted itself to
the new conditions; in other words, that
Britain at large has become friendly to
the United States because it has become
more democratic.
	All this is undoubtedly true; but more
is to be said. Before the period of our</PB>

civil war this republic was looked upon
by many of the ruling class in England
as an experiment of uncertain result.
They had no confidence in the self-sus-
taining power of democratic government,
and they expected that some time, most
likely owing to the troubles bred by the
slavery question, the Union would be
broken to pieces. They were not quite
sure whether the interests of Great Brit-
ain might not on the whole be best
served by a disruption of the Union, for
the reason that if the union remained un-
broken it might in various ways become
a dangerous rival and competitor of the
mother country. In this state of mind,
they were rather disposed to welcome the
Southern Confederacy as the means for
dividing the United States into several
comparatively harmless fragments. But
when the Union issued from that crisis
stronger than ever, they promptly re-
cognized the fact that this republic was
bound to be a permanent institution and
a very great power, apt to become ex-
ceedingly useful as a friend, and ex-
ceedingly uncomfortable as an enemy.
From that time it came to be the first
precept~of British statesmanship  even
with most of those who would have shed
no tears had the Union been disrupted 
to remain on good terms with the United
States at almost any cost. Witness the
sacrifice of British pride in the Alabama
arbitration as well as in the Venezuela
case. Mr. Bryce himself approaches a
recognition of this fact in the article above
mentioned, when, after having spoken of
the political isolation of Great Britain, he
says: In this state of facts, England
has been forced to look round and con-
sider with which of the four other world
powers she has most natural affinity, and
with which of them there is the least like-
lihood of any clash of interests. That
one is unquestionably the United States.
It does not detract from the claim to sin-
cerity of the British friendship, or from
its value, that there is this consideration
of interest in it. On the contrary, if the
interest is a mutual and a well - under-
stood one, so much the better. It will
make the friendship all the more natural
and durable. Neither do I think that
the exchange of complimentary phrases
which has become customary, about kin-
ship, common origin, common love of
liberty, common language, common lit-
erature, about blood being thicker than
water and so on, is mere worthless stage
claptrap and flumnmery. There is enough
truth and sincerity in it to create and
keep alive a real sentiment; and while
those are mistaken who think interna-
tional relations may be wholly governed
by mere sentiment, those are equally mis-
taken who think that sentiment is no force
at all in international relations. As is
everything that promotes peace and good
will among nations, so this sentiment of
kinship between the American nation and
the British is well worth cultivating. It
may do very good service in facilitating
the cot~peration of the two nations where
their interests or objects are in accord,
as well as in preventing serious quarrels
between them about differences which
are not vital.
	The question is how the friendly rela-
tions which came about in so natural a
way can be made to endure, and to yield
the best possible fruit to the parties con-
cerned and to mankind at large. An
English statesman of high standing, who
may be regarded as a sincere friend of
this republic, is credited with saying in
effect that if the Anglo-American friend-
ship were to result substantially in a co-
operation of the American jingoes with
the British jingoes, it would be a curse
rather than a blessing. I accept this with-
out reserve, and add that such a friend-
ship would not endure. If the United
States and Great Britain, believing their
combined strength to be superior to that
of any probable combination against
them, were to set out to conquer and di-
vide the earth, or at least the largest pos-
sible part thereof, they would inevitably
soon fall out among themselves about the</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00442" SEQ="0442" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="436">	436	The Anglo-American Friendship.
distribution of the spoil. No league of
two such powers, formed in that spirit
and for such purposes, could possibly last
long. Nor would the common origin,
and the common language and literature,
and the common principles of civil liber-
ty, and all the other elements of kinship
serve to hold it together. It is a well-
known fact that a family fend about
property is apt to be more bitter and re-
lentless than any other kind of quarrel,
and that a friendship formed after long
dissension, and then broken again, is
among the most difficult to mend. I
should say, therefore, that if the United
States and Great Britain are to remain
friends, they must carefully avoid coin-
mon enterprises in which theirambitions
are likely to clash. If they do not, they
will be in danger of drifting into en-
mities far more virulent and far more
calamitous than any that have existed
between them hitherto.
	For the same reason they should keep
clear of any arrangements calculated to
make them dependent upon each other
as to the maintenance, respectively, of
their interests or their position in the
family of nations. A consciousness of
such dependence would be apt to en-
gender just that kind of suspicion, of
misgiving, which is most dangerous to
international friendship. I can best il-
lustrate my meaning by inviting atten-
tion to something that is now going on.
Many Englishmen are assiduously en-
couraging the Anmerican people to launch
out on what is currently called an im-
perial policy, and to this end to keep
in their possession the territories con-
quered from Spain, especially the Philip-
pine Islands. It is quite evident that if
this republic undertakes to hold such pos-
sessions, it becomes at once entangled in
the jealousies and quarrels of European
powers, of which colonial acquisition in
that part of the world is the principal
object. It is equally evident that while,
with our vast resources, we are capable
of creating and maintaining military
and naval armaments strong enough to
enable this republic to hold its own in
these complications, single-handed and
alone, our present armaments are not at
all sufficient for that purpose. Nor is
it certain that a majority of the Amer-
ican people, upon sober consideration of
the matter, would wish to set and keep
on foot armaments so extensive and cost
ly.	Now some of our British friends
substantially tell us: Never mind that.
You just start in the imperial business,
and take and keep the Philippines and
whatever else. We have plenty of ships,
and if you get into trouble we will see
you through.
	This sounds well. But Englishmen
who sincerely desire a lasting friendship
between the United States and Great
Britain will not give us such seductive
advice, if they are wise; and it should
be observed that Mr. Bryce, who knows
the American people, does not join in
it.	Neither should the American peo-
ple obey such advice, if aside from other
reasons against the imperial policy they
have only the preservation of tIme friend-
ship with Great Britain in view. While
duly thankful for the kind offer, they
should remember that, under any circum-
stances, they should be careful not to put
themselves into situations the require-
ments of which would oblige them to de-
pend upon foreign aid, especially when
such dependence involves obligations in
return the extent of which it would be
difficult to measure in advance. True, the
dependence and the obligations might be
made mutual. An agreement between
the two nations, binding Great Britain to
protect the United States in the possession
of the Philippines, and the United States
to aid Great Britain in carrying certain
points in Asia, might seem fair in the
abstract, but prove otherwise in reality.
Any occasion for comparing the value
of the services due and the services ren-
dered, respectively, is dangerous to the
cordiality of international relations, es-
pecially when one of the nations con-</PB>

cerned is a democracy, which will al-
ways be disposed to measure much more
closely services which are asked for as
due, than services which it voluntarily
renders.
	Ou the whole, if we wish to keep our
friendship with Great Britain on a pro-
per and durable basis, we should con-
stantly remember that it is a very good
thing to have, but that we ought not to
be in a situation to need it. The more
spontaneous and unconstrained our re-
lations are, the more will the friendship
be likely to last.
	It is equally desirable that those who
have at heart the cultivation of the friend-
ship between the two nations should be
careful to abstain from exciting expec-
tations as to its practical results which
are not likely to be realized, and might
therefore produce chilling disappoint~
ments. There are some things about
which we are apt to delude ourselves,
when in a state of sentimental emotion;
and without the slightest desire to de-
preciate or discourage the feelings en-
tertained here as well as in England at
the present moment, it may be said that
we are in such a state of sentimental
emotion now.
	An example of the outcome of that
state of mind is furnished by the reso-
lutions adopted by the Anglo-American
League recently formed in London. The
recital in those resolutions that the peo-
ples of the United States and of England
are akin in language, literature, and
principles of government is very proper;
but when the resolutions go on to say
that the two nations are drawn together
	common interests in many parts of
the world, and ought therefore con-
stantly to co6perate, they touch doubt-
ful ground. What are those common
interests in many parts of the world,
to protect and promote which the two
nations should constantly  coilperate?
Any attempt to specify will meet with
difficulty. It might be said in a general
way that we have a common interest in
furthering the progress of civilization
wherever there is an opportunity for
such furtherance. But this is so vague
a proposition  a proposition open to so
great a variety of interpretations and in-
cluding so many different subjects that
no definite plan of codperation can be
based upon it. Its active application
would have to depend upon special
agreement in each separate emergency.
	We are told that it is the common
interest of the two nations to open the
markets of the world to their commerce,
and, by implication, to prevent, wherever
possible, the entire or partial closing of
any of them. This will be true as soon
as both nations agree in regarding free
trade as their common interest. But as
things now stand, consistent co~5pera-
tion between them would require, at
the outset, that our own ports should
be relieved of those high tariff duties
which to a great extent have hurt the
trade of Great Britain herself, and
which, if we should get any colonial
possessions while our protective policy
lasts, would to the same extent shut in
Great Britains face our colonial ports,
too; for, whatever arrangements we
may make at present by way of excep-
tional war measures, there will hardly
be a way in time of peace to get
around the constitutional mandate that
all duties, imposts, and excises shall be
uniform throughout the United States;
nor would the influences which now up-
hold the protective system with us per-
mit it. Thus it appears that in this re-
spect identity of interests between the
two nations depends upon identity of
commercial policy. Without this iden-
tity of commercial policy the relations
between Great Britain and the United
States, in this regard, will not differ
materially from the relations between
Great Britain and any other country,
inasmuch as it is the interest of every
country, whatever it may do with
its own ports, that every foreign port
should be wide open to its goods, and</PB>

therefore that Great Britain should hold
open to the whole world all the ports
which she controls.
	The American people will indeed con-
sider it in their interest, and be much
gratified, if Great Britain holds all her
ports open, and also if Great Britain,
rather than any less liberal power, gets
the largest possible number of ports to
hold open. But so long as our high pro-
tective policy prevails, the United States
will not be in a position to reciprocate
in kind; and it is doubtful, to say the
least, whether, if Great Britain were for
some reason attacked in any of the vast
and complicated territorial possessions in
which some of those open ports are situ-
ated, or if she should consider it proper
to extend the policy of the open door
by further conquests, the United States
would find it in their interest to join her
with their own armed forces. (I do not
mean to say that they should or that they
should not. In any event, they should
not be in a situation obliging them to
do so.)
	I mention these things to emphasize
the point that, however ardently we may
wish for a fruitful cot~peration between
this republic and Great Britain as to the
furtherance of the open door policy, as
well as in other directions, those who
value the preservation and development
of the cordial feeling at present existing
between the two nations should abstain
from encouraging presumptions and
hopes that may not be justified, and the
disappointment of which may have an
effect all the more chilling, the more
confidently they have been entertained.
It is much wiser frankly to recognize
the fact that while the Americans and
the English are of kin in many impor-
tant respects, and while they can and
should do much in harmonious concur-
rence for the advancement of human civi-
lization, their spheres of action are not
the same.
	We are in the habit of speaking of
the Americans and the English as of
two branches of the Anglo-Saxon stock.
Considering the mixtures of popular ele-
ments that have occurred first in Eng-
land, and then, on a much larger scale,
in America, this view must be taken with
a grain of allowance. However, for
the sake of convenience, we may accept
the term Anglo-Saxon as covering that
mixed race iii which the Germanic blood
is the prevailing strain, and apply it to
all that the English and American peo-
ples may have in common. But how-
ever much they may have in common
in origin, in temperament, in tradition,
in language and literature, it does not
follow that these two great branches
of the Anglo-Saxon stock must, there-
fore, necessarily be engaged in the same
pursuits; that they have exactly the
same kind of work to do in and for the
world; that in order to fulfill her duty,
the American republic must imitate the
example of England as to the means to
be employed and the immediate objects
to be reached; and that, for instance, as
England is a great sea power and the
founder of many colonies, the United
States must also be a great sea power
and found or acquire colonies. The
difference in their territorial conditions
naturally determined the difference in
their respective methods of achieving
greatness.
	The English people, originally con-
fined to a comparatively small island,
had to be a great sea power in order to
be a power at all. Even now, if they
permitted any other power to command
the waters around that island they would
enable such a power to starve them in a
short space of time. Their independence,
their very existence, therefore, hangs
upon the superiority of their fleets. To
	rule the waves is with them not a
mere matter of policy or of pride, but
of necessity.
	As the population of their island in-
creased it began to press against its nar-
row boundaries; and as those bounda-
ries were formed by the sea, the English</PB>

people had to cross the sea in order to
find elbow room for their energies. It
was not alone the Anglo-Saxon tempera-
ment, the spirit of adventurous enterprise,
but also the exigencies of their situation
that impelled them to wander across the
waters and to spread over the globe.
The founding of colonies and the estab-
lishment of governments over subject
populations was with them a perfectly
natural evolution.
	The condition of the American people
is essentially different. They are one of
the resulting creations of that transplant-
ing process. They were placed, not upon
a small isle, but upon an immense wild
continent, which they had to subjugate to
civilized life. They had to explore the
vast resources of the great country as-
signed to them, and to begin and continue
their development. They had to receive
among themselves large numbers of peo-
ple of different nationalities, who came
to share with them the new opportunities
for the pursuit of happiness. They had
to assimilate those elements of popula-
tion, and to undertake with them the
solution of the problem of democracy
on the largest scale. In the develop-
ment of those resources and in the solu-
tion of the great democratic experiment
the American people are engaged to-day.
Their population is still small in propor-
tion to the vastness of their country. The
resources of that country are still, to a
very large extent, not only undeveloped,
but even unexplored. They still offer,
and for a long period of time will offer,
ample and fruitful employment for the
national energies. Neither is the great
problem of democratic government, based
upon equal rights and universal suffrage
in the nation, in the states, and in the
municipalities, so near a successful solu-
tion that the American people may con-
sider themselves discharged of this their
greatest responsibility, and seek other
missions to fulfill without regard to it
	The difference in the conditions of the
peoples of England and of America, or
 to use the favorite phrase of the day
 of the two great branches of the
Anglo - Saxon stock, is evident. The
Americans need not become a great
conquering sea power in order to be a
power at all, for they are a great power
in the vast population and the immense
resources of their continental country, 
and they would be a great power even if
they were not in any large measure a sea
power. In fact, considering that in their
continental situation they are essential-
ly unassailable, the only weak points
they have consist in such outlying pos-
sessions as the Hawaiian Islands, which
demand that the republic should be a
great sea power. To such weak points,
which it ought not to have, it is under
no necessity of adding. The Americans
do not, like the English, crowd against
narrow boundaries, nor need they go
abroad to gratify their ambition of ac-
tivity or of missionary work, for that
ambition finds an almost unlimited field
at home. Indeed, within a computable
period of time the United States may
expect to have within their great conti-
nental home a population as numerous as
the British Empire has in England and
all its colonial possessions together; a
population, too, far more civilized and
far happier than a majority of those that
are ruled by the British sceptre,  an
expectation the fulfillment of which will
depend upon the fidelity of the American
people in maintaining the character and
developing the blessings of democratic
government in the magnificent domain
which has fallen to their care. It may
well be asked whether any effort they
may make to plant their power outside
of its boundaries will not be so much
energy reprehensibly withdrawn from
their most imperative task, and an in-
crease of the difficulties standing in the
way of the performance of their true
mission.
	As to the furtherance of civilization
and human happiness, therefore, the
two branches of the Anglo-Saxon stock</PB>

may very effectively work for the same
object without working on the same field
of action. There are even many reasons
for thinking it best for themselves as well
as for mankind that they should, as little
as possible, meet as active agents where
their coi~peration might turn into rivalry
and their ambitions might come into con-
flict. Those of our English friends who
are at present so extremely impatient to
see this republic become a colonizing
power, and thus put itself under the
necessity of building up and maintaining
great armaments on land and sea, would
do well soberly to consider whether
they are really rendering a service to
the cause of that international friend-
ship from which so much good may be
expected if it be kept on a proper foot-
ing. Aside from the fact that the ex-
cessive urgency of their advice might
produce the effect of impugning its dis-
interestedness,  which would be regret-
table,  they should most seriously ask
themselves whether they are not trying
to divert the minds of the American
people from the problem the solution
of which is most vital to them and, if
successfully accomplished, will he most
beneficial to mankind; and to lure this
republic upon a ground which is foreign
to its natural tendencies, and on which
that very international friendship aimed
at would be exposed to incalculable haz-
ards.
	One point of exceedingly great value
is already gained. The old distrust be-
tween the United States and Great Brit-
ain has disappeared as a power of mis-
chief. Whatever either of the nations
may do, the other will readily believe it
to be prompted by good faith and friend-
ly intention as to the relations between
them. And whenever either gets into
trouble, the presumption will be that the
other, if disposed actively to interfere at
all, will interfere on its side, or, if by its
own interests compelled to remain neu-
tral, will maintain a thoroughly sympa-
thetic neutrality. This may eventually
open the way to further understandings;
but it is in itself a result of such impor
tance that, I repeat, the mutual confidence
necessary for its maintenance should not
be jeoparded by precipitate attempts at
arrangements by which either of the two
nations would lose the mastery of its own
destinies.
	As to the manner in which the friend-
ly feeling now existing can be given a
tangible expression, Mr. Bryce has made
some valuable suggestions. The first
thing to be accomplished is the conclu-
sion of an arbitration treaty covering all
kinds of differences, and thus recogniz-
ing that no quarrels can possibly arise
between the two nations which would
not be capable of amicable composition,
and that under no circumstances will any
less pacific method of settlement be de-
sired on either side. In fact, the amend-
ments disfiguring beyond recognition the
arbitration treaty which two years ago
was before the Senate, and its final de-
feat, were the last effective stroke of
the old anti-British jingoism, for which
amends should now be made by a prompt
resumption of negotiations for the accom-
plishment of that great object. In this
way the Anglo-American friendship will
signalize itself to the world by an act
that will not only benefit the two coun-
tries immediately concerned, but set an
example to other nations which, if gen-
erally followed, will do more for the
peace and happiness of mankind and the
progress of civilization than anything that
can be effected by armies and navies.

ENGLAND AND AMERICA.

	A YEAR has passed since I delivered a

It was inopportune. It excited no at-

me a few friendly letters from the

in which he asked the question, Why

I dare say, but in a way not calculated

ple. The opposition has brought many
charges, true or false, against Lord Salis-

gle leading member of Parliament who
has blamed his lordship for friendliness

to me occasionally that I had deferred
my proposal for a common citizenship

a perfectly sound and reasonable sug-

manded an attention, and possibly an ap-
plause, which did not fall to it in 1897.

<PB REF="IMG00448" SEQ="0448" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="442">	44~	England and America.
	The first fact is that community of
race, of language, and of institutions has
produced in England and America a com-
munity of ideals. We have infinitely
more in common with each other than
either of us has with any other nation.
We are both devoted to industrial pro-
gress. We are both naval rather than
military powers. We have both reason to
look with hopefulness toward the future.
We perceive that the English-speaking
peoples are destined in a century or two
to become the dominant power through-
out the civilized world. Their future su-
premacy is as nearly certain as any future
event can be. The only risk to which it
is exposed is the possibility of a quarrel
between the two great branches of the
Anglo - Saxon people. We are aware
that at this moment England and Amer-
ica, if allied, or even if on terms of equal
friendship, without actual alliance, can
control the course of the worlds history.
Together we may be masters of the sea;
and to have control of the sea means ab-
solute security against foreign attack.
	It is the vision of this splendid future
which has at last fired the imagination
of Englishmen, and led them to resolve
to maintain at all costs friendship be-
tween the different branches of the An-
glo-Saxon race, and thus safeguard the
inheritance of the whole English people.
This is a fact patent to every observer.
	The second fact, of equal importance,
is the difficulty of maintaining a perma-
nent alliance between England and any
Continental power.
	Things have changed greatly since the
beginning of the century. England is
now little interested in Continental poli-
tics. Unless one of the great military
governments should threatea invasion,
it is hardly conceivable that, as things
now stand, England should equip an
army to take part in a European war.
But the very circumstances which with-
draw England from Continental alliances
may conceivably suggest combinations of
Continental powers for the destruction
of England. Her empire excites their
envy; they believe (erroneously enough)
that her commercial success is the result
of a Machiavelian policy of selfish isola-
tion, and they see that parts of the Brit-
ish Empire are open to attack. English-
men, on their side, know that a great em-
pile can be guarded only at the price of
maintaining large forces for its protec-
tion. It is not for nothing that England
every year increases the strength of her
fleet. It is perfectly natural, therefore,
that friendship with America should be
suggested by the most obvious consider-
ations of statesmanlike foresight. The
point which needs to be pressed home
upon American readers is that the atti-
tude of England toward the United States
is not the result of any sudden ebullition
of sentiment. It represents a set purpose
pursued by English statesmen of all par-
ties for the whole of a generation.
	Of American sentiment I have said
nothing. The true condition of opinion
in the United States must be much bet-
ter known to Americans than it can be
to any Englishman. At the present mo-
ment, however, it is reasonable to as-
sume that friendliness toward England
prevails throughout the United States.
This sentiment, though its expression
may appear to Englishmen a little sud-
den, is clearly the result of definitely as-
signable causes, some of which have long
been in operation. There is every sign
that the United States are entering on a
policy which, whether for good or for
bad, will involve a much closer connec-
tion than has hitherto existed between
their fortunes and the complications of
European politics. If this be so, the
United States will need allies for the
first time since they became an indepen-
dent nation, and no ally will be at once
so valuable and so little dangerous as
England. The hour is opportune for pro-
moting friendliness between two coun-
tries, neither of which can have any ade-
quate ground for hostility, and each of
which may need the others aid.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00449" SEQ="0449" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="443">	England and America.	443
	How can this opportunity be best
turned to account?
	Whoever wishes to answer this ques-
tion must be on his guard against one
or two popular delusions. Let no one,
for instance, suppose that far-reaching
policies can be grounded upon the senti-
mental emotion of the moment. Grati-
tude, affection, and love are feelings pro-
per to individuals. They have nothing
to do with the relations between states.
This assertion has in it no touch of cyn-
icism. It is the simple statement of the
plain fact that personal feelings belong
to persons, not to nations. Half, at least,
of the errors of popular politics arise from
the fallacy of personification. We talk
of England and America as if they were
two women, each of whom could love or
hate the other; and we forget that Eng-
land and America, when not used as the
names of geographical divisions, are sim~
ply terms for designating millions of men
and women living on opposite sides of
the Atlantic, and personally unknown to
one another. Such millions cannot, if
they would, be actuated by gratitude or
love. The suggestions of reason are am-
ply confirmed by the experience of his-
tory. At the beginning of the century,
English blood and English treasure were
lavishly poured out to maintain the na-
tional independence of Spain; yet even
during the Peninsular war Spaniards had
no fervent love for England, and the
name of Great Britain is now as much
detested at Madrid as is the name of the
United States. Not forty years have
passed since France delivered Lombardy
from the Austrians; yet at this moment
Italians dread, and therefore dislike,
France far more than they fear or dislike
Austria. Nations are not ruled by senti-
mentality, and no man of common sense
will dream of making sentiment the ba-
sis of international policy.
	Let us again be well on our guard
against the delusion that the interests
of England and America will always
obviously coincide. It is indeed true
that, on the whole and in the long run,
the real interests of both nations are
identical. To maintain peace at sea, to
subject naval warfare to the rules which
best promote the development of com-
merce, to foster trade, to avoid as far as
possible the burden of standing armies,
 these are objects which the two great
industrial states of the modern world
can pursue in common. These are mat-
ters in which no conflict of interests
ought to arise. But to make this asser-
tion is a very different thing from im-
agining that at no given moment can
there be an apparent opposition between
the wishes and the interests of the two
nations. If, indeed, England and Amer-
ica are ever to be united by the bonds of
what may be called a moral alliance, it
is absolutely certain that when one ally
requires the support of the other, there
will need to be a certain immediate sac-
rifice made by whichever party is called
upon for help. It is vain to suppose that
the permanent relations of two states can
be based on the untenable assumption of
an unvarying coincidence of interests.
	Let us also be watchful against the er-
rors of hastiness. The idea prevails, for
example, that it is possible at once to
constitute some kind of formal alliance
between Great Britain and the United
States. It would be the greatest satis-
faction to thousands of Englishmen to
believe that this notion is well founded;
but to any one who reflects upon the
state of the world, it must appear ex-
tremely doubtful whether, at this time,
it would be possible for England and the
~United States to enter into a treaty for
the purpose of mutual defense. What
would be the precise terms of such an
agreement? Is it conceivable that the
republic would guarantee England
against attack, say, by France, Germany,
or Russia on any part of the British
Empire? Would England undertake to
make every dispute of the United States
with any one of the great European pow-
ers her own quarrel? No one who thinks</PB>

the matter over dare answer these or sim-
ilar inquiries in the affirmative. Every
tie is a bond; a contract limits the free-
dom of the contracting parties. We may
gravely doubt if either England or Amer-
ica is prepared to curtail her own liberty
of action. Then, again, there are tech-
nical difficulties which, however, in case
of urgent necessity might be overcome,
in the way of constructing a defensive
alliance. rrhe conventions of English po-
litical life do not absolutely forbid enter-
ing into elaborate and private compacts
with a foreign state, but they certainly
render it difficult. A writer in one of
our reviews, who professes to be versed
in the mysteries of diplomacy, hints that
Great Britain and the United States have
already established some sort of secret
contract or understanding. It would be
satisfactory to believe in the reality of
such a transaction; but a lawyer would
find it somewhat difficult to explain by
what steps such a treaty can have been
made in conformity with the Constitu-
tion of the United States. The truth is,
that neither the constitutional conven-
tions of England nor the definite provi-
sions of the American Constitution lend
themselves easily to the exigencies of
elaborate and private diplomatic ar-
rangements. One may hope that lasting
friendliness may ultimately produce an
open and permanent alliance, and any
statesman deserves applause who de-
clares openly that the formation of such
an alliance would be a blessing both to
England and to America. But to be-
lieve that a treaty for mutual defense
has been entered into, or can at this mo-
ment be entered into, by Great Britain
and the United States, is to confound
hopes with realities. There is, at any
rate, some danger that the premature
attempt to bring about a closer unity of
action than is now possible may prevent
our turning to account the advantages
offered to us by the circumstances of the
time.
	What, then, if we avoid all delusions,
are the steps by which it is possible to
promote active good will between Eng-
lani and America?
	The first and most obvious step is to
put an end to every existing grievance.
	On this matter, the government of
Lord Salisbury, as indeed any ministry
which could hold office in England, may
be trusted to do its best. We may rea-
sonably hope that before many months
are past every cause of misunderstand-
ing will have been removed.
	A second, and equally obvious mea-
sure, is to carry through an arbitration
treaty.
	Dissensions between nations cannot
always be removed by arbitration, it is
true; but for all this, it is most expedi-
ent that England and the United States
institute a method for determining dis-
putes by reference to a court. The
points of difference likely to arise are of
the kind to which arbitration is applica-
ble. Englishmen and Americans, more-
over, are profoundly influenced by the
spirit of legalism. They are better pre-
pared than Frenchmen or Germans to
acquiesce in the judgment of a properly
constituted tribunal: this, indeed, is the
main point on which the Anglo-Saxon
race has reached a stage of civilization to
which other nations have hardly attained.
Add to all this that the very existence of
an agreement to arbitrate fosters the con-
viction that an armed conflict between
kindred people is in itself an enormity,
which partakes of the horror and the
moral criminality attaching to civil war.
	But after all, thinkers who are firmly
convinced that the prosperity not only
of the whole English people, but also
of the civilized world, depends on the
maintenance of cordial friendship be-
tween the two great divisions of tho
Anglo-Saxon race, must feel on reflec-
tion that more is to be achieved by
statesmanship than by direct treaties of
any kind whatever. The object which

	AFTER several visits in Scotland during
the summer of 1838, Carlyle went home
again to Scotsbrig. On his return thence,

for an hour or more. I grew impatient,
bolted out of bed, flung up the window.
Groo-o-o-o. There he was advancing,
lantern in hand, a few yards off me.
Cant you give up that noise? I hasti-
ly addressed him. You are keeping a
person awake. What good is it to go
howling and groaning all night, and de-
prive people of their sleep? He ceased
from that time  at least I heard no
more of him. No watchman, I think,
has been more astonished for some time
back. At five in the morning all was
as still as sleep and darkness. At half
past five all went off like an enormous
mill-race or ocean-tide. The Boom-in-in,
far and wide. It was the mills that were
all starting then, and creishy drudges
by the million taking post there. I have
heard few sounds more impressive to me
in the mood I was in.
	The following letter belongs to the time
between the Hannings departure from
Manchester and Mr. Hannings sailing
for America. Kirtlebridge, where they
were now living, is a few miles southeast
of Ecclefechan. The little trader,
the bit creeture, was probably Mrs.
Hannings first child, Margaret Aitken
Carlyle, who was not yet two years old.
The reference to the new penny post
marks an era.

XL CARLYLE TO MRS. HANNING, RIRTLEBRIDGE.

5 CHEYNE Row, CHELSEA, LONDON,

7 Feb. 1840.
	DEAR JENNY,  Had I known defi-
nitely how to address a word to you, I
might surely have done so long before
this. We have heard in general that
you are stationed somewhere in the Vil-
lage of Kirtlebridge or near it, and we
fancy in general that your husband is
struggling along with his old impetuosity.
From yourself we have no tidings. Pray,
now that the Postage is so cheap, send
us a pennyworth some day. I address
this through Alick, fancying such may
be the best way.
I enclose my last letter from the Doe-
tor. I wrote to him the day before yes-.
terday to his final destination. I calcu-
late he may have got my letter to-day,
that is two days after his arrival. By
that note all seems to be going well with
him;  we are all well here, as well as
our wont is, and fighting along with
printers, proof sheets &#38; c, &#38; c. Jane can-
not regularly get out; so horribly tem-
pestuous, wet and uncertain is the wea-
ther, which keeps her still sickly, but she
never breaks actually down. How is the
little trader, as Jean or some of theni
call her? I remember the bit cree-
ture very distinctly.
	This is the worst year or among the
worst for working people ever seen in
mans memory. Robert must not take
this as a measure of his future success,
but toil away steadfastly in sure hope of
better times. It is well anyway that you
are out of Manchester; nothing there
but hunger, contention and despair 
added to the reek and dirt! Be diligent
and fear nothing.
	Do you often run over to see our dear
Mother in her Upper Room yonder? It
will be a great comfort to her that she
has you so near. Pray explain to me
what part of the Village it is that yon
live in. I thought I knew it all, but I
do not know Firpark Nook. Give my
best wishes to your Goodman. Accept
my thanks for your written remem-
brance, from one who always silently
remembers you in his heart.

	On April 23 of this year Carlyle
wrote in his journal, Miscellanies out,
and Chartism second thousand. A
mouth later he relieved his mothers
anxiety about the last of his lectures on
Heroes and Hero-Worship: I contrived
to tell them something about poor Crom-
well, and I think to convince them that
he was a great and true man, the valiant
soldier in England of what John Knox
had preached in Scotland. In a word,
the people seemed agreed that it was my
best course of lectures, this. Certainly</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00453" SEQ="0453" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="447">	Unpublished Letters of Garlyle.	447
his last course of lectures, this. He
never spoke from a platform again till
twenty-six years later, when, as Lord
Rector, he addressed the students of
Edinburgh University. He detested the
mixture of prophecy and play-acting.
In the midst of his own work of making
ready these final lectures for publication,
Carlyle found time to push the London
Library along. He thought England,
as regarded its provision of books for
the poor, in a condition worthier of
Dahomey than of England.
	Yet, in spite of this good and success-
ful work for the library, Carlyle was of
a mind to write, on July 3: Alas!
I get so dyspeptical, melancholic, half
mad in the London summer: all cour-
age to do anything but hold my peace
fades away; I dwindle into the pusil-
lanimity of the ninth part of a tailor,
feel as if I had nothing I could do but
die in my hole like a poisoned rat.
He was apparently brought to the pitch
of applying to himself this most terrible
word of Swifts by the necessity of serv-
ing on a special jury. Let us set over
against it what he said  never to be
too often quoted  about a friend whom
he found sitting smoking in the garden
one evening, with Mrs. Carlyle: A
fine, large-featured, dim-eyed, bronze-
coloured, shaggy-headed man is Alfred;
dusty, smoky, free and easy, who swims
outwardly and inwardly with great com-
posure in an inarticulate element of
tranquil chaos and tobacco smoke. Great
now and then when he does emerge, 
a most restful, brotherly, solid-hearted
man. Taken together with what Ten-
nyson himself called the dirty monk
portrait, this probably gives a better pic-
ture of him than most of us could have
made for ourselves with the eye of the
flesh. Other, less welcome visitors came
to Carlyle that summer,  among them
a young woman from Boston, whom
he called a diseased rosebud. But
America sent money as well as flowers,
and the summer, according to Froude,
brought the net result up to four hundred
pounds.
	By August, the lecture-writing now
two thirds done, Carlyle, having so far
taken no holiday, made a weeks riding-
tour in Sussex on the back of the gift-
horse, Citoyenne. Mrs. Carlyle de-
scribed to us, some years after, says
the skilful biographer, in her hus-
bands presence, his setting out on this
expedition; she drew him in her finest
style of mockery,  his cloak, his knap-
sack, his broad-brimmed hat, his prepara-
tion of pipes, etc.,  comparing him to
Dr. Syntax. He laughed as loud as any
of us,  it was impossible not to laugh;
but it struck me, even then, that the wit,
however brilliant, was rather untender.
	On the eve of riding forth, Carlyle
wrote to his mother. The Bullers, men-
tioned in the letter which follows, were
the family of Charles Buller, to whom
he had been tutor. Buller died eight
years afterward, in the midst of a bril-
liant parliamentary career. The cler-
gyman was probably the Rev. Julius
Hare. I find no record of a visit to
Erskine until three years later. Carlyle
had written to his brother John, in the
winter of 1838: Did you ever see
Thomas Erskine, the Scotch saint? I
have seen him several times lately, and
like him as one would do a draught of
sweet rustic mead, served in cut glasses
and a silver tray; one of the gentlest,
kindliest, best bred of men. He talks
greatly about Symbols, and other Teu-
felsdriickhiana; seems not disinclined to
let the Christian religion pass for a kind
of mythus, provided men can retain the
5l)irit of it.. . . On the whole I take up
with my old love for the Saints. And
from that time Carlyle held much salu-
tary communion with St. Thomas, as
Mrs. Carlyle used playfully to call him.

XII.	cARLYLE TO HIS MOTHER, ScoTSBEIG.

CHELSEA, Ist August, 1840.
	Mv DEAR MOTHER,  Before setting
out on my long-talked-of excursion I</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00454" SEQ="0454" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="448">	448	Unpublished Letters of Carlyle.

must send you a word. I am to go to
the Bullers place to-morrow, a place
near Epsom (the great race course) some
eighteen miles off. I am to ride out with
a Macintosh before my saddle and a
small round trunk the size of a quartern
loaf fastened behind, and no clothes upon
me that bad weather will spoil. I shall
be one of the most original figures! I
mean to stay a day or two about Bul-
lers, riding to and fro to see the fine
green country. I have written to a cler-
gyman, an acquaintance of mine on the
South coast some 40 miles farther off:
if he repeat the invitation he once gave
me, perhaps I shall ride to him and see
the place where William the Conqueror
fought &#38; c. and have one dip in the sea.
I mean to be out in all about a week.
The weather has grown suddenly bright.
I calculate the sight of the green earth
spotted yellow with ripe corn will do me
good. After that I am to part with my
horse: the expense of it is a thing I can-
not but continually grudge. I think it
will suit better henceforth to get rolled
out on a railway some 20 miles, clear of
all bricks and reek, to walk then for half
a day, now and then, and so come home
at night again. The expense of a horse
every day here is nearer four than three
shillings, far too heavy for a little fellow
like me, whom even it does not make al-
together healthy. I have offered to give
the beast to Mr. Marshall (son of the
original donor), who kept her for me last
winter. I hope he will accept on my
return. It will be much the handsomest
way of ending the concern. If he refuses
I think I shall sell. I meditated long
on riding all the way up to Carlisle and
you! But in the humor I am in, I had
not heart for it. These Southern coasts
too are a still newer part of England for
me. I give up the riding Northward,
but not the coming Northward yet, as
you shall hear.
	My Fourth Lecture was finished three
days ago. On returning strong, as I
hope to do a week hence, I will attack
my two remaining lectures and dash
them off speedily. The Town will be
empty  none to disturb me. About
the end of August I may hope to have
my hands quite free, and then! Thomas
Erskine invites me to Dundee &#38; c. There
are steamers, steam coaches,  I shall
surely see you.
	Alicks good letter gave me welcome
tidings of you. I had read your own
dear little epistle before. Heaven be
praised for your welfare. I am glad to
hear of the peat-shed and figure to
myself the cauldron singing under your
windows. I have written to-day to Jack.
There had come a letter from Miss El-
liott for him from the Isle of Wight:
he once talked of settling there. I know
not whether that is still in the wind
again. He will have to decide about the
Pellipar affair in three weeks or less.
	To-day I enclose a little half sover-
eign. You must accept it merely to
buy gooseberries: they are really very
wholesome. I am to go into the City
to send off some money for the Bank at
Dumfries. I am in great haste. I will
write again directly on my return if not
sooner.
	Alicks letter, tell him, was the plea-
santest he has sent for many a day. I
thank him much for it and will answer
soon. I still owe Jamie a letter too: he
is very patient, but shall be paid. Did
you ever go near the sea again? This
is beautiful weather for it now. It would
do you and little Tom good, I think.
	Jane still likes the warmth and salutes
you all. Wish me a good journey! It
is like to be a very brief and smooth
one. Adieu, dear Mother.

	Carlyle was disappointed in his hope
of going home. He did not visit Scots-
brig again for another year.
	So long before as January, 1839, Car-
lyle had written to his brother: I have
my face turned partly towards Oliver
Cromwell and tbe Covenant time in
England and Scotland. He continued</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00455" SEQ="0455" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="449">	Unpublished Letters of Carlyle.	449
to read and think much on the subject;
and in the autumn of 1840 he wrote to
Mr. Erskine: I have got lately, not
till very lately, to fancy that I see in
Cromwell one of the greatest tragic souls
we have ever had in this kindred of
ours. But in this letter to his sister,
as in so many another, there is no men-
tion save of the close family kindred of
the Carlyles 

XIII. cARLYLE TO MRS. RANKING, KIRTLE
BRIDGE.

5 CHEYNE Row, CHELSEA, 7 October, 1840.

	IDEAR JENNY,  Will you take a
word from me to-day in place of many
hundreds which I wish I had the means
of sending you? My time is very lim-
ited indeed, but the sight of my hand-
writing may be a kind of enlivener
to your kind thoughts about me. My
dear Mother tells me you are afraid
sometimes I may have forgotten you.
Believe that never, my dear little sister,
it will forever be an error if you do!
The whirl I am kept in here is a thing
you can form no notion of, nor how nat-
ural or indeed inevitable it is for me to
give up writing letters at all except
when I am bound and obliged to do it.
You have no lack of news from me; to
my Mother at least I send abundant de-
tails. Did I not answer your letter
too? I surely meant and ought to have
done it. If at any time you wanted the
smallest thing that I could do for you,
and wrote about, I should be busier
than I have ever yet been, if I did
not answer.  In short, dear Jenny,
whatever sins I may have, whatever
more I may seem to have, try to think
handsomely of them, to forgive them.
And above all things, consider that
whether I write many letters or few, my
affection for you is a thing that will
never leave me.
	My Mother tells me frequently how
good you are to her; what a satisfac-
tion it is that you are so near her. I
thank you a hundred times for your
	VOL. LXXXII. NO. 492.	29
goodness to her; but I know you do not
need my thanks or encouragement 
and to me it is a real comfort to reflect
that you, with your true heart and help-
ful hand, are always so near. Surely it
is a duty for us all, and a blessing in
the doing of it, to take care of our
Mother, and promote her comfort by all
means possible to us! I will love you
better and better for this.
	Yoi~ would see by my Mothers last
letter, where the Doctor is at present. I
have heard nothing since I had a News-
paper from Dumfries, the other day, no
letters. I mentioned that the box for
Scotsbrig was to be sent off; it went ac-
cordingly and is now on the way to Liv-
erpool, likely to be with you soon. There
is a small parcel in it for you. We re-
joice to hear that Robert prospers in his
business: it is difficult to prosper in any
business at present. A man of indus-
try, sobriety, and steadiness of purpose;
such a man has a chance if anybody have.
Jane is certainly in better health this
year than I have seen her for a good while.
We wait to see what she will say to the
cold weather! I myself am as well as
usual; no great shakes of a welluess at
any time. I expect to be busy, very
busy this winter, which is the best con-
solation for all things. How I should
like to hear of Jamies harvest being all
thatched! My love to my Mother, to
Alick and all the rest. Jane unites
with me in special remembrances to
Robert and the gleg9v little lassie.
	Yours, dear Jenny, in great haste, in
all truth,
T.	CARLYLE.


	Late in November, Carlyle, great-
ly against wont, went out to dinner.
Among the people he met were Pick-
wick and old Rogers, still brisk,
courteous, kindly affectionate  a good
old man, pathetic to look upon. Car-
lyles acquaintances did not always grow
in his favor, and six years later he said
of Rogers: I do not remember any</PB>

old man (he is now eighty-three) whose
manner of living gave me less satisfac-
tion. In this winter of 184041, his
dissatisfaction with things in general
made him think at times of so desperate
a move as retreating again to Craigenput-
tock. Still he kept on with the reading
of needful books. He has had it
in his head for a good while, said Mrs.
Carlyle to a correspondent, on the 8th
of January, 1841, to write a life
of Cromwell, and has been sitting for
months back in a mess of great dingy
folios, the very look of which is like to
give me locked-jaw.
	Mrs. Hannings second child, Mary,
was born December 24, 1840.

xiv.	cARLYLE TO MRS. IJANNING, KIRTLE-
BRIDGE.

CHELSEA, 15th January, 1841.

	DEAR JENNY,  We have heard very
frequently from Alick of late about you,
for which punctuality we are greatly
obliged to him. You have had a bad
turn, poor little Jenny, and we were all
anxious enough to hear from day to day,
as you may believe, how it went with
you. Alick reports of late, yesterday in
particular, that you are now considered
out of danger, steadily getting better.
We will hope and believe it so, till we
hear otherwise. You must take good
care of yourself. This weather is good
for no creature, and must be worst of all
for one in your situation. Do not ven-
ture from the fire at all, till the horrible
slush of snow be off the ground.
	And what becomes of our good Mother
all this time? She could not be at rest
of course if she were not beside you,
watching over you herself. Alick strug-
gles to report favourably of her, but we
have our own apprehensions. What can
I do but again and again urge her to
take all possible precautions about her-
self (which however she will not do!)
and trust that she may escape without
serious mischief. If you were once up
again I will fancy you taking care of
her. It must be a great comfort to have
you so near her  within walking dis-
tance in the good season.
	We have never had here so ugly a
winter: first violent frost, snow &#38; c., then
still nastier times of the thawing sort:
for a week past there has been nothing
but sleet, rime and slobber, the streets
half an inch deep with slush and yet a
cake of slippery ice lying below that; so
in spite of daily and hourly sweeping
and scraping, they constantly continue.
I, with some few others, go daily out,
whatever wind blow. I am covered to
the throat in warm wool of various tex-
tures and can get into heat in spite of
fate. Jane too holds out wonderfully,
ventures forth when there is a bright
blink once in a week; sits quiet as a
mouse when the winds are piping abroad.
We understand you are far deeper in
snow than we. I believe there is now a
good thick quilt of it lying over the en-
tire surface of the Island.
	The Doctor was here till Tuesday
morning. We saw him daily with much
speech and satisfaction. A letter yes-
terday announced that they were fairly
settled in Wight again. He looked as
well as need be.
	I have sent by Alick a bit half-sovereign
to buy the poor new bairn a new pock.
You must take it without grumbling.
Tell my dear Mother that she must take
care of herself, that I will write to her
before many days go. Better health to
us all. Our kind wishes to Robert.
Good be with you every one.
Your affectionate brother,
T.	CARLYLE.


Here is another and a more highly
elaborated bit of London weather from
an undated fragment in Mrs. Hannings
possession at the time of her death: 
Our weather is grown decidedly
good for the last three days; very brisk,
clear and dry. Before that it was as
bad as weather at any time need be:
long continued plunges of wet, then</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00457" SEQ="0457" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="451">	Unpublished Letters of Garlyle.	451
clammy, glarry days on days of half
wet (a kind of weather peculiar to Lon-
don, and fully uglier than whole wet)
 a world of black sunless pluister, very
unpleasant to move about in! The in-
cessant travel makes everything mud
here, in spite of all that clats and besoms
can do; a kind of mud, too, which is as
fine as paint, and actually almost sticks
like a kind of paint! I took, at last,
into the country, with old clothes and
trousers folded up; there the mud was
natural mud, and far less of it, indeed,
little of it in comparison with other
country. We dry again in a single day
of brisk wind.
	Early in 1841 Carlyle arranged with
Fraser for the publication of Heroes
and Hero - Worship. The Miscella-
nies, Sartor, and the other books, says
Froude, were selling well, and fresh
editions were wanted.

xv.	CARLYLE TO HIS MOTHER, SCOTSBEIG.

CHELSEA, Saturday [February, 1841].

	M~ DEAR soon MOTHER,  Take half
a word from me to-day since I have no
time for more. I had forgotten that it
was Saturday till after breakfast I learnt
it, and ever since there has been business
on business!
	We received your good little letter
one evening and sent it on to John.
Thanks to you for it. I had a letter too
from Grahame about his Miscellanies,
for which he seems amazingly thankful,
poor fellow. We will not tell him about
the Ecclefechan Library  let well be!
	John also sends word of himself 
all right enough, the probability that
he will be here again before long.
	Jane and I are well, rejoicing in the
improved weather, not the best of wea-
ther yet, but immensely better than it
was. Some days have been sunny and
bright, a pleasant prophecy of spring.
	I have bargained with Fraser for my
lectures. They are now at press, that
kept me so very busy. He would give
me only 75, the dog, but then he un
dertakes a new edition of Sartor, too,
(the former being sold) and gives me
another 75 for that too. It is not so
bad, 150 of ready money  at least
money without risk. I did not calcu-
late on getting anything at present for
Teufelsdroeckh. You see we are rather
rising than falling, mall in shaft, at
any rate. That is always a great point.
Poor Teufelsdroeckh, it seems very cu-
rious money should lie even in him.
They trampled him into the gutters at
his first appearance, but he rises up
again,  finds money bid for him.
	On the whole I expect not to be
obliged to lecture this year, which will
be an immense relief to me: I shall not
be broken in pieces, I shall have strength
for perhaps some better things than
lecturing.
	You spoke of going to Dumfries: I
am always afraid of your getting hurt
on those expeditions, but I suppose you
will not be able to rest without going. I
wish Jean and you both were through it.
	By the bye, did I ever sufficiently tell
Isabella that her butter continues excel-
lent, none better. I owe Jamie a letter
too. Alick ought to have been apprised
how good his bacon was  was, for
alas, I myself eat the most part of it
and it is done: some weeks ago his to-
bacco ran out; I never told this either
 I forgot everything!
	Well, dear Mother, this is all I can
say in my hurry. I will write again soon,
but with two Books at the printers with
&#38; c., &#38; c., what can a poor man do? Be
good bairns, one and all of you.
Your ever affectionate
T.	CARLYLE.


	When the proofs of Hero -Worship
were finished, visits to Richard Mouck-
ton Milnes (afterward Lord Houghton),
and to the James Marshalls at Head-
ingly, gave Carlyle what seem to have
been his first glimpses of life in great
country houses. On the 17th of April,
1841, he communicated his impressions</PB>

to his wife: I never lived before in
such an element of much ado about
almost Nothing; life occupied altogeth-
er in getting itself lived; . . . and such
champagning, claretting, and witty con-
versationing. Ach Gott! I would sooner
be a ditcher than spend all my days so.
However, we got rather tolerably through
it for these ten days. Visits to his mo-
ther, Miss Martinean, the Speddings,
and a month in lodgings at Newby 
where he probably did not think of Red-
gauntlet  disposed of most of the re-
maining holiday, and brought Carlyle
back to Cheyne Row in September. The
book would not yet begin itself. Ought
I to write now of Oliver Cromwell?
Gott weiss; I cannot yet see clearly.
Toward the close of this year, Carlyle
was asked to let himself be nominated
to the new History Chair in Edinburgh
University. He declined, with noble
thanks.
	Our brother, whom Carlyle writes
of to Mrs. Hanning, was their half-bro-
ther, already referred to, who had emi-
grated to Canada in 1837, and died there
in 1872.

XVI.	CARLYLE TO MRS. RANKING, DUMFEJES.

CHELSEA, 24 Novr, 1841.
	DEAR JENNY,  Here is the Amen-
can letter you spoke of. It arrived yes-
terday, and to-day, after showing it to
John, I send it to you. I do not ex-
actly know what part of Canada it is
dated from, but the place lies some hun-
dreds of miles north-west of where your
husband is likely to be. Our brother
seems to be going on in a very prosper-
ous way there.
	On Sunday last the Doctor showed
me a letter he had written for you. It
appeared to be full of rational advice,
in all of which I agree. You must pluck
up a spirit, my good little Jenny, and
see clearly how many things you your-
self, independent of all other persons,
can still do. You, then, can either act
like a wise, courageous person or like a
fool, between which two ways of it there
lies still all the difference in the world
for you. . . . I assert, and believe al-
ways, that no person whatever can be
ruined except by his own consent, by his
own act, in this world. Your little
bairn will get to walk, then you will
have more time to sit to some kind of
employment. This will be your first
consolation.
	I know not whether our Mother is
still with you, but suppose yes. I wrote
to her a very hurried scrawl last week.
Pray take good care of her from the
damp and cold. I will write to her
again before long. By Alicks letter
of yesterday I learn that the Doctors
Book for her is safely come to Ecclefe-
chan. You can tell her farther that I
have now settled finally about her Luther
and it is hers. The cost was only some
26 shillings instead of 28.
	Jane has again over-hauled the drawers
which you had such work with; the best
plan was found to be to clip the leg off
altogether and put in four new inches
above the knee! Good be with you, dear
Jenny, with you, and them all.

	It is evident from one letter and an-
other that, after the removal to Dum-
fries and Mr. Hannings departure for
Canada, Mrs. Hanning Spent more time
at the Gill than in Dumfries. Poor
Helen was Helen Mitchell from Kirk-
caldy, an entertaining as well as a faith-
ful servant. She came to Cheyne Row
toward the end of 1837, was reclaimed
from drink by Mrs. Carlyle, but fell
hopelessly into it again after eleven years
of service. Her end was sad, and like
a thing of fate.

XVII.	cARLYLE To HIS MOTHER, ScoTSBHIG.
CHELSEA, 8th January, 1842.

	M~ DEAR MOTHER,  You have been
wandering so about of late times, and
there has been such confused trouble
going on, that I have not got you regu-
larly written to. It seems to me a long</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00459" SEQ="0459" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="453">	Unpublished Letters of Carlyle.	453
while since we had any right communi-
cation together. To-day I will scribble
you a word before going out. Aliek
says you are for moving over to Gill
again to bear Jenny company till the
day lengthens. If you be already gone
they will send this after you.
	The great trouble there has been at
Scotsbrig must have been distressing to
every person there, from the poor father
and mother downwards. You, in partic-
ular, could not escape. The weather also
is sorely inclement and not wholesome
for those that cannot take violent exer-
cise; yet Alick assures me you are as
well as usual. Nay, he adds that you
mean soon to write to me. I pray you
take care, dear Mother, in your shifting
to the Gill and during your stay there in
the stranger house; it is bitter weather
and looks as if it would continue long
frosty. Tell me especially how you are,
what clothes you wear, whether you get
good fires. A warm bottle is indispensa-
ble in the bed at night. You have books
to read, daily little bits of work to do;
you must crouch quiet till the sun comes
out again.
	A considerable noise has been going
on about that little Review-Article of
mine which I sent you. The last page
of the Divine Right of Squires has been
circulating widely through the News-
papers with various commentary and so
forth. This I by no means grudge: as
the thing is true, it may circulate as
widely as it likes. It can do nothing
but good (whether pleasant or painful
good) being true,  let it circulate where
it will. If a word of mine can help to
relieve the world from an insupportable
oppression, surely it shall be very wel-
come to do so! The man has paid me
for this article QL~24) but I think I
shall not soon trouble the world again
with reviewing. I mean something else
than that if I could get at it. On the
whole, what with Edinburgh Professor-
ships, what with Covenanter Articles,
we have had rather a noisy time of it in
the newspapers for a while back. It is
not unpleasant, but except for aiding the
sale of ones books, perhaps it is apt to
be unprofitable. Fame? Reputation?
	as old Tom White said of the
whiskey, Keep your whiskey to your-
sel! deevil o ever I se better than
when there s no a drop ont i my
wame? which is a literal truth, 
both as to fame and whiskey.
	My new book, I may tell you now, is
to be something about that same Civil
war in England which Baillie was in
the midst of; I think mainly or almost
exclusively about Oliver Cromwell. I
am struggling sore to get some hold of
it, but the business will be dreadfully
difficult, far worse than any French
Revolution, if I am to do it right: 
and if I do not do it right what is the
use of doing it at all? For some time I
tried actual writing at it lately, but found
it was too soon yet. I must wrestle and
tumble about with it, indeed at bottom I
do not know yet whether ever I shall be
able to make a Book out of it! All that
I can do is to try, till I ascertain either
Yes or No. For the rest I am grown
too old and cunning now to plunge right
on and attempt conquering the thing by
sheer force. I lie back, canny, canny,
and whenever I find my sleep beginning
to suffer, I lay down the tools for a
while. By Heavens great blessing I
am not now urged on by direct need of
money. We have arranged ourselves
here in what to London people is an
inconceivable state of thrift, and in our
small way are not now tormented with
any fear of want whatever, for the pre-
sent. To myself my poverty is really
quite a suitable, almost comfortable, ar-
rangement. I often think what should
I do if I were wealthy! I am perhaps
among the freest men in the British Em-
pire at this moment. No King or Pon-
tiff has any power over me, gets any re-
venne from me, except what he may de-
serve at my hands. There is nothing
but my Maker whom I call Master Un-</PB>

der this sky. What would I be at?
George Fox was hardly freer in his suit
of leather than I here: if to be sure not
carrying it quite so far as the leather.
Jane, too, is quite of my way of think-
ing in this respect. Truly we have been
mercifully dealt with, and much that
looked like evil has turned to be good.
One thing I must tell you as a small ad-
venture which befell, the day before yes-
terday. On going out for walking along
one of these streets an elderly, innocent,
intelligent - looking gentleman accosted
me with Apologies for introducing him-
self to Mr. Carlyle whose works &#38; c, &#38; c.
He was the Parish clergyman, rector
of the Parish of St. Lukes, Chelsea! I
replied of course with all civility to the
worthy man (though shocked to admit
that after seven years of parishionership
I did not know the face of him). We
walked together as far as our roads
would coincide, then parted with low
bows. I mean to ask about the man
(whose name I do not even know yet!)
and, if the accounts be good, to invite a
nearer approximation.
	Jack will be with us to-morrow even-
ing, we expect; oftenest we see him only
that once in the course of a week. He
is healthy, cheery and as full of talk and
activity as I ever saw him. His Patient
and he walk daily, or drive, or ride sev-
eral hours, which is a good encourager
of health. He seems likelier than ever
to stay a good while in this present sit-
uation, to realize a good purse perhaps,
 and then retire as a half-pay. Jane
sticks close in the house ever since the
frost began, for near a week now; she
is in very tolerable health. Poor Helen,
our servant, heard the other night of the
death of a poor sick (asthmatic) sister
at Edinburgh, which grieved her to the
ground for a while and still greatly
afflicts her; we are sorry for the poor
creature.
	Alicks long letter, you can tell him,
shall be answered by and by. I had
also a letter from Jean not many days
ago. I have extremely little time for
writing letters. You must all be patient
with me. Commend me to poor Isabella,
whose affliction we deeply sympathize
with.
Yours affectionately.

	On February 26th Mrs. Welsh died at
Templand, in Nithsdale, where she had
lived since her daughters marriage. Car-
lyle had now to pass two months and
more at Templand in the settlement of
affairs. By the death of her mother
Mrs. Carlyle regained possession of
Craigenputtock, the rent of which, 200
a year, she had settled on Mrs. Welsh.
Thus, from this date onward, notes
Carlyle in the Reminiscences, we were
a little richer, easier in circumstances;
and the pinch of Poverty, which had
been relaxing latterly, changed itself
into a gentle pressure, or into a limit
and little more. We did not change our
habits in any point, but the grim collar
round my neck was sensibly slackened.
Slackened, not removed at all,  for al-
most twenty years yet. - . . I do not
think my literary income was above 200
a year in those decades,  in spite of my
continual diligence day by day.
	The cheery little cousin was Miss
Jeannie Welsh, daughter to John Welsh
of Liverpool, before mentioned, and
mentioned again in the last paragraph
of the following letter.

xviii.	CARLYLE TO HI5 MOTHER, scOTsBiuG.
CHELSEA, Friday, 4th June, 1842.

	M~ DEAR MOTHER,  A letter from
Jenny came in the beginning of the
week; then last night another from her
for Jack, which seemed to have been
written at the same time, which also I
opened as it passed,  forwarding them
both thereupon to Jack. Jacks address
is 3 Chester Terrace, Regents Park. Tell
Jenny to copy this, and then she will
know it henceforth. You must also thank
her very kindly for the word she sends
me about you and about the rest. I find</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00461" SEQ="0461" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="455">	Unpublished Letters of Carlyle.	455

your eyes are still sore, and I doubt this
hot weather will do them no good. Per-
haps keeping out of the light as much as
possible might be useful. I would also
recommend to abstain from~ rubbing as
much as you can. If Jack know any
likely eye water, I will make him send
a receipt for it. This is a very trouble-
some kind of thing  but surely we
ought to be thankful that it is not a
worse thing too
	Jack was away in the country last
week, but is come home again. He was
down here on Wednesday night to tea,
as fresh and hearty as ever. They are
to be in London mainly, I believe, all
summer. He will contrive plenty of
jaunts &#38; c., I suppose. It is, as for-
merly, an idle trade, but a very well paid
one. It was precisely on that Wednes-
day that the Queen had been shot at.
These are bad times for Kings and
Queens. This young blackguard, it seems,
is not mad at all; was in great want,
and so forth; it is said they will hang
him. Such facts indicate that evenamong
the lowest classes of the people, Queen-
ship and Kingship are fast growing out
of date.
	My poor wife is still very disconso-
late, silent, pale, broken-down, and very
weak. I urge her out as much as pos-
sible; her cheery little cousin, too, does
what she can. Alas, it is a very sore
affliction; we have but one mother to
lose. I speak to her seriously sometimes,
but speaking cannot heal grief; only
Time and Heavens mercy can.
	As for me, I sleep tolerably well, and
also have now begun to work a little,
which is still better! I shall have a ter-
rible heap of reading, of meditating, sort-
ing, struggling of every kind. But why
should I not do it, if it be a good work?
I feel as if there did lie something in it.
I will grudge no toil to bring it out. I
go often all day to the Museum Library
and search innumerable old pamphlets,
&#38; c. It is a nasty place, five miles off,
and full of heat and bad air, but it con-
tains great quantities of information. I
refuse all dinners whatsoever, or very
nearly all. I say, Well, if you do take
offence at me, how can I help it? In the
whole world there is only one true bless-
ing for me,  that of working an honest
work. If you would give me the Bank
of England, and all set to worship me
with bended knees,  alas, that would
do nothing for me at all. It is not you
that can help me or hinder me; it is I,
even I. Pray that I persist in this good
course.
	Poor Isabella does not seem to profit
by the warm weather. I would recom-
mend the shower bath to her. I take
it daily here. Tell Jenny that there is
no hurry about the shirts. She can go
on with all leisure. Did Jamie ever
learn from me that in the drawer of their
washstand, if he will pull it out, there
lies for him a little piece of new stuff
for rubbing on his razor strop? I always
forgot to mention it. Our weather here
is excellent, threatening to be too hot
by and by, which, however, I shall not
grudge so much this year. Broiling
weather to me will be the basis of a plen-
teous year for all. There is much need
of it!
	But I must end, dear Mother. I
write hardly any letters except to you,
so you will accept this as the best I can
do at present. The subscription for
Burnss sister is doing well, in Liverpool
at least (under John Welsh). My af-
fection to Alick and all of them. You
will get this when you go to the Preach-
ing.
	My blessings on you, dear Mother, and
all love.
Your son,
TOM.
XIX.	cARLYLE TO RIS MOTHER, scOTsBRIG.

CHELSEA, Monday Morning,
4th July, 1842.
	M~ DEAR MOTHER,  Before setting
to my work, let me expend a penny and
a scrap of paper on you, merely to say

that we are well, and to send a bit of</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00462" SEQ="0462" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="456">	456	Unpublished Letters of Carlyle.

ugly and curious public news that you
cannot yet have heard of. On Saturday
night it was publicly made known that
Francis, the man who last shot at the
Queen, was not to be hanged, but to be
sent to Botany Bay, or some such pun-
ishment. Well, yesterday about noon,
as the Queen went to St. James Chapel,
a third individual presented his pistol at
the Majesty of England, but was struck
down and seized before he could fire it;
he and another who seemed to be in con-
cert with him are both laid up. There
is no doubt of the fact. The two are
both young men; we have yet heard
nothing more of them than that. The
person who struck down the pistol (and
with it the man, so vehement was he)
is said to be a gentlemans flunkey; but
I do not know that for certain and have
seen no newspaper yet. . . . Are not
these strange times? The people are
sick of their misgovernment, and the
blackguards among them shoot at the
poor Queen: as a man that wanted the
steeple pulled down might at least fling
a stone at the gilt weathercock. The
poor little Queen has a horrid business of
it,  cannot take a drive in HER clatch
without risk of being shot! Our clatch
is much safer. All men are becoming
alarmed at the state of the country, 
as I think they well may.
	Jane and her cousin have this morn-
ing been got off to Windsor by the Ster-
lings. The jaunt in the open air will do
the poor Wifie good.
	John is very well. I parted with him
last night near his own house rather af-
ter 10 oclock.
	Adieu, dear Mother. Here is a fool-
ish Yankee letter of adoration to me.
Burn it!
Your affectionate,
T.	CARLYLE.


	The picture of Sartor measuring him-
self for shirts to be made at long range,
as it were, is memorable even in the an-
nals of Cheyne Row.
XX.	cAELvLE TO MRS. HANNING, THE GILL.
CHELSEA, 21 July, 1842.

	M~ DEAR JENNY,  I am glad to hear
of your well being, and that you have
got done with the shirts, which is a sign
of your industry. They will be well off
your hands, and I have no doubt will be
found very suitable when they arrive
here. In the meanwhile I do not want
them sent off yet till there are some
more things to go with them. I am in
no want of them yet, and shall not, I
think, be so till it will be about time for
the meal to be sent from Scotsbrig. At
all events, you may look to that (for the
present) as the way of sending them,
and therefore keep them beside you till
some chance of delivering them safe to
my Mother or another Scotsbrig party
turn up. There is no haste about them;
the meal cannot be ready, I suppose, till
the end of September, if then.
	In the meanwhile I want you to make
me some flannel things, too,  three flan-
nel shirts especially: you can get the
flannel from Alick, if he have any that
he can well recommend. You can read-
ily have them made before the other
shirts go off: I have taken the measure
to-day, and now send you the dimensions,
together with a measuring strap which I
bought some weeks ago (at one penny)
for the purpose! You are to be careful to
scour the flannel first, after which pro-
cess the dimensions are these. Width
(when the shirt is laid on its back) 22A
inches, extent from wrist button to wrist
button 61 inches,1 length in the back
35 inches, length in the front 25~ inches.
Do you understand all that? I dare
say you will make it out, and this mea-
suring band will enable you to be ex-
act enough. Only you must observe
that at the beginning of it. . . . Hoity-
Toity! I find that it is I myself that
have made a mistake there, and that you
have only to measure fair with the line
and all will be right; the dimensions as
above, 22k, 61, 35, 25k.
So that each sleeve is 19~ inches long.</PB>

	If you could make me two pairs of
flannel drawers, I should like very well
too, but that I am afraid will be too hard
for you. This is all the express work I
have for you at present. Neither is
there any news of much moment that
I could send you. Jane continues still
weak, but seems to gather strength, too.
I keep very quiet and very busy, and
stand the summer fully better than is usu-
al with me here. John still continues in
town, and does not speak of going yet.
We meet every Sunday here at Dinner.
	Our good Mother, you perhaps know,
has got over to Jean for some sea bath-
ing about Arbigland. We hope they
are all well about Gill, and that a good
crop is on its feet for them. Give our
kind regards and continual good wishes
both to Mary and Jamie, and accept
them for yourself. Next time you write
you had better tell me how your money
stands out; and if at any time, my dear
little Sister, I can help you in anything,
be sure do not neglect to write then. Our
love and best wishes to you, dear Jenny.
Your affectionate brother,
T.	CARLYLE.


	In May, on his way back from Temp-
land, Carlyle had stopped to visit Dr.
Arnold at Rugby, arid in August he
went to Belgium with Mr. Stephen
Spring Rice and his younger brother.
Of this trip Carlyle wrote an extraordi-
narily vivid account under the title of
The Shortest Tour on Record. The pic-
ture of the poor lace-maker and her
habitation. at Ghent, makes one think,
by a queer, austere contrary, of an earli-
er traveler and his adventures.
	In August, also, Mrs. Carlyle had
gone to the Bullers, in Suffolk. Twenty
capital pages of Letters and Memorials
make her visit live again.

XXI.	cARLYLE TO HIS MOTHER, scoTsBRIG.
CAMBRIDGE, 7th Sep., 1842.
	DEAR MOTHER,  I am sitting
here in the Hoop Inn of Cambridge,
in a spacious apartment, blazing with
gaslight and nearly solitary. It strikes
me I may as well employ the hour be-
fore bedtime in writing a word for my
good Mother,  to explain to her how
I am, and above all what in the world I
am doing here! There is a magnificent
thunderstorm just going on, or rather be-
ginning to pass off in copious floods of
rain, and there is no other sound audi-
ble in this room; one single fellow-travel-
ler lies reading the Times Newspaper on
the sofa opposite, and the rain quenches
even the sound of his breath.
	Well, dear Mother, you heard that
Jane was gone into Suffolk to Mrs. Bul-
lers, and perhaps you understand or
guess that she continues still there; nay,
perhaps Jack may have informed you
that on Thursday last (a week ago all
but a day) I, after long higgling, set out
to bring her home. Home, however,
she was not to go quite so fast. Mrs.
Buller, rather lively up in that region,
wanted her to stay a little longer, want-
ed me also, I suppose, to go flaunting
about, calling on Lady this and Sir
Henry that, and lionizing and amusing
myself as I best might in her neighbour-
hood. She is very kind indeed,  more
hospitable and good than I have almost
ever seen her to anybody. The place
Norton is a quiet, sleek, green place, so
intersected with green, wide lanes (loan-
ings) all overgrown with trees that you
can hardly find your way in it,  like
walking in some coal-mine in paths un-
derground; it or any green country
whatever, as you know, is likely to be
welcome to me. One day I walked off
to a place called Thetford in Norfolk,
about 8 miles from us. It was the mor-
row after my arrival, and I did not know
the nature of the lanes then. I lost my
way both going and coming, and made
the distance 12 or 13 each way, but got
home in time to dinner, and was all the
better for my walk. Afterwards I never
ventured out of sight of Norton Church-
tower without first drawin~ for myself</PB>

a little map of my route from a big
map that hangs in the lobby. With my
little map in my waistcoat pocket I
feared nothing, and indeed in three days
knew all the outs and ins of the country;
 for Mrs. Buller in that interval had
contrived to borrow me a farmers horse
to go about on. Was not that a friendly
office to a man like me?
	But to hasten to the point! Mrs.
Bullers, I knew beforehand, was but
some 30 miles to the east of Cromwells
country; his birthplace, the farm he had
first, and the farm he had second, all lie
adjoining on the Westward, either in the
next County, which is this (Cambridge-
shire), or in Huntingdonshire, the one
Westward of this. Accordingly, having
talked a long enough time about jaunts
and pilgrimages,  about it and about it,
 I decided at last (the women threat-
ening to laugh at me if I did not go)
on actually setting off, and accordingly
here I am, with my face already home-
wards, the main part of my little errand
successfully accomplished; and a  riding
tour through the country parts of Eng-
land, which I have been talking of these
dozen years or more, has actually taken
effect on the small scale,  a very small
scale indeed. I have ridden but two
days, and on the morrow evening I shall
be at Norton again, or near it. My con-
veyance heing the farmers horse above
mentioned, my fatigue has been great;
 for it is the roughest and dourest
beast nearly that I ever rode, and to-day
in the morning, to mend matters, it took
to the trick they call  scouring,  in a
sullen, windless ninny niawing.  Many
a time I thought of Alick and Jamie in
these Cambridge Fens, and wished one
or both of them had been near me. But
I let the creature take time (for it would
have it), and it gradually recruited again,
though not brilliant at the best; and in-
deed I shall be very willing to wish it
good-bye tomorrow evening, were I at
Norton again. Poor brute, it cannot
help being supple and riding as with
stilky-clogs at its feet! It has eaten
four and a half feeds of corn to-day, or
I think it would altogether have failed.
	But at any rate I have seem the Crom-
well country, got an image of it in my
mind for all time henceforth. I was
last night at Ely, the Bishops City of
this district. I walked in and about the
Cathedral for two good hours. Thought
vividly of Cromwell stepping up these
floors, with his sword by his side, bid-
ding the Priest (who would not obey his
first order, but continued reading his
liturgies), Cease your fooling and come
out, Sir.  One can fancy with what
a gollie in the voice of him. I found
the very house he had lived in. I sat
and smoked a pipe about nine oclock
under the stars on the very Horse-
block (harping-on stone) which Oliver
had often mounted from, two hundred
years ago. It was all full of inter-
est, and though I could get but very
little sleep at night, I did not grudge
that price. To.day I rode still farther
Westward to a place called St. Ives,
where Oliver first took to farming. The
house they showed as his I did not be-
lieve in, hut the fields that he tilled and
reaped are veritably there. I sat down
under the shade of one of his hedges
and kindled a cigar, not without reflec-
tions! I have also seen his native town
Huntingdon, with many other things to-
day, and am here now on my way home-
ward, as I said, and will not trouble my
dear good Mother with one other word
of babblement on the subject at present.
No country in itself can well be uglier;
it is all a drained immensity of fen (or
soft peat moss), and bears a considerable
resemblance to the trench at Dumfries, 
if that were some 30 or 40 miles square,
with Parish churches innumerable, all
built on dry knolls of chalky earth that
rise up like islands. You can tell Jamie
that it bears heavy crops! oats, beans,
wheat, which they are just concluding the
leading in of at present; the rest of the
country being done a week or two ago.</PB>

	Dear Mother, was there ever such a
clatter of a letter written? And not one
word of news, not one word even of the
many hundred I could use in inquiring!
We return to Chelsea, I expect, about
Monday first. Saturday was to be pro-
posed, but will not stand I believe. Jack
is already gone, on Saturday last, to
Cheltenham, and then for North Wales.
Right glad am I for him and for you
that he is to come into Annandale for a
little while. Poor fellow, it is long since
he has been there, and he too has his
own feelings and straits which he does
not speak about often. My dear Mo-
ther, I will bid you all good-night. I
send you my hearts best blessing oer
all the hills and rivers that lie between
us to-night. The thunder is gone, and
the rain. I will send you a little word
when we get to Chelsea; perhaps there
is something from yourself for me al-
ready forwarded to Norton. I doubt it.
Good-night, my dear true Mother.
Ever your affects
T.	CARLYLE.
	I know not whether Alick has now
any communication with the Whitehaven
Tobacconist? A quarter of a stone
might be ventured upon along with the
Harvest meal, or by the Doctor or some
other conveyance. It keeps in the win-
ter; it could not be worse than my Lon-
don tobacco all this year. Tell Alick
about it; he rejoices always to help me
whenever he can.

	Carlyles pilgrimage to Huntingdon,
St. Ives, and thereabouts is not to be
confounded with his former Cromwell
journey  to Naseby  undertaken a
few months before, with Dr. Arnold.
Froudes account of Carlyles investiga-
tion of the battlefield was (necessarily)
so incomplete that I venture to quote
here two highly interesting letters from
a long afterward published book,
Letters of Edward Fitzgerald. Says
Fitzgerald, in a memorandum on the
subject: 
	As I happened to know the Field
well,  the greater part of it then be-
longing to my Family,  I knew that
Carlyle and Arnold had been mistaken
 misled in part by an Obelisk which
my Father had set up as on the highest
Ground of the Field, but which they
mistook for the centre-ground of the
Battle. This I told Carlyle, who was
very reluctant to believe that he and
Arnold could have been deceived  that
he could accept no hearsay Tradition or
Theory against the Evidence of his own
Eyes, etc. However, as I was just then
going down to Naseby, I might enquire
further into the matter.
	On arriving at Naseby, I had spade
and mattock taken to a hill near half a
mile across from the Blockhead Obe-
lisk, and pitted with several hollows,
overgrown with rank Vegetation, which
Tradition had always pointed to as the
Graves of the Slain. One of these I
had opened; and there, sure enough,
were the remains of skeletons closely
packed together  chiefly teeth  but
some remains of Shin-bone, and marks
of Skull in the Clay. Some of these,
together with some sketches of the
Place, I sent to Carlyle.
Fitzgerald, in a letter which has ap-
parently not been preserved, sent the re-
sults of this first investigation to Carlyle.
He wrote also from Naseby the following
letter to Bernard Barton : 
[NASEBY], Septr. 22, /42.

	M~ DEAR BARTON,. The pictures
are left all ready packed up in Portland
Place, and shall come down with me,
whenever that desirable event takes
place. In the meanwhile here I am as
before; but having received a long and
interesting letter from Carlyle asking
information about this Battle field, I
have trotted about rather more to ascer-
tain names of places, positions, etc.
After all, he will make a mad book. I
have just seen some of the bones of a
dragoon and his horse who were found</PB>

foundered in a morass in the field 
poor dragoon, much dismembered by
time: his less worthy members, having
been left in the owners summer-house
for the last twenty years, have disap-
peared one by one, but his skull is kept
safe in the hall: not a bad skull neither;
and in it some teeth yet holding, and a bit
of the iron heel of his boot, put into the
skull by way of convenience. This is
what Sir Thomas Browne calls mak-
ing a man act his Antipodes. 1 J have
got a fellow to dig at one of the great
general graves in the field; and he tells
me to-night that he has come to bones;
to-morrow I will select a neat specimen
or two. In the meantime let the full
harvest moon wonder at them as they
lie turned up after lying hid 2400 revo-
lutions of hers. Think of that warm
14th of June when the Battle was fought,
and they fell pell-mell: and then the
country people came and buried them
so shallow that the stench was terrible,
and the putrid matter oozed over the
ground for several yards; so that the
cattle were observed to eat those places
very close for some years after. Every
one to his taste, as one might well say
to any woman who kissed the cow that
pastured there.
	Friday, 23rd. We have dug at a
place, as I said, and made such a trench
as would hold a dozen fellows, whose
remains positively make up the mould.
The bones nearly all rotted away, ex-
cept the teeth, which are quite good.
At the bottom lay the form of a perfect
skeleton: most of the bones gone, but
the pressure distinct in the clay; the
thigh and leg bones yet extant; the
skull a little pushed forward, as if there
were scanty room. We also tried some
other reputed graves, but found nothing;
indeed, it is not easy to distinguish
what are graves from old marlpits, etc.
I dont care for all this bone-rummaging
	1 Referring to a passage in the Garden of
Cyrus, near the end: To keep our eyes open
longer, were but to act our antipodes. The
myself; but the identification of the
graves identifies also where the greatest
heat of the battle was. Do you wish
for a tooth?
	As I began this antiquarian account
in a letter to you, so I have finished it,
that you may mention it to my Papa,
who perhaps will be amused at it. Two
farmers insisted on going out exploring
with me all day: one a very solid fel-
low, who talks like the justices in Shake-
speare, but who certainly was inspired
in finding out this grave; the other a
Scotchman, full of intelligence, who pro-
posed the flesh-soil for manure for tur-
nips. The old Vicar, whose age reaches
halfway back to the day of the Bat-
tle, stood tottering over the verge of the
trench. Carlyle has shewn great saga-
city in guessing at the localities from the
vague descriptions of contemporaries;
and his short pastiecio of the battle is
the best I have seen. But he will spoil
all by making a demigod of Cromwell,
who certainly was so far from wise that
he brought about the very thing he
fought to prevent,  the restoration of
an unrestricted monarchy.

	The substance of this letter was of
course communicated by Fitzgerald to
Carlyle, who promptly and gratefully
replied.

	CHELSEA, Saturday, 25 [241 Septr. 1842.

	M~ DEAR SIR,  You will do me and
the Genius of History a real favour, if
you persist in these examinations and
excavations to the utmost length pos-
sible for you! It is long since I read a
letter so interesting as yours of yester-
day. Clearly enough you are upon the
very battle-ground ;  and I, it is also
clear, have only looked up towards it
from the slope of Mill Hill. Were not
the weather so wet, were not, etc., etc.,
so many etceteras, I could almost think

huntsmen are up in America, and they are
already past their first sleep in Persia.</PB>

of running up to join you still! But
that is evidently unfeasible at present.
	The opening of that burial-heap blazes
strangely in my thoughts: these are the
very jawbones that were clenched to-
gether in deadly rage, on this very
ground, 197 years ago! It brings the
matter home to one, with a strange vera-
city,  as if for the first time one saw it
to be no fable and theory, but a dire fact.
I will beg for a tooth and a bullet; au-
thenticated by your own eyes and word
of honour! Our Scotch friend, too, mak-
ing turnip manure of it,  he is part
of the Picture. I understand almost all
the Netherlands battlefields have already
given up their bones to British hus-
bandry; why not the old English next?
Honour to thrift. If of 5000 wasted
men you can make a few usable turnips,
why, do it!
	The more sketches and details you
can contrive to send me, the better. I
want to know, for one thing, whether
there is any house on Cloisterwell; what
house that was that I saw from the slope
of Naseby height (Mill-hill, I suppose),
and fancied to be Dust Hill Farm? It
must lie about North by West from
Naseby Church, perhaps near a mile off.
You say, one cannot see Dust Hill at
all, much less any farm house of Dust
Hill, from that Naseby Height?
	But why does the Obelisk stand there?
It might as well stand at Charing Cross;
the blockhead that it is! I again wish
I had wings; alas, I wish many things;
that the gods would but annihilate Time
and Space, which would include all
things!
	In great haste, Yours most truly,
T.	CARLYLE.


	Both Carlyles letter to Fitzgerald and

hunger of the eye which went far to

BOTCHING SHAKESPEARE.

flanlet, IV. v. 9, 10.

	THE ascendency which much of our
English literature holds over us is too
largely one of opinion. There is a cer-
tain range of the great books of it which
we take on faith; if we do come to read
them for ourselves, our enjoyment of
them is derived too often from a con-
sciousness that enjoyment is the right
thing to feel under the circumstances.
But our reading is perfunctory, task-

too, when we cease even to make these

never see with other eyes than those of
villagers.
	Early in life we learn to style Chau-
cer the Father of our English Poetry,
and, conscious of our birthright, duti-
fully set ourselves to work getting ac-
quainted with the Prologue and at least
one of the Canterbury Tales. These
we painfully read into monstrous Eng-
lish, sometimes catching a little of the
beauty of Chaucers rhythm where time
has not played havoc with it, and often
faintly discerning the play of Chaucers
humor through the veil of unfamiliar
phraseology. But we do not really read
Chaucer. We put that word in the vo-
cabulary along with this word in the
text, we fit that note in the back of the
book to this difficult passage in the
front, we ignore the sound of the lan-
guage, we twist its inflection to suit ~i
preconceived notion of its rhythm, and
the net result is a jargon that Chaucer
could not understand and a modern
would not use. Our sole dependence for
what little intelligence of Chaucers
meaning we get is upon a particular set
of notes and a special glossary. When
we come to read Chaucer later in life,
and all the words and notes are forgot-
ten, how tedious it all is ! Is it Aprile
or April-c? What does soote mean?
(We pronounce it to rhyme with boot,
but by calling the word at the end of the
next line root matters are set right again.)
How is a flower engendered of vir-
tue? And so on. It does not take
much of this sort of thing to tire out the
best of resolves. We can find enough to
justify all that has been said about Chau-
cer; but as to reading his poetry, we will
leave that to somebody who has more
time and energy for it than we have.
	We fare little better with Spenser,
though Spensers speech is nearer ours
than Chaucer~ s is. Two books of the
Faerie Queene are prescribed (one is al-
most tempted to say proscribed ) for
college reading in English literature;
how many of us have read more than
the academic stint of it? How many
of us have gone on and learned to know
the sonnets, the purity of their thought,
the sweetness of their mellifluous word-
ing? To how many persons is Spenser
more than a name?
	Yet if called upon to give an account
of our great poetry, we invariably start
the list, in a burst of enthusiasm, with
Chaucer and Spenser, although Chaucer
and Spenser actually play a less part in
the reading of most of us than Rudyard
Kipling does. And what is true of
Chaucer and Spenser is true of a deal of
our literature: we read about it, listen to
lectures about it, talk about it, without
having read it for ourselves; nay, some-
times lecture about it, like the professor
of English literature whose lectures con-
tained an account of a short dramatic
poem by Browning called Pippa Pass-6s.
Some of us do make a praiseworthy ef-
fort to keep up with our best literature,
and we flatter ourselves that our effort
is successful. But the very making the
effort smacks of the artificial, and the
success of it too often sows the seeds of
distinctions which soon grow up to choke
with self-conceit and priggishness the lit-
tle plants of culture we nurse so carefully.
	There is a certain cant about the criti-
cism of literature, too, growing out of this
artificial way of treating it, that exasper-
ates the more sensible of us. We re-
cognize certain recurring phrases in all
criticism, if we read much of it. We see
Shakespeare so often sitting, finger on
brow and pen in hand, gazing into the
abysses of human despair and evolving a
Hamlet as to grow tired of the picture.
When we are told that as a piece of
psychological development Hamlet lacks
the lucidity of classical art;  that the
heros soul has all the untranspicuous-
ness and complexity of a real soul ;
that one generation after another has
deposited in Hamlets soul the sum of
its experience, many of us cannot help
feeling that such criticism is pretty close
to nonsense. We recognize the cant</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00469" SEQ="0469" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="463">	Botching Shakespeare.	463

of a cultus,  a cultus that grows fur-
ther and further from the interests of
our every-day life. Again, a great deal
of criticism is far from being critical.
Its judgments, uttered with impressive
conviction, are too often the result of
mere personal opinion. No evidence is
given; frequently, indeed, in the very
nature of the case, none is obtainable.
We are asked to accept a self-constituted
authority. Having to do with practical
affairs, having to distrust emotional
opinion, having to ask searching ques-
tions of ourselves and others, it is hard
to lull ourselves into a condition where
we can take so much on trust. Rebel-
lion is not worth the time and trouble;
and we are not sure that rebellion would
be successful. Controversy in these
matters is so apt to become personal.
We therefore take the easiest way out,
and remove ourselves from the critics
jurisdiction.
	Thus, as we grow older, we cease to be
literary. The people who leave these
things more and more to others are not
Philistines, either, as Matthew Arnold
called them. You find them in Oxford
common-rooms as well as in American
homes. Nor has the age grown careless
of the things of culture. That is an
easy charge to make, but as groundless
as such charges usually are. If one will
only take the trouble to look for it, more
culture can be found in a Western inland
town nowadays than many of our large
cities could boast of when culture was
spelled with a capital C, and had Mat-
thew Arnold for its apostle.
	Why is it, then, that so many of us
who have had the advantages of univer-
sity training, who have passed, satisfac-
torily at least, various courses of liter-
ary instruction, who have been at times
enthusiastic members of reading clubs,
who can speak and write reasonably
good English, who have some knowledge
of life and affairs,  why is it that we
must read lamely and haltingly the su-
preme poets of our race? The answer
is simple, but one we shall be most of
us loath to admit: we have not the
necessary English education to read
English literature easily. Our training
has been Greek, not English. Logical-
ly, as far as literature goes, we are citi-
zens of Athens in the time of Pericles,
not Americans and Englishmen of to-
day. And it is not uncommon for us to
boast of the fact. As a people we pos-
sess only our contemporary literature;
we include Chaucer and Spenser by
courtesy, but we do not really possess
them; indeed, we do not even possess
Shakespeare in the full sense of posses-
sion, though we call him our Prince of
Poets.
	Let us put aside the question of Chau-
cer and Spenser, and examine tLe mat-
ter as it concerns Shakespeare. We do
not possess Shakespeare to the full, be-
cause we do not understand Shakespeare.
And I do not only mean that there are
isolated words or isolated lines in Shake-
speare which we do not understand, but
I would maintain that we do not read
Shakespeare understandingly.
	In the first place, let me explain what
I mean by understandingly. As we
go through life and continuously add to
our experience, we add at the same time
words which are native to our thinking
and fitting to our experience. Most of
these words are generic, and have their
place in other minds just as they have
in ours. They represent pretty much
the same objects of thought and pretty
much the same relations for all who
think in the language we use. Some of
them we use often, others are as rare as
the experiences they connote; but all are
there, ready to rise at the proper call. It is
the power of literature to call them forth
and set them in what order the poet (for
in this sense all literature is poetry) may
choose. He weaves them together, and
our lives are caught in the tissue whe-
ther we wish it or no. He uses words
that have been in our hearts at times
when feeling was strong and deep; words</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00470" SEQ="0470" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="464">	464	Botching Shakespeare.

which bitter memories cling to; words
which lovers use; words fast knit into
childish prayer; words of homely com-
fort when deaths hand was heavy; words
bound up with duty, hope, love, faith,
and the best things we have known or
hope to know. As they pass through
our minds they stir us again, revealing
us to ourselves as they reveal the poets
thought to us, and our hearts burn with-
in us. They are English words worn by
ages of English use,  the oldest, sim-
plest words of the language, and there-
fore the richest in association. They are
the words of Home, Sweet Home, Amer-
ica, God Save the Queen, Pilgrims Pro-
gress, the Bible (would that they were
there given their modern English form,
so that they might be more homely still !),
 our English birthright.
	Such words make our best literature,
and always will, as long as human hearts
beat in our breasts. We cannot escape
them: they are part of ourselves, the
ghosts of our good deeds and our bad
deeds that must abide with us; we can-
not get rid of them. For us they need
no notes, no interpretation; they go
straight to our understandings without
need of introduction; when the poet
uses them, they are intelligible, and im-
mediately intelligible, conveying without
risk of mistake exactly the thought of
the poets mind, and no other. The
process of apprehending them to the
full is what might be called, with a lit-
tle stretching of the term, reflex action.
This is what I mean by understanding,
and reading in this way is reading un-
derstandingly.
	Now there is another mental process
which we go through in reading that is
simply one of judgment. We do not
possess a word as part of our thinking
vocabulary, and must make an infer-
ence from the context, or from its simi-
larity to some word we do know, in or-
der to get at the idea probably embodied
in it. This has nothing to do with lit-
erature, and if there is very much of
this sort of thing in our reading, what
we read for us is not literature. We do
not understand it; we simply guess as to
the probable meaning.
	This process is entirely distinct from
the one of understanding, yet we are con-
stantly confusing the two; we make the
mistake of confounding the natural im-
plications which are or ought to be purely
mechanical, and which are due to the
fact that answering chords of our experi-
ence vibrate with the string the poet has
struck,  we confound these with the in-
ferences we are compelled to make on
account of our imperfect understanding
of language. That is, to apply this to
our Shakespeare reading, certain words
or arrangements of words in Shake-
speare are not really part of our think-
ing experience at all, and there is no-
thing in our minds to respond to them;
we recognize these blanks immediately,
and fill them in with words and phrases
which do provoke associations, and which
seem to be those the poet might have
used under the circumstances, had he
spoken the language we think with. We
generously set down the imperfection 
for we know it is an imperfection  to
the natural inequality of poetic genius
and the natural faultiness of a human ma-
chine, or we attribute it to the dullness
of our literary apperceptions. But the
fault lies neither with Shakespeare nor
with our dullness of apperception: it lies
simply and solely in our ignorance of
English.
	Now, if you will take down your
Shakespeare and read consecutively for
a few pages anywhere, without resort
to the usual helps and explanations,
and will try at the same time to throw
yourself out of a literary attitude
far enough to discern surely what you
understand immediately from what you
do not understand, but infer, you will
see that the mediate and secondary pro-
cesses are more numerous than you had
thought. Suppose the passage you turn
to is Hamlet, I. iii. 58, if., in the middle</PB>

of Poloniuss long-winded good-by to his
son. It runs : 
And these few precepts in thy memory
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no
tongue,
Nor any unproportiond thought his act. (60)
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption
tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel,
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatchd unfledged comrade.
Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
Bear t, that the opposed may beware of
thee.
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice:
Take each mans censure, but reserve thy
judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, (70)
But not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
And they in France of the best rank and
station
Are of a most select and generous chief in
that.

Recognizing the unfitness of the com-
monest sense of character (59) you think
of character in the sense of sign or
letter, and by this inference arrive
at the meaning of Shakespeares word.
Character, however, in Elizabethan
English (frequently accented  char-
as here), is a common synonym
of write. The imperative Leo/c fol-
lowed by the subjunctive is now strange
syntax, but its likeness to such an idiom
as  See you do it well makes it intel-
ligible. Proportioned (60) in the sense
of made symmetrical is still in liter-
ary use, though we usually put well
in front of it, and will probably give
you an inkling of Shakespeares mean-
ing. His act, however, can scarcely fail
to suggest a personification; even if you
remember enough of your Shakespeare
training to recognize the pronoun as the
genitive of it, the form is as unusual
to your thinking as its was to Shake-
speares; act, too, in the sense of ex-
ecution is as unfamiliar to you as
thought in the sense of intention is.
Poloniuss advice to his boy, to keep his
own counsel and mature his plans well,
	VOL. LXXXII.  No. 492.	30
thus becomes to your mind the liter-
ary equivalent of Dont be talkative
and dont act foolishly. Familiar and
vulgar (61) carry an ignominious sense
which the words did not have to the
ears of Shakespeares audience: Polonius
neither recommends familiarity to his
son nor warns him against vulgarity. To
try an adoption (62) leaves a gap in the
thought that even literary interpreta-
tion fails to fill. Grappling with hoops
and dulling ones palm (64, 65) are idi-
oms quite strange to modern thinking;
our entertainment like entrance (66)
suggests but does not convey Polonius s
meaning. Comrade (65) with the ac-
cent on the first syllable spoils the mea-
sure. Bearing a quarrel (67) is again
an impossible thought in Modern Eng-
lish, and the only possible meaning
of Modern English bear, namely,
endure, which you can put with
quarrel to patch out a literary
sense is so obviously at variance with
the rest of the verse that its absurdity
is apparent even from a literary
standpoint. You can perhaps still give
an ear to a person (68), but you can-
not give him a voice. Opposed (67),
which we do not now call op-pos-ed,
and should not use as a substantive, has
an artificial sound that the word did not
know in Shakespeares time, when op-
pose still had its local meaning, to
place opposite. Censure (69) will be-
tray you into thinking that Laertes is
to be silent under criticism; very good
advice, but not that his father gave
him. Expressed in fancy (71) does not
now convey the idea displayed fantas-
tically, though perhaps with the help
of the context and generous inference
such a meaning might be tortured out
of the words. Proclaims (72), again,
is not a figure of speech, which it seems
to be in the modern readers mind. Are
of a most sclect and generous chief in
that (74) is sheer nonsense. Numerous
attempts have been made to doctor the
passage into something like intelligibil</PB>

ity. Taking it as it stands, it is likely
that chief is a sophistication of shef
(our sheaj). Spelling was not fixed in
the sixteenth century as it is now, so that
eh often represented the sound sh. For
example, in Hamlet, I. ii. 82, shapes ap-
pears in the Quarto of 1604 as chapes.
The spelling of the Folio cheff proba-
bly represents what is now sheaf (in
Shakespeares time it was called shelf,
rhyming nearly with our safe). That be-
ing the case, sheaf should be the word in
our texts, and Stauntons citation of Ben
Jonsons It is found in noblemen and
gentlemen of the best sheaf, and I
am so haunted - - - with your refined
spirits that it makes me clean of another
garb, another sheaf, sufficiently ex-
plains the passage. Shakespeares gen-
erous, however, by no means corre-
sponds to Modern English generous.
	So we might go on through Hamlet
and through the rest of Shakespeares
plays, showing that modern reading
of Shakespeare is largely botching the
words up to fit the readers thought.
This is not a peculiarly difficult passage,
and it is one of those oftenest read; it is
perfectly fair, therefore, to assume its
difficulties, both in number and in quali-
ty, as being fairly representative of those
that would he met anywhere. Yet with-
in the compass of these seventeen lines
there are nineteen forms of expression
which an average educated man would
fail partially or wholly to understand in
the sense in which understanding has
been defined. Is it putting the matter
too strongly, then, to say we do not
understand Shakespeare? Suppose the
mistakes we made were half the number:
ought we not to blush when we declaim
about our knowledge of Shakespeare and
what we have done for Shakespeare?
And it is not Homer or Virgil or Dante,
but it is the supreme poet of our own
race and our own language, that we are
so ignorant of. What wonder? We
devote most of our educational energy
to studying foreign tongues and foreign
literature. We carry on the stupid pre-
judice of our ancestors against our ver-
nacular, and study the language and lit-
erature of Greece and of Rome! When
shall we shake ourselves free from the
Renaissance,  the ball and chain of
culture? Have nt we nearly served out
our sentence? When shall we cease to
educate ourselves as citizens of Athens,
and learn to be American? How long
shall we have to wait before there is a
home made in our educational system
for the intelligent study of our own lan-
guage and its literature? How long
shall we condemn our children to igno-
rance of that which they ought to know
best of all? When shall we gain inde-
pendence enough to point criticism to
our own literature and say, Go nQt to
Athens, go not to Rome, seek not Italy
or France or Germany, but weigh and
consider this, and see if there be not here
enough pure gold to furnish you forth
with standards of worth?
	Most readers of Shakespeare sooner
or later come to the conclusion that this
vagueness, which they name the liter-
ary way of saying things, is one of
the chief characteristics of Shakespeare.
They call the same thing quaintness in
Chaucer, where they are more often en-
tirely out of their reckoning. It is really
ignorance,  ignorance of English and
lack of English culture. The danger
of absolute mistake can be somewhat
minimized, it is true, by constant resort
to notes and commentaries ; but the
notes, many of which are historic ab-
surdities, are written mostly by scholars
who look upon Shakespeare as Modern
English and are continually liable to
misunderstandings just like those which
beset the general reader; for too often,
like him, they depend upon literary
instinct rather than upon actual know-
ledge to guide them. But suppose the
notes are in every case just what they
ought to be, reading Shakespeare by
their help is an artificial process: the
knowledge the reader gets by it does not</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00473" SEQ="0473" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="467">	Botching Shakespeare.	467

abide by him; it is discrete, unconnect-
ed, so that every time he reads a new
play of Shakespeares he has to wade
through more notes. What wonder,
then, that he should get tired of hobbling
along on these crutches! What wonder
that, as in the case of Chaucer, he should
leave Shakespeare to be read by those
who have more knowledge and more
time for it than he has. Is not Shake-
speare in this way losing his hold on us?
As his language grows more dim to our
sense, and we continue to be careless
about learning it, will not the time come
when Shakespeare will be little more than
a great name iu our literature?
	Now I would not say that we have
already lost Shakespeare, or that we shall
lose Shakespeare within the space of a
generation. What I would say is that
we can in this way lose Shakespeare, and
more easily, too, than we think. We
English-speaking people have already
been advised to abandon Chaucer,  in
a journal, it is true, whose advice is not
usually worth the taking, but such straws
show the way the current sets. Perhaps
it will be some time before any one will
boldly tell us to give up Shakespeare, and
thus show that Shakespeare is already
practically given up. But if it is true that
we have lost Chaucer as popular litera-
ture, that we have lost Spenser as popular
literature, that we are losing Milton as
popular literature, how shall we ulti-
mately escape losing Shakespeare? Of
course, we can selfishly say that Shake-
speare will last our time, and the future
can take care of itself; or we can fall
back on a narrow ideal of culture, and
say that there will always be enough
scholars among English-speaking people
to keep the light burning before Shake-
speares shrine; or we can ignore the
facts, and grandiloquently say that
Shakespeare is for all time. But the day
may come when Shakespeare will be
added to Chaucer, and we shall have in
literature a Rachel weeping for her chil-
dren, and not to be comforted.
	For, in the first place, it is the general
reader who makes a national literature.
Now the chief characteristic of great lit-
erature, and the one that gives it the
strongest hold on experience, is the per-
tinence of its appeal. The mind of him
who reads recognizes something that
concerns him, an experience which is
identical with his, though the person who
has it is widely separated from him in
space and time; thus a bond of sym-
pathy is created, and the molecule of hu~
man experience gets hold of itself as
part of humanity. In its last analysis,
the bond is that clear, terse expression,
that graphic picture, which reveals this
outside experience to him not as words,
but as life. The sharpness and clearness
of this expression, while it is life, de-
pends upon words. The words must be
so aptly the right ones that they are re-
cognized and understood by the mind
without effort, because they are part
of its own thinking machinery. But
the words must be generic, also; that is,
they must convey the expression not to
one man only, but to thousands. They
must be the embodied thought of a race
fixed in forms native to its thinking.
In other words, they must be immediate-
ly intelligible to the general reader.
	It follows as a corollary that while
a foreign literature can be read and ap-
preciated by a process through which
native words rapidly and fittingly take
the place of foreign ones, a nations best
and most vital literature must always be
that which is written in its vernacular.
It might be added as a further corollary
that a peoples strength is in direct pro-
portion to the strength of their native
literature, and that a nation which neg~
lects its literature to follow after a for-
eign one is sowing the seeds of national
decay.
	For purposes of literature, therefore,
no thought is understood unless it is
understood perfectly, with that sort of
understanding which we have already
spoken of,  understanding that is im</PB>

mediate perception. The shaft must go
straight to the mark and stick in the
gold. All great literature has this di-
rectness and simplicity. It is this that
makes it great. We may easily humbug
ourselves into thinking that other writing
which has not this quality is great, that
Mr. Gigadibs is our modern Shakespeare.
This humbug may even become general
enough to make Mr. Gigadibss book oc-
cupy for a while a place beside Shake-
speare on our library shelves; but there
comes a time, and it comes swiftly, too,
when Mr. Gigadibss book goes to the lum-
ber-room, with other discarded toys of his
generation. It is one of the marvelous
things of historyhow unerring, in the long
run, the selection of time is. If we go back
to the very beginning of our own litera-
ture and examine what has survived,
comparing it with contemporary Ger-
manic literature, we discover that what
we possess of it must have been of the
best produced; or if we run over the
ground of Middle-English literature, we
find that Piers Plowmans Vision and the
Canterbury Tales are the pieces which
were oftenest copied, and so ran the
least risk of destruction in coming down
to us. Now the basis of this historical
selection is universal pertinence, simpli-
city, directness. In the long run people
read what they can understand perfectly,
and they make this literature. It is not
the best of what has been thought and
said in the world, but what has been
thought and said the best. No other
piece of English writing has taken such
a hold on the English thinking race as
Hamlets soliloquy on suicide. Its mat-
ter is the veriest commonplace,  the
theme of the college sophomore for
generations; parodied, hackneyed, de-
claimed, misquoted, it still stands the
most magnificent piece of writing in
English. Why? Because this common
thought of this common man is clothed
in common words; because the words
come straight from his own experience,
without garnish or ornament other than
that the thought itself wore; because
they go straight to the core of the com-
monest experience of humanity, without
other help or assistance than that the
understanding alone can furnish. Ham-
let, and indeed all of Shakespeare, is an
appeal to the general reader. In fact,
not much of Shakespeare would have
come down to us, had we had to depend
on a purely literary public for its trans-
mission to posterity.
	Not only does the general reader thus
make a national literature, he also keeps
it alive. It is but an artificial life which
literature lives in school and university
textbooks, and among special students
and scholars. When the people who,
by their previous education and present
surroundings, are in a position to draw
help and strength from the great books
in their own language abandon those
books to read something else in their
moments of leisure, their literature is
practically dead. Their children may
study it in school; they themselves may
talk about it, and glibly, too; but if
they do not read it because they want to
read it, preferring to read criticism of
it, or to read contemporary fiction, or to
peruse the newspapers, for them what
they are pleased to call their literature
is but a figment of the imagination,  it
has no reality. In short, a peoples lit-
erature is what they read, not what they
read about, or talk about, or would like
to read. It makes no difference what
the reason for the abandonment is; the
result is the same. It may be for idle.
ness, it might be because the books of it
were unattainable; but anything which
serves to keep a people away from their
literature will eventually cause them to
lose it.
	In the case of Shakespeare the obsta-
cle might easily be the lack of a clear
understandingof Shakespeareslanguage.
Inferential interpretation has a certain
attraction for the scholar, and his ap-
parent success in it gives him continual
ground for gratification; but it worries</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00475" SEQ="0475" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="469">	Botching Shakespeare.	469

and wearies the general reader, who is
discouraged and humiliated by his obvi-
ous failure in it. It becomes with him
a question between spending an hour or
more over fifty lines of Shakespeare in
order to understand them thoroughly,
and reading five times as many higgledy-
piggledy to get the best sense he can.
What wonder that in nine cases out of
ten he chooses the easier course! His
schoolboy days are over, and he does
not like to think that he must take a
schoolboys attitude to Shakespeare; it
is not hard for him, therefore, to per-
suade himself that he can read it well
enough. It is so fatally easy for any
one, scholar or general reader, to per-
suade himself that he understands what
he knows nothing about! But the kind
of reading he does takes little hold on
him; it is not Shakespeare, though there
is some Shakespeare in it,  in many
cases enough to hold his attention and
keep his enthusiasm for a time, and when
all is said, enough to justify to him the
place Shakespeare holds in our litera-
ture. It goes in at one ear and out at
the other. It is a thing apart from his
life. His brain, active all day in schemes
to educate his sons and daughters, re-
fuses the extra burden such reading puts
upon it. So as he grows older he reads
Shakespeare less and less. This man is
one of a class the most numerous and the
strongest in our American life; when he
ceases to read Shakespeare, literature is
already among us a decadent art. Have
we not some reason to fear, then, that we
may lose Shakespeare out of our national
literature?
	The loss would be one which for
some time we might be quite unconscious
of.	We all know how easy it is for the
individual to excuse his own neglect of
duty by assuming that every one else is
doing what he knows he ought to do,
and that therefore his effort is unneces-
sary. That it is thus possible for no-
body to do what everybody ought to do
has become fixed in the proverb, Every
bodys business is nobodys~bnsiness,
a proverb which might easily run, What
everybody reads, nobody reads. We
all know that yearly a certain number
of books are made and sold to be put
	in every gentlemans library, but how
many gentlemen read them? It is not
necessary, then, to infer that good books
are always read by the persons who buy
them. We might lose Shakespeare from
our national literature, and still go on
talking about Shakespeare, and buying
sumptuous editions of Shakespeare, and
reading books of Shakespeare criticism;
the danger is in forgetting to read
Shakespeare.
	And we shall lose this our ricbest lit-
erary possession if we do not take care.
If we go on cajoling ourselves in the be-
lief that, to read Shakespeare, all one
needs is a knowledge of every-day Eng-
lish and a copiously annotated edition of
Shakespeares works; that it is not neces-
sary to know the language of Shake-
speares time; that we have got along
fairly well hitherto without much study
of English, and things are good enough
the way they are; that we can go on in
our neglect with impunity,  we shall
find one of these days that we have lost
Shakespeare, that the kind of English
literature Shakespeare represents really
plays no more part in the lives of the
mass of us than the Vedas do.
	If we are going to keep Shakespeare,
we must understand Shakespeare. Now,
to understand Shakespeare, we do not
need more notes on Shakespeares text,
more variorum editions of Shakespeare,
more transcendental lectures on Shake-
speares life and work. Most of us
will agree that in these respects abridg-
ment with better quality is the thing we
need. What we do want is a wide-
spread understanding of Shakespeares
language,  nay, of English,  an un-
derstanding wide and broad enough to
reach into the public schools and touch
the masses; that for every child who can
decline a Latin noun, there will be two</PB>

who know the rudiments of English his-
torical grammar; for every boy who is
reading C~sars Gallic Wars, there will
be five reading Chaucers Prologue; for
every college student who can read
Homers archaic Greek and be uncon-
scious of its archaic form, there will be
ten who can read Beowulf without hav-
ing to translate it into broken-backed,
cumbrous, impossible New English com-
pounds; for every critic who grows en-
thusiastic over the human and humanis-
tic qualities of the Iliad, there will be a
hundred who take these things and the
knowledge of them for granted on every
page of Shakespeares plays.
	Is such an end possible? Why should
nt it be? Why should we be gaining a
fresher knowledge and a deeper insight
into the development of our political life,
and remain ignorant of the development
of our literature? Why should we be
clever, shrewd, untiring, in the one field,
and stand imbecile in the other? If we
do not know these things, why cant we
learn them? Is English such a perplex-
ing subject that it can be understood only
by the most scholarly professors in our
best universities? The difficulty of at-
taining such a knowledge, granting that it
is great, ought rather to be an invitation
to energy than a temptation to despair;
and when once it is attained, the task of
presenting it ought to he easy; for Eng-
lish speech is the first thing we learn, and
the last we forget. Let us grant for the
nonce, though it is by no means true, that
up to Shakespeare there is no literature in
English, save a small part of Chaucer,
that is worth the students study. Let
us admit all the poverty which people
who cannot read it allege against our ear-
liest literary efforts. If the study of it is
going to teach us to understand Shake-
speare, it is surely worth the wading
through. Let your student who yearns
after literary form try to get it from
Greek and Latin if he wants to, hut give
your average student, who is going to
turn into an American citizen before
long, some rudimentary knowledge of
what the speech he uses is, how it has
grown to be what it is, and how he can
use it to the best advantage. Then
bring him to the best literature in it,
opening, perchance, a door that will
never he closed all his life through.
Make him read the great books of it in-
telligently, till they are instinct with life.
Give him a knowledge of his language
so that he can do this easily, uncon-
sciously, so that the act of reading
Shakespeare will he no guesswork, but a
sure-footed progress to a distinct goal.
	For it is the knowledge of Shake-
speares language as English, rich, vital
English, that we want, not notes and
emendations. It is the knowledge of
his speech as a living speech, to his pur-
pose more pregnant than our speech is
to ours, a familiarity with its sound and
form such that there seems nothing un-
usual in it as we read, an acquaintance
with its syntax so intimate that we could
think Elizabethan syntax, if need were
 in short, we want a knowledge of
English that will enable us to read
Shakespeare without translating it, to
read Chaucer, too, without resorting to
translation. For our translations of
Shakespeare and Chaucer are always
worse than those we make for Virgil
and Horace, because we hold on to all
the forms and words which have any
resemblance to those we use now, and
thus produce a sort of bastard-English
that never existed in any English mind.
And this sort of stuff we put into the
mouths of Chaucer and Shakespeare!
And we are English-speaking people,
thinking with the language Chaucer and
Shakespeare wrote! We prefer to go
on in this way, reading some of our
best literature lamely, haltingly, because
in our educational system, planned out
to suit medheval conditions, no place is
left for the proper study of our native
language. We think we should be fly-
ing in the face of educational providence
if we moved the study of a foreign lit-</PB>

erature far enough aside to make room
for the intelligent study of our own. But
no upheaval of our educational system
is necessary: a few years of sound ele-
nientary teaching of English is all we
want  just enough to let the student
read Chaucer and Shakespeare (perhaps,
too, Beowulf, though we do not nee~l to
add that yet), in the original, with a
feeling of sureness and ease. If we are
too timorous to do all this at once, let us
start with Shakespeare and Elizabethan
English. That will be good enough for
a beginning. Let us set ourselves to
teach our children to read Shakespeare
in the original (that is, not in Modern
English transcriptions), without notes
and glossary except where they are ne-
cessary to explain passages that are ob-
vious nonsense, or meaningless through
ignorance of some contemporary condi-
tions.
	Now it is possible, and easily possible,
to get in a short time a knowledge of
Shakespeares language such that the
inferential process through which we
arrive at an understanding of his words
by substituting for them words of our
own can largely be done away with for
the average educated man who reads
Shakespeare. Of course there will re-
main a number of passages in which
careless transmission of Shakespeares
th6ught brings it to us in unintelligible
form. But it is not too much to hope
that common sense and a knowledge of
English will do much to reduce the num-
ber. The knowledge that the form and
content of English words are constantly
changing, and that the ways of putting
them together are likewise changing
constantly, will be a thing that the stu-
dent can start with. A familiarity with
the sound and form of Elizabethan Eng-
lish presented in the light of its histor-
ical development ought to be easily ob-
tainable by any one understanding the
rudiments of English, from a years
study of a properly arranged textbook
upon the subject,  a textbook which
could be used in elementary schools at a
time wheii a student is usually initiated
into the mysteries of Greek. For, like
all grammatical study, this is elementary
work, and ought to be finished before
the student gets into the uiiiversity.
With these two things to start with,
American common sense and American
teaching ability might be left to wrestle
with the problem alone without much
concern as to the result.
	We shall then be able to read Shake-
speare without resorting to the subter-
fuge through which we excuse our lack
of understanding on the ground that
Shakespeare wrote in a literary way.
We shall get the magnificent range and
sweep of his words with a sure sympathy
born of positive knowledge, not of liter-
ary affectation, and more of us will gain
sureness and sweep in the use of our own.
	Is not the effort worth our while? Is
not Shakespeares English worth more
to us than Homers Greek? Is not a
scientific knowledge of the language that
we think in, talk in, read in, buy and sell
in, save and lose our immortal souls in,
of more consequence to us than a super-
ficial familiarity with the academic in-
tricacies of Greek and Latin grammar?
Jn Shakespeare we have a poet who has
put into this language, as sensitive and
tremulous under his touch as the strings
of a harp, the deepest experience that
we have yet known or are capable of, in
terms of the life we live every day, and
in words our mothers use to us all our
lives through,  a poet who is rightly
regarded, not as the supreme poet of
our race and language only, but as the
supreme poet of the whole world; and
we devote a couple of years of dabbling,
desultory, dilettante study to his work,
and spend seven or eight on learning to
read Virgil and Homer! If we have
many and good courses in schools and
colleges to teach us to understand Ho-
mers Greek, ought we not to have more
and better courses to teach us Shake-
speares English? We are told that we

go through this routine of classical study
in order that we may better understand
literature. But what good is such an
understanding of literature to give us, if
we cannot read intelligently and easily
the language that the best of our own
literature has been written in? What
study of our literature will be of any
avail that does not take into account its
development and its continual relation
to the life of the people that produced

duty to our children equally plain, to

for our having used it, this literature the

in order that we may better understand
literature. But what good is such an
understanding of literature to give us, if
we cannot read intelligently and easily
the language that the best of our own
literature has been written in? What
study of our literature will be of any
avail that does not take into account its
development and its continual relation
to the life of the people that produced
it? How long are we to listen to histo-

To maintain such numbers of ser-
vants as were kept in our house would
have been simply ruinous, if it had been
necessary to buy all our provisions at
Moscow; but in those times of serfdom
things were managed very simply. When
winter came, father sat at his table and
wrote the following 
To the manager of my estate, Nik6b
skoye, situated in the government of
Kaldga, district of Mesch6vsk, on the
river Sirena, from the Prince Alex~i
Petr6vich Krop6tkin, Colonel and Com-
mander of various orders.
	On receipt of this, and as soon as
winter communication is established, thou
art ordered to send to my house, situ-
ated in the city of Moscow, twentj-flve
peasant - sledges, drawn by two horses
each, one horse from each house, and one

ber so and so, in due time and in good
condition. Some time before Christmas
the twenty-five peasant-sledges really en-
tered our gates, and covered the surface
of the wide yard.
	Frol! shouted my father, as soon
as the report of this great event reached
him. Kiry4shka! Yeg6rka! Where
are they? Everything will be stolen!
Frol, go and receive the oats! Ulitina,
go and receive the poultry! Kiryfishka,
call the princess!
	All the household was in commotion,
the servants running wildly in every di-
rection, from the hall to the yard, and
from the yard to the hall, but chiefly to
the maidservants room, to communi-
cate there the Nik6lskoye news: P1-
sha is going to marry after Christmas.
Aunt Anna has surrendered her soul to
God, and so on. Letters had also come
from the country, and very soon one of
the maids would steal upstairs into my
room.
	Are you alone? The teacher is not
in?
	No, he is at the university.
	Well, then, be so good as to read me
this letter from mother.
	And I would read to her the naive let-
ter, which always began with the words,
Father and mother send you their bless-
ings for ages not to be broken. After
this came the news: Aunt Eupraxie lies
ill, all her bones aching; and your cousin
is not yet married, but hopes to be after
Easter. Following the news came the
greetings, two pages of them: Brother
Paul sends you his greetings, and the
sisters Mary and Dtiria send their greet-
ings, and then uncle Dmftri sends his
many greetings, and so on. However,
notwithstanding the monotony of the enu-
meration, each name awakened some re-
marks: Then she is still alive, poor
soul, if she sends her greetings; it is nine
years since she has lain motionless. Or,
Oh, he has not forgotten me; he must
be back, then, for Christmas; such a nice
boy. You will write me a letter, wont
you? and I must not forget him then.
I promised, of course, and when the time
came I wrote a letter in exactly the same
style.
	When the sledges had been unloaded,
the hall filled with peasants. They had
put on their best coats over their sheep-
skins, and waited until father should call
them into his room to have a talk about
the snow and the prospects of the next
crops. They hardly dared to walk in
their heavy boots on the polished floor.
A few ventured to sit down on the edge
of an oak bench; they emphatically re-
fused to make use of chairs. So they
waited for hours, looking with alarm upon
every one who entered fathers room or
issued from it.
	Some time later on, usually next morn-
ing, one of the servants would run slyly
upstairs to the class-room.
	Are you alone?
	Yes.
	Then go quickly to the hall. The
peasants want to see you; something
from your nurse.~~
	When I went down to the hall, one of
the peasants would give me a little bun-
dle containing perhaps a few rye cakes,
half a dozen hard-boiled eggs, and some
apples, tied in a motley colored cotton
kerchief. Take that: it is your nurse,
Vasilisa, who sends it to you. Look if
the apples are not frozen. I hope not:
I kept them all the journey on my breast.
Such a fearful frost we had. And the
broad, bearded face, covered with frost.
bites, would smile radiantly, showing two
rows of beautiful white teeth from be-
neath quite a forest of hair.
	And this is for your brother, from
his nurse Anna, another peasant would
say, handing me a similar bundle.
Poor boy, she says, he must never
have enough at school.
	Blushing and not knowing what to say,
I would murmur at last, Tell Vasilisa
that I kiss her, and Anna too, for my
brother. At which all faces would be-
come still more radiant.</PB>

	Yes, I will, to be sure.
	Then Kirfia, who kept watch at fa-
thers door, would whisper suddenly,
Run quickly upstairs; your father may
come out in a moment. Dont forget
the kerchief; they want to take it back.
	As I carefully folded the worn ker-
chief, I most passionately desired to send
Yasilisa something. But I had nothing
to send, not even a toy, and we never
had pocket-money.

	Our best time, of course, was in the
country. As soon as Easter and Whit-
suntide had passed, all our thoughts
were directed toward Nik6lskoye. How-
ever, time went on,  the lilacs must
be through blooming at iNik6lskoye, 
and father had still thousands of af-
fairs to keep him in town. At last, five
or six peasant-carts entered our yard:
they came to take all sorts of things
which had to be sent to the country
house. The great old coach and the
other coaches in which we were going to
make the journey were taken out and
inspected once more. The boxes began to
be packed. Our lessons made slow pro-
gress; at every moment we interrupted
our teachers, asking whether this or that
book should be taken with us, and long
before all others we began packing our
books, our slates, and our few toys.
	Everything was ready: the peasant-
carts stood heavily loaded with furniture
for the country house, boxes containing
the kitchen utensils, and almost countless
empty glass jars which were to be brought
back in the autumn filled with all kinds
of preserves. The peasants waited every
morning for hours in the hall; but the
order for leaving did not come. Father
continued to write all the morning in his
room, and disappeared at night. Final-
ly, our stepmother interfered, her maid
having ventured to report that the pea-
sants were very anxious to return, as hay-
making was near.
	Next afternoon, Frol, the major-domo,
and Mikh~el Al~eff, the first violin, were
called into fathers room. A sack con-
taining the food money  that is, a
few coppers a day  for each of the
forty or fifty souls who were to accom-
pany the household to Nik6lskoye, was
handed to Frol, with a list. All were
enumerated in that list: the band in full;
then the cooks and the under-cooks, the
laundresses, the under-laundress who was
blessed with a family of six mites, Polka
Squinting, Domna the Big One,
Domna the Small One, and the rest
of them.
The first violin received an order of
march. I knew it well, because father,
seeing that he never would be ready, had
called me to copy it into the book, in
which he used to copy all outgoing
papers: 
To my bouse servant, Mikhael A16-
eff, from Prince Alexfi Petr6vich Kro-
p6tkin, Colonel and Commander.
	Thou art ordered, on May 29th, at
six A. ivi., to march out with my loads,
from the city of Moscow, for my estate,
situated in the government of Kahiga,
district of Mesch6vsk, on the river Si-
r6na, representing a distance of one hun-
dred and sixty miles from this house;
to look after the good conduct of the
men entrusted to thee, and if any one of
them proves to be guilty of misconduct
or of drunkenness or of insubordination,
to bring the said man before the com-
mander of the garrison detachment of
the separate corps of the interior gar-
risons, with the inclosed circular letter,
and to ask that he may be punished by
flogging [the first violin knew who was
meant], as an example to the others.
	Thou art ordered, moreover, to look
especially after the integrity of the goods
entrusted to thy care, and to march ac-
cording to the following order: First
day, stop at village So and So, to feed
the horses; second day, spend the night
at the town of Podolsk; and so on for
all the seven or eight days that the jour-
ney would last.
	Next day, at ten instead of at six, </PB>

punctuality is not a Russian virtue, 
the carts left the house. The servants
had to make the journey on foot; only
the children were accommodated with a
seat in a bath-tub or basket, on the top
of a loaded cart, and some of the wo-
men might find an occasional resting-
place on the rim of a cart. The others
had to walk all the hundred and sixty
miles. As long as they were marching
through Moscow, discipline was main-
tained: it was peremptorily forbidden
to wear top-boots or to pass a belt over
the coat. But when they were on the
road, and we overtook them a couple of
days later, and especially when it was
known that father would stay a few
days longer at Moscow, the men and
the women  dressed in all sorts of im-
possible coats, belted with cotton hand-
kerchiefs, burned by the sun or dripping
under the rain, and helping themselves
along with sticks cut in the woods 
certainly looked more like a wandering
band of gypsies than the household of a
wealthy landowner. Similar peregrina-
tions were made by every household in
those times, and when we saw a file of
servants marching along one of our
streets, we at once knew that the
Apukhtins or the Pryanishnikoffs were
migrating.
	The carts were gone, yet the family
did not move. All of us were sick of
waiting; but father still continued to
write interminable orders to the man-
agers of his estates, and I copied them
diligently into the big outgoing book.
At last the order to start was given.
We were called downstairs. My father
read aloud the order of march, addressed
to the Princess Krop6tkin, wife of
Prince Alex6i Petr6vich Krop6tkin,
Colonel and Commander, in which the
halting-places during the five days jour-
ney were duly enumerated. True, the
order was written for May 30, and the
departure was fixed for nine A. ~i., though
May was gone, and the departure took
place in the afternoon: this upset all cal-
culations. But, as is usual in military
marching-orders, this circumstance had
been foreseen, and was provided for in
the following paragraph : 
If, however, contrary to expectation,
the departure of your highness does not
take place at the said day and hour, you
are requested to act according to the best
of your understanding, in order to bring
the said journey to its best issue.
	Then, all present, the family and the
servants, sat down for a moment, signed
themselves with the cross, and bade my
father good-by. I entreat you, Alexis,
dont go to the club, our stepmother
whispered to him. The great coach,
drawn by four horses, with a postilion,
stood at the door, with its little folding
ladder to facilitate climbing in; the
other coaches also were there. Our seats
were enumerated in the marching - or-
ders, but our stepmother had to exercise
the best of her understanding even
at that early stage of the proceedings,
and we started to the great satisfaction
of all.
	The journey was an inexhaustible
source of enjoyment for us children.
The stages were short, and we stopped
twice a day to feed the horses. As the
ladies screamed at the slightest declivity
of the road, it was found more conven-
ient to alight each time the road went
np or down hill, which it did continu-
ally, and we took advantage of this to
have a peep into the woods by the road-
side, or a run along some crystal brook.
The beautifully kept highroad from Mos-
cow to Warsaw, which we followed for
some distance, was covered, moreover,
with a variety of interesting objects: files
of loaded carts, groups of pilgrims, and
all sorts of people. Twice a day we
stopped in big, animated villages, and
after a good deal of bargaining about the
prices to be charged for hay and oats, as
well as for the samovars, we dismounted
at the gates of an inn. Cook Andrei
bought a chicken and made the soup,
while we ran in the meantime to the</PB>

next wood, or examined the yard of the
great inn.
	At M~iloyarosk~vetz, where a battle
was fought in 1812, when the Russian
army vainly attempted to stop Napoleon
in his retreat from Moscow, we usually
spent the night. M. Poulain, who had
been wounded in the Spanish campaign,
knew, or pretended to know, everything
about the battle at Maloyaroslt~vetz. He
took us to the battlefield, and explained
how the Russians tried to check Napo-
leons advance, and how the Grande
Arm6e crushed them and made its way
through the Russian lines. He explained
it as well as if he himself had taken
part in the battle. Here the Cossacks
attempted un mouvement tournant, but
Davoust, or some other marshal, routed
them and pursued them just beyond these
hills on the right. There the left wing
of Napoleon crushed the Russian infan-
try, and here Napoleon himself, at the
head of the Old Guard, charged Kutii-
zoffs centre, and covered himself and
his Guard with undying glory.
	We once took the old Kahulga route,
and stopped at Tarutino; but here Pou-
lain was much less eloquent. For it was
at this place that Napoleon, who intend-
ed to retreat by a southern route, was
compelled, after a bloody battle, to aban-
don that plan, and was forced to follow
the Smolensk route, which his army had
laid waste during its march on Moscow.
But still  so it appeared in Poulains
narrative  Napoleon was deceived by
his marshals; otherwise he would have
marched straight upon Kieff and Odessa,
and his eagles would have floated over
the Black Sea.
	Beyond Kahiga we had to cross for
a stretch of five miles a beautiful pine
forest, which remains connected in my
memory with some of the happiest re-
miniscences of my childhood. The sand
in that forest was as deep as in an Afri-
can desert, and we went all the way on
foot, while the horses, stopping every
moment, slowly dragged the carriages
in the sand. When I was in my teens,
it was my delight to leave the family
behind, and to walk the whole distance
by myself. Immense red pines, centuries
old, rose on every side, and not a sound
reached the ear except the voices of these
lofty trees. In a small ravine a fresh
crystal spring murmured, and a passer-
by had left by it, for the use of those
who should come after him, a small fun-
nel-shaped ladle, made of birch bark, with
a split stick for a handle. Noiselessly a
squirrel ran up a tree, and the under-
wood was as full of mysteries as were
the trees. In that forest my first love
of nature and my first dim perception
of its incessant life were born.
	Beyond the forest, and past the ferry
which took us over the Ugra, we left the
highroad and entered narrow country
lanes, where green ears of rye bent to-
ward the coach, and the horses managed
to bite mouthfuls of grass on either side
of the way, as they ran, closely pressed
to one another in the narrow, trenchlike
road. At last we caught sight of the
three willows which marked the ap-
proach to our own village, and all of a
sudden we saw the beautiful yellow bell
tower of the Nik6lskoye church.
	For the quiet life of the landlords of
those times Nik6lskoye was admirably
suited. There was nothing in it of the
luxury which is seen in richer estates;
but an artistic hand was visible in the
planning of the buildings and gardens,
and in the general arrangement of things.
Besides the main house, which father
had recently built, there were, round a
spacious and well - kept yard, several
smaller houses, which, while they gave a
greater degree of independence to their
inhabitants, did not destroy the close in-
tercourse of the family life. An im-
mense upper garden was devoted to
fruit trees, and through it the church
was reached; the southern slope of the
land, which led to the river, was entirely
given up to a pleasure garden, where
flower-beds were intermingled with al</PB>

leys of lime trees, lilacs, and acacias.
From the balcony of the main house
there was a beautiful view of the river,
with the ruins of an old earthen fortress
where the Russians offered a stubborn
resistance during the Mongol invasion,
and further on a great area of yellow
grain-fields bordered by woods.
	In the early years of my childhood we
occupied with M. Poulain one of the sepa-
rate houses entirely by ourselves; and
after his method of education was soft-
ened by the intervention of our sister
H~lime, we were on the best possible
terms with him. Father was invariably
absent from home in the summer, which
he spent in military inspections, and our
stepmother did not pay much attention
to us, especially after her own child was
born. We were thus always with M.
Poulain, who thoroughly enjoyed the stay
in the country, and let us enjoy it. The
woods; the walks along the river; the
climbing over the hills to the old fortress,
which Poulain made alive for us as he
told how it was defended by the Rus-
sians, and how it was captured by the
Tartars; the little adventures, in one of
which Poulain became our hero by saving
Alexander from drowning,  yielded no
end of new and delightful impressions.
Large parties were organized, also, in
which all the family took part, some-
times picking mushrooms in the woods,
and afterward having tea in the midst of
the forest, where a man a hundred years
old lived alone with his little grandson,
taking care of bees. At other times we
went to one of fathers villages where a
big pond had been dug, in which golden
carp could be caught. My former nurse
lived in that village. Her family was one
of the poorest; besides her husband, she
had only a small boy to help her, and a
girl, my foster-sister, who became later
on a preacher and a virgin in the
Nonconformist sect to which they be-
longed. There was no bound to her joy
when I came to see her. Cream, eggs,
apples, and honey were all that she could
offer; but the way in which she offered
them, in bright wooden plates, after hav-
ing covered the table with a fine snow-
white linen tablecloth of her own make
(with the Russian Nonconformists abso-
lute cleanliness is a matter of religion),
and the fond words with which she ad-
dressed me, treating me as her own son,
left the warmest feelings in my heart. I
must say the same of the nurses of my
elder brothers, Nicholas and Alexander,
who belonged to prominent families of
two other Nonconformist sects in Nik6l-
skoye. Few know what treasuries of
goodness can be found in the hearts of
Russian peasants, even after centuries
of the most shameful oppression, which
might well have embittered them.
	On stormy days M. Poulain had an
abundance of tales to tell us, especially
about the campaign in Spain. Over and
over again we induced him to tell us how
he was wounded in a battle, and every
time he came to the point when he felt
warm blood streaming into his boot, we
jumped to kiss him and gave him all
sorts of pet names.
	Everything seemed to prepare us for
the military career: the predilection of
our father (the only toys that I remem-
ber his having bought for us were a rifle
and a real sentry-box); the war tales of
M. Poulain; nay, even the library which
we had at our disposal. This library,
which had once belonged to General
Repninsky, our mothers grandfather, a
learned military man of the eighteenth
century, consisted exclusively of books
on military warfare, adorned with rich
plates and beautifully bound in leather.
It was our chief recreation, on wet days,
to look over the plates of these books, re-
presenting the weapons of warfare since
the times of the Hebrews, and giving
plans of all the battles that had been
fought since Alexander of Macedonia.
These books also instructed us how to
build strong fortresses which would stand
for some time the blows of a battering-
ram, as well as those from an Archime</PB>

dean catapult (which, however, persisted
in sending stones into the windows, and
was soon prohibited). Yet neither Al-
exander nor I became a military man.
The literature of the sixties wiped out
the teachings of our childhood.
	M. Poulains opinions about revolu-
tions were those of the Orleanist Illus-
tration Fran~aise, of which he received
back numbers, and of which we knew the
woodcuts. For a long time I could not
imagine a revolution otherwise than in
the shape of Death riding on a horse, the
red flag in one hand and a scythe in the
other, mowing down men right and left.
But I now think that M. Poulains dis-
like was limited to the uprising of 1848,
for one of his tales about the Revolution
of 1789 deeply impressed my mind.
	The title of prince was used in our
house with and without occasion. M.
Poulain must have been shocked by it,
for he began once to tell us what he
knew of the great Revolution. I can-
not now recall what he said, but one thing
I remember, namely, that Count Mira-
beau and other nobles one day renounced
their titles, and that Count Mirabeau, to
show his contempt for aristocratic pre-
tensions, opened a shop decorated with
a signboard which bore the inscription,
Mirabeau, tailor. (I tell the story as
I had it from M. Poulain.) For a long
time after that I worried myself think-
ing what trade I could recognize as mine,
so as to write, Kropotkin, such a handi-
craft man. Later on, my Russian teach-
er, Nikoldi Pdvlovich Smirn6ff, and the
general republican tone of Russian lit-
erature influenced me in the same way;
and when I began to write novels  that
is, in my twelfth year  I adopted the
signature P. Kropotkin, which I never
have departed from, notwithstanding the
remonstrances of my chiefs when I was
in the military service.

VITT.

	In the autumn of 1852 my brother
Alexander was sent to the corps of ca
dets, and from that time we saw each
other only during the holidays and oc-
casionally on Sundays. The corps of
cadets was five miles from our house,
and although we had a dozen horses,
it always happened that when the time
came to send a sledge to the corps there
was no horse free for that purpose. My
eldest brother, Nicholas, came home very
seldom. The relative freedom which Al-
exander found at school, and especially
the influence of two of his teachers in
literature, developed his intellect rapidly,
and later on I shall have ample occasion
to speak of the beneficial influence that
he exercised upon my own development.
It is a great privilege to have a loving,
intelligent elder brother.
	In the meantime I remained at home.
I had to wait till my turn to enter the
corps of pages should come, and that
did not happen until I was nearly fifteen
years of age. M. Poulain was dismissed,
and a German tutor was engaged instead.
He was one of those idealistic men who
are not uncommon among Germans, but
I remember him chiefly on account of
the enthusiastic way in which he used to
recite Schillers poetry, accompanying
it by a most naive kind of acting that
delighted me. He stayed with us only
one winter.
	The next winter I was sent to attend
the classes at a Moscow gymnasium;
and finally I remained with our Russian
teacher, Smirn6ff. We soon became
friends, especially after my father took
both of us for a journey to his Ryazt~n
estate. During this journey we indulged
in all sorts of fun, and we used to invent
humorous stories in connection with the
men and the things that we saw; while
the impression produced upon me by the
hilly tracts we crossed added some new
and fine touches to my growing love of
nature. Under the impulse given me by
Smirn6ff, my literary tastes also began
to grow, and during the years from 1854
to 1857 I had full opportunity to de-
velop them. My teacher, who had by</PB>

this time finished his studies at the uni-
versity, obtained a small clerkship in a
law court, and spent his mornings there.
I was thus left to myself till dinner-time,
and after having prepared my lessons
and taken a walk, I had plenty of time
to read, and especially to write. In the
autumn, when my teacher returned to his
office at Moscow, while we remained in
the country, I was left again to myself,
and though in continual intercourse with
the family, and spending a good deal
of time in playing with my little sister
Pauline, I could in fact dispose of my
time as I liked for reading and writing.
	Serfdom was then in the last years of
its existenqe. It is recent history,  it
seems to be only of yesterday; and yet,
even in Russia, few realize what serfdom
was in reality. There is a dim concep-
tion that the conditions which it created
were very bad; but those conditions, as
they affected human beings bodily and
mentally, are not generally understood.
It is amazing, indeed, to see how quickly
an institution and its social consequences
are forgotten when the institution has
ceased to exist, and with what rapidity
men and things change. I will try to re-
call the conditions of serfdom by telling,
not what I heard, but what I saw.

	Uli~na, the housekeeper, stands in the
passage leading to fathers room, and
crosses herself; she dares neither to ad-
vance nor to retreat. At last, after hav-
ing recited a prayer, she enters the room,
and reports, in a hardly audible voice,
that the store of tea is nearly at an end,
that there are only twenty pounds of
sugar left, and that the other provisions
will soon be exhausted.
	Thieves, robbers! shouts my fa-
ther. And you, you are in league with
them! His voice thunders throughout
the house. Our stepmother leaves Uli-
gina to face the storm. But father cries,
Frol, call the princess! Where is she?
And when she enters, he receives her
with the same reproaches.
of a Revolutionist.
479
	You also are in league with this pro-
geny of Ham; you are standing up for
them; and so on, for half an hour or
more.
	Then he commences to verify the ac-
counts. At the same time, he thinks
about the hay. Frol is sent to weigh
what is left of that, and our stepmother
is sent to be present during the weighing,
while father calculates how much of it
ought to be in the barn. A considerable
quantity of hay appears to be missing,
and Ulidna cannot account for several
pounds of such and such provisions.
Fathers voice becomes more and more
menacing; Uli~na is trembling; but it
is the coachman who now enters the
room, and is stormed at by his master.
He keeps repeating, Your highness
must have made a mistake.
	Father repeats his calculations, and
this time it appears that there is more
hay in the barn than there ought to be.
The shouting continues; he now re-
proaches the coachman with not having
given the horses their daily rations in
full; but the coachman calls on all the
saints to witness that he gave the animals
their due, and Frol invokes the Virgin to
confirm the coachmans appeal.
	But father will not be appeased. He
calls in Mak~r, the piano-tuner and sub-
butler, and reminds him of all his re-
cent sins. He was drunk last week, and
must have been drunk yesterday, for he
broke half a dozen plates. In fact, the
breaking of these plates was the real cause
of all the disturbance: our stepmother
had reported the fact to father in the
morning, and that was why Ulidna was
received with more scolding than was
usually the case, why the verification of
the hay was undertaken, and why father
continued to shout that this progeny of
Ham deserved all the punishments on
earth.
	Of a sudden there is a lull in the storm.
My father takes his seat at the table and
writes a note. Take Makar with this
note to the police station, and let a hun-</PB>

dred lashes with the birch rod be given
to him.
	Terror and absolute muteness reign
in the house.
	The clock strikes four, and we all go
down to dinner; but no one has any
appetite, and the soup remains in the
plates untouched. We are ten at table,
and behind each of us a violinist or a
trombone - player stands, with a clean
plate in his left hand; but Maklr is not
among them.
	Where is Mak~r? our stepmother
asks. Call him in.
	Mak~ir does not appear, and the or-
der is repeated. He enters at last, pale,
with a distorted face, ashamed, his eyes
cast down. Father looks into his plate,
while our stepmother, seeing that no one
has touched the soup, tries to encourage
us.
	Dont you find, children, she says,
that the soup is delicious?
	Tears suffocate me, and immediately
after dinner is over I run out, catch
Mak~ir in a dark passage, and try to kiss
his hand; but he tears it away, and says,
either as a reproach or as a question,
Let me alone; and you, too, when you
are grown up, will be just the same?
	No, no, never!
	Yet father was not among the worst of
landowners. On the contrary, the ser-
vants and the peasants considered him
one of the best. What we saw in our
house was going on everywhere, often in
much more cruel forms. The flogging
of the serfs was a regular part of the
duties of the police.

	A landowner once made the remark
to another, Why is it, general, that
the number of your souls increases so
slowly? You probably do not look after
their marriages.
	A few days later the general returned
to his estate. He had a list of all the
inhabitants of his village brought him,
and picked out from it the names of the
boys who had attained the age of cigh
teen, and of the girls just past sixteen, 
these are the legal ages for marriage in
Russia. Then he wrote, John to marry
Anna, Paul to marry Pardshka, and so
on with five couples, and gave orders that
the five weddings should take place in
ten days, the next Sunday but one.
	A general cry of despair rose from
the village. Women, young and old,
wept in every house. Anna had hoped
to marry Gregory; Pauls parents had
already had a talk with the Fed6toffs
about their girl, who would soon be of
age. Moreover, it was the season for
ploughing, not for weddings; and what
wedding can be prepared in ten days?
Dozens of peasants came to see the
landowner; peasant women stood in
groups at the back entrance of the es-
tate, with pieces of fine linen for the
landowners spouse, to secure her inter-
vention. All in vain. The master had
said that the weddings should take place
at such a date, and so it must be.
	At the appointed time, the nuptial
processions, in this case more like burial
processions, went to the church. The
women cried with loud voices, as they
are wont to cry during burials. One of
the house valets was sent to the church,
to report to the master as soon as the
wedding ceremonies were over; but soon
he came running back, cap in hand, pale
and distressed.
	Partishka, he said, makes a stand;
she refuses to be married to Paul. Fa-
ther (that is, the priest) asked her,
Do you agree? but she replied in a
loud voice,  No, I dont.
	The landowner was furious. Go
and tell that long-maned drunkard
(meaning the priest; the Russian clergy
wear their hair long) that if Parashka
is not married at once, I will report him
as a drunkard to the archbishop. How
dares he, clerical dirt, disobey me? Tell
him he shall be sent to rot in a monas-
tery, and I shall exile Par~shkas family
to the steppes.
	The valet transmitted the message.
480</PB>

Panlshkas relatives and the priest sur-
rounded the girl; her mother, weeping,
fell on her knees before her, entreating
her not to ruin the whole family. The
girl continued to say I wont, but in
a weaker and weaker voice, then in a
whisper, until at last she stood silent.
The nuptial crown was put on her head;
she made n~ resistance, and the valet ran
full speed to the mansion to announce,
They are married.
	Half an hour later, the small bells of
the nuptial processions resounded at the
gate of the mansion. The five couples
alighted from the cars and entered the
hall. The landlord received them, of-
fering them glasses of wine, while the
parents, standing behind the crying
daughters, ordered them to bow to the
earth before their lord.
	Marriages by order were so common
that amongst our servants, each time a
young couple foresaw that they might
be ordered to marry, although they had
no mutual inclination for each other,
they took the precaution of standing to-
gether as godfather and godmother at
the christening of a child in one of the
peasant families. This rendered marriage
impossible, according to Russian Church
law. The stratagem was usually suc-
cessful, but once it ended in a tragedy.
Andrei, the tailor, fell in love with a girl
belonging to one of our neighbors. He
hoped that my father would permit him
to go free, as a tailor, in exchange for
a certain yearly payment, and that by
working hard at his trade he could
manage to lay aside some money and to
buy freedom for the girl. Otherwise,
in marrying one of my fathers serfs
she would havc~ become the serf of her
husbands master. However, as Andrei
and one of the maids of our household
foresaw~ that they might be ordered to
marry, they agreed to unite as god-
parents in the christening of a child.
What they had feared happened: one
day they were called to the master, and
the dreaded order was given.
	VOL. LXXXII.  No. 492.	31
	We are always obedient to your
will, they replied, but a few weeks
ago we acted as godfather and god-
mother at a christening. Andrei also
explained his wishes and intentions. The
result was that he was sent to the recruit-
ing board to become a soldier.
	Under Nicholas I. there was no ob-
ligatory military service for all, such as
now exists. Nobles and merchants were
exempt, and when a new levy of re-
cruits was ordered, the landowners had
to supply a certain number of men from
their serfs. As a rule, the peasants, with-
in their village communities, kept a roll
amongst themselves; but the house ser-
vants were entirely at the mercy of their
lord, and if he was dissatisfied with one
of them, he sent him to the recruiting
board and took a recruit acquittance,.
which bad a considerable money value,.
as it could be sold to any one whose turn
it was to become a soldier.
	Military service in those times was
terrible. A man was required to serve
twenty-five years under the colors, and
the life of a soldier was hard in the ex-
treme. To become a soldier meant to be
torn away forever from ones native vil-
lage and surroundings, and to be at the
mercy of officers like Timof6eff, whom
I have already mentioned. Blows from
the officers, flogging with birch rods
and with sticks, for the slightest fault,
were normal affairs. The cruelty that
was displayed surpasses all imagination.
Even in the corps of cadets, where only
noblemens sons were educated, a thou-
sand blows with birch rods were some-
times administered, in the presence of all
the corps, for a cigarette,  the doctor
standing by the tortured boy, and order-
ing the punishment to end only when he
ascertained that the pulse was about to
stop beating. The bleeding victim was
carried away unconscious to the hospital.
The Grand Duke Mikhael, commander
of the military schools, would quickly
have removed the director of a corps
who had not had one or two such cases</PB>

every year. No discipline, he used to
say.
	When one of the common soldiers ap-
peared before a court-martial, the sen-
tence was that a thousand men should
be placed in two ranks facing each other,
every soldier armed with a stick of the
thickness of the little finger (these sticks
were known under their German name
of Spitzruthen) ,and that the condemned
man should be dragged three, four, five,
and seven times between these two rows,
each soldier administering a blow. Ser-
geants followed to see that full force
was used. After one or two thousand
blows had been given, the victim, spit-
ting blood, was taken to the hospital
and attended to, in order that the pun-
ishment might be finished as soon as
he had more or less recovered from the
effects of the first part of it. If he
died under the torture, the execution of
the sentence was completed upon the
corpse. Nicholas I. and his brother
were pitiless; no remittance of the pun-
ishment was ever possible. I will send
you through the ranks; you shall be
skinned under the sticks, were threats
which made part of the current lan-
guage.
	A gloomy terror used to spread
through our house when it became known
that one of the servants was to be sent
to the recruiting board. The man was
chained and pl~iced under guard in the
office. A peasant-cart was brought to
the office door, and the doomed man
was taken out between two watchmen.
All the servants surrounded him. He
made a deep bow, asking every one to
pardon him his willing or unwilling of-
fenses. If his father and mother lived
in our village, they came to see him off.
He bowed to the ground before them,
and his mother and his other female re-
latives began loudly to give utterance to
their lamentations,  a sort of half-song
and half-recitative: To whom do you
abandon us? Who will take care of
you in the strange lands? Who will
protect you from cruel men?  exact-
ly in the same way in which they sang
their lamentations at a burial, and with
the same words.
	Thus Andrei had now to face for
twenty-five years the terrible fate of a
soldier: all his schemes of happiness
had come to a violent end.

	The fate of one of the maids, Paul-
ine, or P6lya, as she used to be called,
was even more tragical. She had been
apprenticed to make fine embroidery,
and was an artist at the work. At Ni-
k6lskoye her embroidery frame stood in
sister H6l~nes room, and she often took
part in the conversations that went on
between our sister and a sister of our
stepmother who stayed with H6li~ne.
Altogether, by her behavior and talk
P6lya was more like an educated young
person than a housemaid.
	A misfortune befell her: she realized
that she would soon be a mother. She
told all to our stepmother, who burst
into reproaches: I will not have that
creature in my house any longer! I will
not permit such a shame in my house!
oh, the shameless creature! and so on.
The tears of H6llme made no difference.
P6lya had her hair cut short, and was ex-
iled to the dairy; but as she was just em-
broidering an extraordinary skirt, she
had to finish it at the dairy, in a dirty
cottage, at a microscopical window. She
finished it, and made many more fine
embroideries, all in the hope of obtain-
ing her pardon. But pardon did not
come.
	The father of her child, a servant of
one of our neighbors, implored permis-
sion to marry her; but as he had no
money to offer, his request was refused.
P6lyas too gentlewoman-like man-
ners were taken as an offense, and a
most bitter fate was kept in reserve for
her. There was in our household a man
employed as a postilion, on account of
his small size; he went under the name
of bandy-legged Filka. In his boyhood</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00489" SEQ="0489" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="483">	The Autobiography of a Revolutionist.	483

a horse had kicked him terribly, and he
did not grow. His legs were crooked,
his feet were turned inward, his nose
was broken and turned to one side, his
jaw was deformed. To this monster it
was decided to marry P6lya,  and she
was married by force. The couple were
sent to become peasants at my fathers
estate in Ryazan.
	Human feelings were not recognized,
not even suspected, in serfs, and when
Turgu6neff published his little story
Mumu, and Grigor6vich began to issue
his wonderful novels, in which he made
his readers weep over the misfortunes
of the serfs, a great number of persons
received a startling revelation. They
love just as we do; is it possible? ex-
claimed the sentimental ladies who could
not read a French novel without shed-
ding tears over the troubles of the noble
heroes and heroines.

	The education which the owners occa-
sionally gave to some of their serfs was
only another source of misfortune for
the latter. My father once picked out
in a peasant house a clever boy, and sent
him to be educated as a doctors assis-
tant. The boy was diligent, and after
a few years apprenticeship made a de-
cided success. When he returned home,
my father bought all that was required
for a well-equipped dispensary, which
was arranged very nicely in one of the
side houses of Nik6lskoye. In summer
time, Siisha the Doctor  that was the
familiar name under which this young
man went in the household  was busy
gathering and preparing all sorts of
medical herbs, and in a short time he
became most popular in the region
round Nik6lskoye. The sick people
among the peasants came from the neigh-
boring villages, and my father was proud
of the success of his dispensary. But
this condition of things did not last.
One winter, my father came to Nik6l-
skoye, stayed there for a few days, and
left. That night S~sha the Doctor shot
himself,  by accident, it was reported;
but there was a love-story at the bottom
of it. He was in love with a girl whom
he could not marry, as she belonged to
another landowner.
	The case of another young man, Ghe-
rdsim Krugl6ff, whom my father educat-
ed at the Moscow Agricultural Institute,
was almost equally sad. He passed his
examinations most brilliantly, getting a
gold medal, and the director of the In-
stitute made all possible endeavors to
induce my father to give him freedom
and to let him go to the university, 
serfs not being allowed to enter there.
He is sure to become a remarkable
man, the director said, perhaps one
of th6 glories of Russia, and it will be
an honor for you to have recognized his
capacities and to have given such a man
to Russian science.
	I need him for my own estate, my
father always replied to the many appli-
cations made on the young mans behalf.
In reality, with the primitive methods
of agriculture which were then in use,
and from which my father would never
have departed, Gheri~sim Krugl6ff was
absolutely useless. He made a survey of
the estate, but when that was done he
was ordered to sit in the servants room
and to stand with a plate at dinner-time.
Of course Gher~sim resented it very
much; his dreams carried him to the
university, to scientific work. His looks
betrayed his discontent, and my step-
mother seemed to find an especial plea-
sure in offending him at every oppor-
tunity. One day in the autumn, a rush
of wind having opened the entrance gate,
she called out to him, Gari~ska, go and
shut the gate.
	That was the last drop. He answered,
You have a porter for that, and went
his way.
	My stepmother ran into fathers room,
crying, Your servants insult me in your
house!
	Immediately Gberi~sim was put under
arrest and chained, to be sent away as a</PB>

soldier. The parting of his old father
and mother with him was one of the
most heart-rending scenes I ever saw.
	This time, however, fate took its re-
venge. Nicholas I. died, and military
service became more tolerable. Gher~i-
sims great ability was soon remarked,
and in a few years he was one of the
chief clerks, and the real working force
in one of the departments of the min-
istry of war. Meanwhile, my father,
who was absolutely honest, and, at a
time when almost every one was receiv-
ing bribes and making fortunes, had
never let himself be bribed to depart
from the strict rules of the service, in
order to oblige the commander of the
corps to which he belonged, consented
to allow an irregularity of some kind.
It nearly cost him his promotion to the
rank of general; the only object of his
thirty-five years service in the army
seemed on the point of being lost. My
stepmother went to St. Petersburg to
remove the difficulty, and one day after
many applications, was told that the only
way, to obtain what she wanted was to
address herself to a particular clerk in a
certain department of the ministry. Al-
though he was a mere clerk, he was the
real head of his superiors, and could do
everything. This mans name was Ghe-
rasim Ivanovich Krugl6ff!
	Imagine, our Garlska! she said
to me afterward. I always knew that
he had great capacity. I went to see
him, and spoke to him about this affair,
and he said, I have nothing against the
oid prince, and I will do all I can for
him.
	Gher~lsim kept his word: he made a
favorable report, and my father got his
promotion. At last he could put on the
long-coveted red trousers and the red-
lined overcoat, and could wear the plum-
age on his helmet.
	These were things which I myself saw
in my childhood. If, however, I were
to relate what I heard of in those years
it would be a much more gruesome nar
rative: stories of men and women torn
from their families and their villages,
and sold, or lost in gambling, or ex-
changed for a couple of hunting dogs,
and then transported to some remote
part of Russia for the sake of creating a
new estate; of children taken from their
parents and sold to cruel or dissolute
masters; of flogging in the stables,
which occurred every day with unheard-
of cruelty; of a girl who found her
only salvation in drowning herself; of
an old man who had grown gray-haired
in his masters service, and at last
hanged himself under his masters win-
dow; and of revolts of serfs, which were
suppressed by Nicholas I.s generals by
flogging to death each tenth or fifth man
taken out of the ranks, and by laying
waste the village, whose inhabitants, after
a military execution, went begging for
bread in the neighboring provinces. As
to the poverty which I saw during our
journeys in certain villages, especially
in those which belonged to the imperial
family, no words would be adequate to
describe the misery to readers who have
not seen it.

	To become free was the constant
dream of the serfs,  a dream not easily
realized, for a heavy sum of money was
required to induce a landowner to part
with a serf. Do you know, my fa-
ther said to me once, that your mother
appeared to me after her death? You
young people do not believe in these
things, but it was so. I sat one night
very late in this chair, at my writing-ta-
ble, and slumbered, when I saw her en-
ter from behind, all in white, quite pale,
and with her eyes gleaming. When she
was dying she begged me to promise that
I would give liberty to her maid, M~isha,
and I did promise; but then, what with
one thing and another, nearly a whole
year passed without my having fulfilled
my intention. Then she appeared, and
said. to me in a low voice, Alexis, you
promised me to give liberty to M~isha;</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00491" SEQ="0491" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="485">	The Autobiography of a Revolutionist.	485

have you forgotten it? I was quite ter-
rified; I jumped out of my chair, but she
had vanished. I called the servants, but
no one had seen anything. Next morn-
ing I went to her grave and had a litany
sung, and immediately gave liberty to
MLisha.
	When my father died, M~sha came
to his burial, and I spoke to her. She
was married, and quite happy in her
family life. My brother Alexander, in
his jocose way, told her what my father
had said, and we asked her what she
knew of it.
	These things, she replied, hap-
pened a long time ago, so I may tell you
the truth. I saw that your Tather had
quite forgotten his promise, so I dressed
up in white and spoke like your mother.
I recalled the promise he had made to
her,~ you wont bear a grudge against
me, will you?
	Of course not!

	Ten or twelve years after the scenes
described in the early part of this chap-
ter, I sat one night in my fathers room,
and we talked of things past. Serfdom
had been abolished, and my father com-
plained of the new conditions, though not
very severely; he had accepted them
without much grumbling.
	You must agree, father, I said,
that you often punished your servants
cruelly, and even without reason.
	With the people, he replied, it
was impossible to do otherwise; and,
leaning back in his easy-chair, he re-
mained plunged in thought. But what
I did was nothing worth speaking of,
he said after a long pause. Take that
same Sablin: he looks so soft, and talks
in such a thin voice; but he was really
terrible with his serfs. How many
times they plotted to kill him! I, at
least, never took advantage of my maids,
whereas that old devil T went on in
such a way that the peasant women were
going to inflict a terrible punishment
upon him. . . . Good-by, bonne nuit!
Ix.

	I well remember the Crimean war.
At Moscow it affected people but little.
Of course, in every house lint and ban-
dages for the wounded were made at
evening parties: not much of it, how-
ever, reached the Russian armies, im-
mense quantities being stolen and sold
abroad. My sister H61&#38; ne and other
young ladies sang patriotic songs, but
the general tone of life in society was
hardly influenced by the great struggle
that was going on. In the country, on
the contrary, the war caused terrible
gloominess. The levies of recruits fol-
lowed one another rapidly, and we con-
tinually heard the peasant women sing-
ing their funereal songs. The Russian
people looked upon the war as a calam-
ity which had been sent upon theni by
Providence, and they accepted it with a
solemnity that contrasted strangely with
the levity I saw elsewhere under similar
circumstances. Young though I was, I
realized that feeling of solemn resigna-
tion which pervaded our villages.
	My brother Nicholas was smitten like
many others by the war fever, and be-
fore he had ended his course at the corps
he joined the army in the Caucasus. I
never saw him again.
	In the autumn of 1854 our family was
increased by the arrival of two sisters
of our stepmother. They had had their
own house and some vineyards at Sebas-
topol, but now they were homeless, and
came to stay with us. When the allies
landed in the Crimea, the inhabitants of
Sebastopol were told that they need not
be afraid, and had only to stay where
they were; but after the defeat at the
Alma, they were ordered to leave with
all haste, as the city would be invested
within a few days. There were few con-
veyances, and there was no way of mov-
ing along the roads in face of the troops
which were marching southward. To
hire a cart was almost impossible, and
the ladies, having abandoned all they had</PB>

on the road, had a very hard time of it
before they reached Moscow.
	I soon made friends with the younger
of the two sisters, a lady of about thir-
ty, who used to smoke one cigarette af-
ter another, and to tell me of all the
horrors of their journey. She spoke
with tears in her eyes of the beautiful
battle-ships which had to be sunk at the
entrance of the harbor of Sebastopol,
and could not understand how the Rus-
sians would manage to defend Sebasto-
p01 from the land; there was even no
wall worth speaking of.
	I was in my thirteenth year when
Nicholas I. died. It was late in the af-
ternoon, the 18th of February (2d of
March), that the policemen distributed
in all the houses of Moscow a bulletin
announcing the illness of the Tsar, and
inviting the inhabitants to pray in the
churches for his recovery. At that time
he was already dead, and the authorities
knew it, as there was telegraphic com-
munication between Moscow and St. Pe-
tersburg; but not a word having been
previously uttered about his illness, the
people were in this way gradually pre-
pared for the announcement of his death.
We all went to church and prayed most
piously.
	Next day, Saturday, the same thing
was done, and even on Sunday morning
bulletins about the Tsars health were
distributed. The news of the death of
Nicholas reached us only about midday,
through some servants who had been to
the market. A real terror reigned in
our house and in the houses of our rela-
tives, as the information spread. It was
said that the people in the market be-
haved in a strange way, showing no re-
gret, but indulging in dangerous talk.
Full-grown people spoke in whispers, and
our stepmother kept repeating, Dont
talk before the men; while the servants
whispered among themselves, probably
about the coming freedom. The no-
bles expected at every moment a revolt of
the serfs,  a new uprising of Pugach6ff~
	At St. Petersburg, in the meantime,
men of the educated classes, as they
communicated to one another the news,
embraced in the streets. Every one felt
that the end of the war and the end of
the terrible conditions which prevailed
under the iron despot were near at
hand. Poisoning was talked about, the
more so as the Tsars body decomposed
very rapidly, but the true reason only
gradually leaked out: a too strong dose
of an invigorating medicine that Nicho-
las had taken.
	In the country, during the summer of
1855, the heroic struggle which was go-
ing on in Sebastopol for every yard of
ground and every bit of its dismantled
bastions was followed with a solemn in-
terest. A messenger was sent regularly
twice a week from our house to the dis-
trict town to get the papers; and on his
return, even before he had dismounted,
the papers were taken from his hands
and opened. H~lime or I read them
aloud to the family, and the news was
at once transmitted to the servants
room, and thence to the kitchen, the of-
fice, the priests house, and the houses
of the peasants. The reports which
came of the last days of Sebastopol, of
the awful bombardment, and finally of
the evacuation of the town by our troops
were received with tears. In every
country house round about, the loss of
Sebastopol was mourned over with as
much grief as the loss of a near relative
would have been, although every one un-
derstood that now the terrible war would
soon come to an end.

	It was in August, 1857, when I was
nearly fifteen, that my turn came to en-
ter the corps of pages, and I was taken
to St. Petersburg. When I left home I
was still a child; but human character
is usually settled in a definite way at an
earlier age than is generally supposed,
and it is evident to me that under my
childish appearance I was then very</PB>

much what I was to be later on. My
tastes, my inclinations, were already de-
termined.
	The first impulse to my intellectual
development was given, as I have said,
by my Russian teacher. It is an excel-
lent habit in Russian families  a habit
now, unhappily, on the decline  to have
such a teacher in the house; that is, a
student who aids the boys and the girls
with their lessons, even when they are
at a gymnasium. For a better assimila~
tion of what they learn at school, and
for a widening of their conceptions about
what they learn, his aid is invaluable.
Moreover, he introduces an intellectual
element into the family, and becomes
an elder brother to the young people, 
often something better than an elder
brother, because the student has a cer-
tain responsibility for the progress of his
pupils; and as the methods of teaching
change rapidly, from one generation to
another, he can assist his pupils better
than the best educated parents could.
	Smirn6ff had literary tastes. A.t that
time, under the terrible censorship of
Nicholas I., many quite inoffensive works
by our best writers could not be pub-
lished; others were so mutilated as to
deprive some passages in. theni of any
meaning. In the genial comedy by Gri-
boy6doff, Misfortune from Intelligence,
which ranks with the best comedies of
Moli~re, Colonel Skaloziib had to be
named Mr. Skaloziib, to the detriment
of the sense and even of the verses; for
the representation of a colonel in a com-
ical light would have been considered an
insult to the army. Of so innocent a
book as G6gols Dead Souls the second
part was not allowed to appear, nor the
first part to be reprinted, although it had
long been out of print. Numerous verses
of Pdshkin, L6rmontoff, A. K. Tolst6i,
Ryl&#38; ff, and other poets were not per-
mitted to see the light; to say nothing
of such verses as had any political mean-
ing or contained a criticism of the pre-
vailing conditions. All these circulated
in manuscript, and Smirn6ff used to copy
whole books of G6gol and Piishkin for
himself and his friends to use, a task in
which I occasionally helped him. As a
true child of Moscow he was also im-
bued with the deepest veneration for
those of our writers who lived in Mos-
cow,  some of them in the Old Equer-
ries Quarter. He pointed out to me with
respect the house of the Countess Salihs
(Eug~nie Tour), who was our near neigh-
bor, while the house of the noted exile
Alexander H6rzen always was associated
with a certain mysterious feeling. The
house where G6gol lived was for us an
object of deep respect, and though I was
not nine when he died (in 1851), and
had read none of his works, I remember
well the sadness his death produced at
Moscow. Turgu6neff well expressed that
feeling in a note, for which Nicholas I.
 no one could say why  ordered him
to be put under arrest and sent into
exile to his estate.
	Piishkins great poem, Evgh6niy On-
y~ghin, made but little impression upon
me, and I still admire the marvelous
simplicity and beauty of his style in that
poem more than its contents. But G6-
gols works, which I read when I was
eleven or twelve, had a powerful effect
on my mind, and my first literary es-
says were in imiUation of his humorous
manner. An historical novel by Zag6-
skin, Yuriy Milosh~vskiy, about the times
of the great uprising of 1612, Pdsh-
kins The Captains Daughter, dealing
with the Pugach6ff uprising, and Dumas
Queen Marguerite awakened in me a
lasting interest in history. As to other
French novels, I have only begun to read
them since Daudet and Zola came to the
front. Nekr~soffs poetry was my favor-
ite from early years; I knew many of his
verses by heart.
	NikolAi P~vlovich early began to make
me write, and with his aid I wrote a
long History of a Sixpence, for which
we invented all sorts of characters, into
whose possession the sixpence felL My</PB>

brother Alexander had at that time a
much more poetical turn of mind. He
wrote most romantic stories, and early
made verses. The latter, which he com-
posed with wonderful facility, were most
musical and easy; and if his mind had
not subsequently been taken up by nat-
ural history and philosophical studies, he
undoubtedly would have become a poet
of mark. In those years his favorite re-
sort for finding poetical inspiration was
the gently sloping roof underneath our
window. This aroused in me a constant
desire of teasing him. There is the
poet sitting under the chimney-pot, try-
ing to write his verses, I used to say;
and the teasing ended in a fierce scrim-
mage, which brought our sister H6l~ne to
a state of despair~ But Alexander was
so devoid of revengefulness that peace
was soon concluded, and we loved each
other immensely. Among boys, scrim-
mage and love seem to go hand in hand.
	I had even then taken to journalism.
In my twelfth year I began to edit a
daily. Paper was not to be had at will
in our house, and my daily was in 32~
only. As the Crimean war had not yet
broken out, and the only paper which my
father used to receive was the Gazette
of the Moscow Police, I had not a great
choice of models. As a result my own
Gazette consisted merely of short para-
graphs announcing the news of the day:
as, Went out to the woods. N. P.
Smirn6ff shot two thrushes, and so on.
	This soon ceased to satisfy me, and in
1855 I started a monthly review in 160,
which contained Alexanders verses, my
novelettes, and some sort of varieties.
The material existence of this review
was fully guaranteed, for it had plenty
of subscribers; that is, the editor himself
and Smirn6ff, who regularly paid his
subscription, of so many sheets of paper,
even after he had left our house. In re-
turh, I accurately wrote out for my faith-
ful subscriber a second copy.
	When Smirn6ff left us, and a student
of medicine, N. M. Ptivloff, took his
place, the latter helped me in my edito-
rial duties. He obtained for the review
a poem by one of his friends, and still
more important  the introductory lec~
ture on physical geography by one of the
Moscow professors. Of course this had
not been printed before: a reproduction
would never have found its way into the
review.
	Alexander, I need not say, took a
lively interest in the paper, and its fame
soon reached the corps of cadets. Some
young writers on the way to fame nn~
dertook the publication of a rival. The
matter was serious: in poems and novels
we could hold our own; but they had a
critic, and a  critic  who writes, in
connection with the characters of some
new novel, all sorts of things about the
conditions of life, and touches upon a
thousand questions which could not be
touched upon anywhere else, makes the
soul of a Russian review. They had a
critic, and we had none! He wrote an
article for the first number; and his ar-
ticle, rather pretentious and weak, was
shown to my brother. Alexander at
once wrote an anti-criticism, ridiculing
and demolishing the critic in such a vio-
lent manner that when he showed his ar-
ticle to his comrades, saying that it would
appear in our next number, there was
great consternation in the rival camp.
The result was that they gave up publish-
ing their paper, their best writers joined
our staff, and we triumphantly announced
the future exclusive collaboration of so
many distinguished writers.
	In August, 1857, the review had to
be suspended, after nearly two years ex-
istence. New surroundings and a quite
new life were before me. I went away
from home with regret, the more so be-
cause the whole distance between Mos-
cow and St. Petersburg would be between
me and Alexander, and I already consid-
ered it a misfortune that I had to enter a
military school.

	I D rather do anything than to
pack, said a North Carolina mountain
man. His tone bespoke a fullness of
experience; as if a farm-bred Yankee
were to say, I d rather do anything
than to pick stones in cold weather.
He had found me talking with a third
man by the wayside on a sultry forenoon.
The third man carried a bag of corn
on his back, and was on his way from
Horse Cove to Highlands (valleys are
coves in that part of the South), up the
long steep mountain side down which,
with frequent stops for admiration of
the world below, I had been lazily tra-
veling. He was sick, he told me; and as
his appearance corroborated his words,
I had been trying to persuade him to
leave his load where it was, trust its safe-
ty to Providence, and go home. Just
then it happened that mountaineer num-
ber two came along and delivered him-
self as above quoted.
	He was going to Highlands, also.
He had been putting in a week try-
ing to buy a cow to replace one that
had mired herself and broken her neck.
I would rather have paid down twen-
ty-five dollars in gold, he declared.
(The air was full of political silver talk;
but gold is the standard, after all, when
men come to business.) He knew the
invalid, it appeared; for presently he
turned into a trail, a short cut through
the woods, which till now had escaped
my notice, and remarked, Well, John,
I guess I 11 take the narrow way; and
off he went up the slope, while the other
man and I continued our dialogue,  I

Wiseman, and Christian still uncon-
vinced, but not indisposed to parley.

from; and when I told him, he said,

right hot down there now. He held
the common belief of the mountain peG.
pie that the rest of the earths sur-
face is mostly uninhabitable in summer-
time. One morning, I remember, I
said something to an idler on the village
sidewalk about the cool night we had
just passed. I meant my little speech
as a kind of local compliment, but he
took me up at once. It was pretty hot,
he thought,  about as hot a night as
he ever knew. He did nt see how folks
hoed down in Charleston; and I partly
agreed with him. He had been borned
right here, and had never been farther
away than to Seneca; and from his
manner of expressing himself I inferred
that he hoped never to find himself so
far from home again. This was in the
midst of a heated term, when the
mercury, at four oclock in the after-
noon, registered 740 on the hotel piazza.

BIRDS, FLOWERS, AND PEOPLE.

men, women, and children, as I fell in
with them out of doors here and there,
in the course of my daily perambula-
tions. Poverty-cursed as they looked
(the universal packing by both sexes
over those up-and-down roads, and the
shiftless, comfortless appearance of the
cabins, were proof enough of a pinched
estate), they seemed to be laudably in-
dustrious, and, as the world goes, enjoy-
ers of life. If they said little, it was
perhaps rather my fault than theirs (the
key must fit the lock), and certainly they
treated me with nothing but kindness.
	More than a fortnight after my inter-
view with the invalid, just described, I
was returning to the hotel from an ear-
ly morning jaunt down the Walballa
road, when I met a man driving a pair
of dwarfish steers hitched to a pair of
wheels, on the axle - tree of which was
fastened a rude, widely ventilated, home-
made box, with an odd - shaped, home-
made basket hung on one side of it, 
the driver, literally, on the box. I greet-
ed him, and he pulled up. Well, I
see you are still here, he said, after
a good-morning. You have seen me
before? I replied. He was sallow and
thin,  the usual mountaineers condi-
tion,  but wore the pleasantest of smiles.
Yes; I saw you down in the Cove with
the sick man. He was the pilgrim who
took the narrow way, and was hunt-
ing for a cow, though I should not have
remembered him. And now, peeping
through one of the holes in the box, I
saw that he had a calf inside. A Jer-
sey ? asked I. Part Jersey, he an-
swered. Mr. S (one of the villa-
gers, whom by this time I counted as a
friend, a white-haired, youngish veteran
of the civil war, on the Union side, a
neighbor I had taken to from the
moment I saw him), Mr. 5 had
given the calf to the mans father-in-law,
and he, the son-in-law, had driven up to
the village to fetch it home. He lived
about six miles out, on a side road. I
inquired about the two or three houses
in sight in the valley clearing below us.
It was the Webb settlement, he told
me; so we always call it. I remarked
that all hands seemed to have plenty of
children. Yes, plenty of children, he
responded, with a laugh; and away he
drove.
	It was only a few minutes before an-
other man appeared, a foot passenger
this time, walking at a smart pace, with
an umbrella on his shoulder, and a new
pair of boots slung across it. You
travel faster than I do, said I. Yes,
sir, he answered, smiling (all men like
the name of being active), I go pret-
ty peart when I go. He, too, had six
miles before him, and believed it would
begin to rain after a bit. It would
have been an imposition upon good na-
ture to detain him. There was a bend
in the road just below, and in another
minute I heard him spanking round it
at a lively trot.
	Five minutes more, and a second pe-
destrian hove in sight. He, likewise,
was in haste. You are all in a hurry
to-day, I said to him. I was in pur-
suit of acquaintance, and in such places
it is the part of wisdom, and of good
manners as well, to make the most of
chance opportunities. Yes, sir, lie
made answer, slackening his pace; I
want to get my road done. I ye got till
Saturday, and I want to get it done;
and he put on steam again, and was
gone. His countenance was familiar, but
I could not tell where I had seen him,
 one of the fathers of the Webb set-
tlement, perhaps. The mountaineers,
all thin, all light-complexioned, and all
wearing the same drab homespun, look
confusingly alike to a newcomer. Who-
ever the stranger was, he had evident-
ly undertaken to build some part of the
new road, and was returning from the
village with supplies. In one hand he
carried two heavy drills, and under the
other arm a strip of pork, a piece of
brown paper wrapped about the middle
of it, and the long ends dangling. It</PB>

did my vacationers heart good to see
men so cheerfully industrious; but I
thought it a reproach to the order of
the world that so much hard work should
yield so little of comfort. But then,
who knows which was the more comfort-
able,  the idle, criticising tourist or the
sweating laborer? For the time being,
at all events, the laborer had the air of
a person inwardly well off. A moun-
tain man with a contract was not
likely to be envious even of a boarder at
Mrs. Daviss, as the hotel is locally,
and very properly, called.
	As I went on, passing the height of
land and beginning my descent home-
ward, I met two other foot passengers, 
two women: one old and fat,  the only
fat mountaineer of either sex seen in
North Carolina,  with a red face and a
staff; the other young, slightly built and
pale, carrying an old-fashioned shotgun
(the ramrod projecting) over her right
shoulder. Both wore sunbonnets, and
the younger had a braid of hair hanging
down her back. With her slender fig-
ure, her colorless face, her serious look,
and the long musket, she would have
made a subject for a painter. This
pair I could think of no excuse for ac-
costing, much as I should have enjoyed
hearing them talk. Shortly after they
had gone, I stopped to speak with a
small boy who was climbing the hill, with
a mewing kitten hugged tightly to his
breast. He was taking it home to his cat,
he said. She brought in mice and things,
and wanted something to give them to.
The little fellow was still young enough
to understand the mother instinct.
	That was a truly social walk. I had
never before found one of those moun-
tarn roads half so populous. Once, in-
deed, I drove all day without seeing a
passenger of any sort, until, near the end

	On a different road, and on a Sunday
morning, I met a young colored woman,  an
unusual sight, colored people being personce
non grata3 in the mountains. We bade each
other good-morning, as Christians should. My
of the afternoon and within a mile or two
of the town, I met a solitary horseman.
	The new road, of which I have spoken,
and concerning which I heard so much
said on all hands, was really not quite
that, but rather a new laying out  with
loops here and there to avoid the steeper
pitches  of the road from Walballa,
over which I had driven on my entrance
into the mountains. My friend Mr. S
had made the surveys for the work,
and the whole town was looking forward
eagerly to its completion. Toward sun-
set, on a Sunday afternoon, I had been
out of the village in an opposite direc-
tion, and was sitting by the wayside in
the Stewart woods, full of flowers and
music, where I loved often to linger,
when three men approached on foot.
How far have you come? I inquired.
From Franklin,  about twenty miles
distant,  they answered. They were
going to work on the new road up at
Stooly (Satulah Mountain), or so I un-
derstood the oldest of the trio, who acted
throughout as spokesman. (In my part
of the country it is only the profession-
ally idle who walk twenty miles at a
stretch.) Well, said I, none too po-
litely, being nothing but an outsider, I
hope you 11 make it better than it was
when I came up. He replied, quite
good-humoredly, that they were making
a good road of it this time. And so they
were, comparatively speaking; for I went
over the mountain one day on purpose
to see it, after I krew who had laid it
out, and had begun to feel a personal in-
terest in its success. One of the, men
carried a hoe, and one a small tin clock.
They had no other baggage, I think.
When a man works on the road, he needs
a hoe to work with, and a timepiece to
tell him when to begin and when to

I am bound to add that these workmen
seemed to be going to their task as if it
were a privilege. It eases labor to feel
that one is doing a good job. That
makes the difference, so ~ve used to be
told, by Carlyle or some one else, be-
tween an artist and an artisan; and I
see no reason why such encouraging dis-
tinctions should not apply to road-mend-
ers as well as to menders of philosophy.
There is no such thing as drudgery, even
for a man with a hoe, so long as quality
is the end in view.
	Whatever else was to be said of the
roads hereabout,  and the question is of
paramount importance in such a country,
where mails and supplies must be trans-
ported thirty miles (a two days jour-
ney for loaded wagons),  they were al-
most ideally perfect from a walking
naturalists point of view; neither sandy
nor muddy, the two evils of Southern
roads in general, and conducting the
traveler at once into wild and shady
places. The village is closely built, and
no matter in which direction I turned,
the houses were quickly behind me, and
I was as truly in the woods as if I had
made a days march from civilization.
A straggling town, with miles of outly-
ing farms and pasture lands, through the
sunny stretches of which a man must
make his way forenoon and afternoon,
is a state of things at once so usual and
so disheartening that the point may well
be among the earliest to be considered
in planning a Southern vacation.
	In a new country an ornithologist
thinks first of all of the birds peculiar
to it, if any such there are; and I was
no sooner off the hotel piazza for my first
ante-breakfast stroll at Highlands than
I was on the watch for Carolina snow-
birds and mountain solitary vireos, two
varieties ( subspecies is the more mod-
ern word) originally described a few years
ago, by Mr. Brewster, from specimens

~	The Auk, vol. iii. pp. 108 and 111.
	2 My first impression was correct. Mr. Brews-
ter, as I now notice, says of the nest that it is
taken at this very place. I had gone
perhaps a quarter of a mile over the road
by which I had driven into the town,
after dark, on the evening before, when
I was conscious that a bird had flown out
from under the overhanging bank just
behind me. I turned hastily, and on the
instant put my eye npon the nest. My
ear, as it happened, had marked the spot
precisely. Here it is, I thought, and
in a fraction of a minute more the anxious
mother showed herself,  a snowbird.
The nest looked somewhat larger than
those I had seen in New Hampshire, but
that may have been a fault of memory.2
It contained young birds and a single
egg. I was in great luck, I said to my-
self; but in truth, as a longer experience
showed, the birds were so numerous all
about me that it would have been no
very difficult undertaking to find a nest
or two almost any day.
	Birds which had been isolated (se-
parated from the parent stock) long
enough to have taken on some constant
physical peculiarity  without which
they could not be entitled to a distinc-
tive name, though it were only a third
one  might be presumed to have ac-
quired at the same time some slight but
real idiosyncrasy of voice and language.
But if this is true of the Carolina junco,
I failed to satisfy myself of the fact.
On the first day, indeed, I wrote with
perfect confidence, The song is clear-
ly distinguishable from that of the north-
ern bird,  less musical, more woodeny
and chippery; more like the chipping
sparrows, I meant to say. If I had
come away then, with one birds trill to
go upon, that would have been my ver-
dict, to be printed, when the time came,
without misgiving. But further obser-
vation brought further light, or, if the
reader will, further obscurity. Some in-
dividuals were better singers than oth-
ers,  so much was to be expected; but

larger and composed of coarser material
than that of Junco kyemalis.</PB>

taking them together, their music was
that of ordinary snowbirds such as I had
always listened to. For aught my ears
told me, I might have been in Fran-
conia. This is not to assert that the
Alleghanian junco has not developed a
voice in some measure its own; I believe
it has; probability has more authority
than personal experience with me in mat-
ters of this kind; but the change is as
yet too inconsiderable for my senses to
appreciate on a short acquaintance, with
no opportunity for a direct comparison.
In such cases, it is perhaps true that one
needs to trust the first lively impression,
 which has, undeniably, its own pecu-
liar value,  or to wait the result of ab-
solute familiarity. My stay of three
weeks gave me neither one thing nor
another; it was long enough to dissipate
my first feeling of certainty, but not
long enough to yield a revised and set-
tled judgment.
	The mountain vireo ( Vireo solitarius
alticol~), like the Carolina snowbird,
may properly be called a native of High-
lands; and, like the snowbird, it proved
to be common. My first sight of it was
in the hotel yard, but I found it  sin-
gle pairs  everywhere. A look at the
feathers of the back through an opera-
glass showed at once the principal dis-
tinction  apart from a superiority in
size, not perceptible at a distance  on
which its subspecific identity is based;
but though to its original describer its
song sounded very much finer than the
northern birds, I could not bring myself
to the same conclusion. I should never
have remarked in it anything out of the
common. Once, to be sure, I heard notes
which led me to say, There! that voice
is more like a yellow-throats,  fuller
and rounder than a typical solitarys;
but that might have happened anywhere,
and at all other times, although I had the
point continually in mind, I could only
pronounce the song to be exactly what
my ear was accustomed to,  sweet and
everything that was beautiful, but a soli

tary vireos song, and nothing else. And
this, to my thinking, is praise enough.
There is no bird - song within my ac-
quaintance that excels the solitarys in a
certain intimate expressiveness, affection-
ateness, home-felt happiness, and purity.
Not that it has all imaginable excellen-
cies,  the unearthly, spiritual quality of
the best of our woodland thrush music,
for example; but such as it is, an utter-
ance of love and loves felicity, it leaves
nothing to ask for. What a contrast be-
tween it and the red-eyes comparatively
meaningless and feelingless music! And
yet, so far as mere form is concerned,
the two songs may be considered as built
upon the same model, if not variations
of the same theme. There must be a
world-wide difference between the two
species, one would say, in the matter of
character and temperament.
	My arrival at Highlands seemed to
have been coincident with that of an ex-
traordinary throng of rose-breasted gros-
beaks. For the first few days, especial-
ly, the whole countryside was alive with
them, till I felt as if I had never seen
grosbeaks before. Their warbling was
incessant; so incessant, and at the same
time so exceedingly smooth and sweet, 
mellifluous is precisely the word, 
that I welcomed it almost as a relief when
the greater part of the chorus moved on.
After such a surfeit of honeyed fluency,
I was prepared better than ever to ap-
preciate certain of our humbler musi-
cians,  with a touch of roughness in the
voice and something of brokenness in
the tune; birds, for instance, like the
black-throated green warbler, the yellow-
throated vireo, and the scarlet tanager.
But if I was glad the crowd had gone,
I was glad also that a goodly sprinkling
of the birds had remained; so that there
was never a day when I did not see and
hear them. The rose-breast is a lovely
singer. In my criticism of him I am to
be understood as meaning no more than
this: that he, like every other artist, has
the defects of his good qualities. Smooth-

ness is a virtue in music as in writing;
but it is not the only virtue, nor the one
that wears longest.
	After the grosbeaks, whose great abun-
dance was but transitory, two of the
most numerous birds were the Canadi-
an flycatching warbler and the black-
throated blue,  two Northerners, as I
had always thought of them. Every
mountain stream was overhung, mile
after mile, by a tangle of rhododendron
and laurel, and out of every such tangle
came the hoarse, drawling kree, kree,
kree of the black-throated blue, and the
sharp, vivacioLis, haif-wrennish song of
the Canadian flycatcher. I had never
seen either species in anything near such
numbers; and I may include the Black-
burnian warbler in the same statement.
Concerning the black-throated blue, it is
to be said that within a year or two the
Alleghanian bird has been discriminated
by Dr. Coues as a local race, with a desig-
nation of its own,  Dendroica ca~ru-
lescens eairnsi,  the points of distinc-
tion being its smaller size and the color of
the middle back, black instead of blue.
I cannot recollect that I perceived any-
thing peculiar about its notes, nor, so far
as appears, did Mr. Brewster do so; yet
it would not surprise me if such peculi-
arities were found to exist. The best of
ears (and there can be very few to sur-
pass Mr. Brewsters, I am sure) cannot
take heed of everything, especially in a
strange piece of country, with a voice
out of every bush calling for attention.
	A few birds, too familiar to have at-
tracted any particular notice on their
own account, became interesting because
of the fact that they were not included
among those found here by Mr. Brews-
ter. One of these was the Maryland
yellow-throat, of which Mr. Brewster
saw no signs above a level of 2100
feet. (The elevation of Highlands, Ii
may remind the reader, is 3800 feet.) At
the time of my visit, the song, witehery,
uitchery, witehery, or fidgety, fidgety,
fidgety (every listener will transliterate
the dactyls for himself), was to be heard
daily from the hotel piazza, though so
far away that, with Mr. Brewsters nega-
tive experience in mind, I deferred list-
ing the name till, after two or three
days, I found leisure to go down to the
swamp out of which the notes, whatever
they were, evidently proceeded. Then
it transpired that at least five males were
in song, in four different places. Later
(May 25) I happened upon one in still
another and more distant spot. Prob-
ably the species had come in since Mr.
Brewsters day (eleven years before),
with some change of local conditions, 
the cutting down of a piece of forest,
perhaps, and the formation of a bushy
swamp in its place. A villager closely
observant of such things, and well ac-
quainted with the bird, assured me from
his own recollection of the matter (and he
remembered Mr. Brewsters visit well)
that such was pretty certainly the case.
	Another bird seen almost daily, though
in limited numbers, was the red-winged
blackbird, which Mr. Brewster noticed
only in a few places in the lower val-
leys. It seemed well within the range
of probability that the same changes
which had brought in one lover of sedgy
tussocks and button-bushes should have
attracted also another. I made no search
for nests, but the fact that the birds were
seen constantly from May 7 to May 27
may be taken as reasonably conclusive
evidence that they were on their breed-
ing-grounds.
	Two or more pairs of phc~bes had set-
tled in the neighborhood, and two or
more pairs of parula warblers. The
former were not found by Mr. Brewster
above a level of 3000 feet, and the lat-
ter he missed at Highlands, although, as
he says, the presence of trees hung with
usnea lichens made their absence a sur-
prise.
	Hardly less rememberable than these
differences of experience was one strik-
ing coincidence. On the 25th of May,
when I had been at Highlands more than</PB>

a fortnight, I was sitting on the veranda
waiting for the dinner-bell, and reading
the praises of free silver in a Georgia
newspaper, when I jumped to my feet
at the whistle of a Baltimore oriole. I
started at once in pursuit, and presently
came up with the fellow, a resplendent
old male, in a patch of shrubbery bor-
dering the hotel grounds. I kept as
near him as I could (in Massachusetts
he would scarcely have drawn a second
look), and even followed him across the
street into a neighbors yard. He was
the only one I had seen (he was piping
again the next morning, the last of my
stay), and on referring to Mr. Brews-
ters paper I found that he too met
with one bird here, and in exactly the
same spot. The keeper of the hotel re-
membered the circumstance, and the plea-
sure of Mr. Brewster over it. In my
case, at any rate, the lateness and un-
expectedness of the birds appearance,
together with what a certain scholarly
friend of mine would have called his
uniquity, made him the bringer of
a most agreeable noonday excitement.
Where he had come from, and whether
he had brought a mate with him, were
questions I had no means of answering.
He reminded me of my one Georgia
oriole, on the field of Chickamauga.
	The road to Horse Cove, of which I
have already spoken, offered easy access
to a lower and more summery level, the
land at this point dropping almost per-
pendicularly for about a thousand feet.
In half an hour the pedestrian was in a
new climate, with something like a new
fauna about him. Here were such birds
as the Kentucky warbler, the hooded
warbler, the cardinal grosbeak, and the
Acadian flycatcher, none of them to be
discovered on the plateau above. Here,
also,  but this may have been nothing
more than an accident,  were the only
bluebirds (a single family) that I saw
	~	At Highlands I saw a single male,  an
unusually brilliant one,  which I was told was
the only bird of the kind in the vicinity.
anywhere until, on my journey out of the
mountains, I descended into the beauti-
ful Cullowhee Valley.
	At Highlands the birds were a mixed
lot, Southerners and Northerners de-
lightfully jumbled: a few Carolina wrens
(one was heard whistling from the sum-
mit of Whiteside!) ; a single Bewick
wren, singing and dodging along a fence
in the heart of the village; tufted tit-
mice; Carolina chickadees; Louisiana
water thrushes and turkey buzzards: and
on the other side of the account, brown
creepers, red-bellied nuthatches, black-
throated blues, Canada warblers, Black-
burnians, snowbirds, and olive-sided fly-
catchers.
	An unexpected thing was the coIn-
monness of blue golden-winged warbiers,
chats, and brown thrashers (the chats
less common than the other two) at an
elevation of 3800 feet. Still more numner-
ous, in song continually, even on the sum-
mit of Satulah, were the chestnut-sided
warblers, although Mr. Brewster, in his
tour through the region, rarely saw
more than one or two in any single
day: a third instance, as seemed likely,
of a species that had taken advantage
of new local conditions  an increase of
shrubby clearings, in the present cm~se
 within the last ten years. Here, as
everywhere, the presence of some birds
and the absence of others were provoca-
tive of questions. Why should the Ken-
tucky warbler sing from rhododendron
thickets halfway up the slope at the
head of Horse Cove, and never be tempt-
ed into other thickets, in all respects like
them, just over the brow of the cliff,
500 feet higher? Why should the sum-
mer yellow-bird, which pushes its hardy
spring flight beyond the Arctic circle,
restrict itself here in the Carolinas to the
low valley lands (I saw it at Walhalla
and in the Cullowhee Valley), and never
once choose a nesting-site in appropriate
surroundings at a little higher level?
Why should the chat and the blue golden.
wing find life agreeable at Highlands,</PB>

and their regular neighbors, the prairie
warbler and the white-eyed vireo, so per-
sistently refuse to follow them? And
why, in the first half of May, was there
so strange a dearth of migrants in these
attractive mountain woods ?  a few
blackpoll warbiers (last seen on the
18th), a single myrtle-bird (on the 7th),
and a crowd of rose-breasted grosbeaks
and Blackburnian warblers (on the 8th
and 9th, especially) being almost the
only ones to fall under my notice. After
all, one of the best birds I saw, not for-
getting the Wilsons phalarope, my ad-
venture with which has been detailed in
an earlier paper,  was a song sparrow
singing from a dense swampy thicket on
the 25th of May. So far as I am aware,
no bird of his kind has ever before been
reported in summer from a point so far
south. He looked natural, but not in
the least commonplace, as, after a long
wait on my part,  for the sake of ab-
s@lute certainty,  he hopped out into
sight. I was proud to have made one
discovery!
	In such a place, so limited in the range
of its physical conditions,  a village
surrounded by forest,  the birds, how-
ever numerous they might be, counted
as individuals, were sure to be of com-
paratively few species. Omitting such
as were certainly, or almost certainly,
migrants or strays,  the blackpoll, the
myrtle-bird, the barn swallow, the king-
bird, the solitary sandpiper, and the
phalarope,  and such as were found
only at a lower level, in Horse Cove and
elsewhere; omitting, too, all birds of
prey,  few, and 1~or the most part but
imperfectly identified; restricting my-
self to birds fully made out and believed
to be summering in the immediate neigh-
borhood of Highlands; omitting the
raven, of course,  I counted but fifty-
nine species.
	All things considered, I was not in-
consolable at finding my ornithological
activities in some measure abridged. I
had the more time, though still much too
little, for other pursuits. It would have
been good to spend the whole of it upon
the plants, or in admiring the beauties
of the country itself. As it was, I
plucked a blossom here and there, stored
up a few of the more striking of them
in the memory, and enjoyed many an
hour in gazing upon the new wild world,
where, no matter how far I climbed, there
was nothing to be seen on all sides but
a sea of hills, wave rising beyond wave
to the horizons rim.
	The horizon was never far off. I was
twice on Satulah and twice on White-
side, from which latter point, by all
accounts, I should have had one of
the most extensive and beautiful pro-
spects to be obtained in North Caroli-
na; but I had fallen upon one of those
spells of weather, common in moun-
tainous places, which make a visitor feel
as if nothing were so rare as a transpar-
ent atmosphere. For ordinary lowland
purposes the days were no doubt favor-
able enough: a pleasing, wholesome al-
ternation of rain and shine, wind and
calm, with no lack of thunder and light-
n.ing, and once, at least, a lively hail-
storm. Weather like this I have never
seen elsewhere. Such air! So I
wrote iii my enthusiasm, thinking of
physical comfort,  a man who wished
to walk and sit still by turns, and be nei-
ther sunstruck nor chilled; but withal,
there was never an hour of clear dis-
tance till the morning I came away,
when mountain ascents were no longer
to be thought of. The world was all
in a cover of mist, and the outlying
hills, one beyond another, with the haze
settling into the valleys between them,
were, as I say, like the billows of the
sea. Nothing could have been more
beautiful, perhaps; but a curtain is a
curtain, and I longed to see it rise. A
change of wind, a puff from the north-
west, and creation ~vould indeed have
widened in mans view. That was
not to be, and all those lofty North Car-
olina peaks  of which, to a New Eng</PB>

lander, there seem to be so many1  were
seen by me only from railway trains and
from the hotel veranda at Asheville, on
my journey homeward. On Satulali and
Whiteside I was forced to please myself
with the glory of the foreground. What
lay beyond the mist was matter for
dreams.
	But even as things were, I was not so
badly used. There was more beauty in
sight than I could begin to see, and, not-
withstanding the comparative narrowness
of the outlook,  partly because of it, 
one of my most enjoyable forenoons was
spent on the broad, open, slightly round-
ed summit of Satulah. Here and there
	more here than there, my pencil
says) a solitary cabin was visible, or a
bit of road, a ribbon of brown amidst
the green of the forest, but no village, nor
so much as a hamlet. The only other
signs of human existence were a light
smoke, barely distinguishable, risingfrom
Horse Cove as I guessed, and, for a few
minutes, a man whom my eye fell upon
most unexpectedly, a motionless speck,
though he was walking, far down the
Walhalla road. I turned my glass that
way, and behold, he had the usual bag of
grain on his back.
	The date was May 12. I had been
in Highlands less than a week, and my
thoughts still ran upon ravens, the birds
which, more even than the southern
snowbird and the mountain vireo, I had
come hither to seek. They were said
often to fly over, and this surely should
be a place to see them. They could not
escape me, if they passed within a mile.
But though I kept an eye out, as we say,
and an ear open, it was a vigil thrown
away. Buzzards, swifts, and a bunch of
twittering goldflnches were all the birds
that flew over. A chestnut-sided
warbler sang so persistently from the
mountain side just below that his sharp
voice became almost a trouble. From
	1 According to a publication of the State
Board of Agriculture, North Carolina contains
forty-three peaks more than 6000 feet high,
	VOL. LXXXII.  NO. 492.	32
the same quarter rose the songs of an
oven-bird, a rose-breasted grosbeak, and
a scarlet tanager. On the summit itself
were snowbirds and chewinks; and once,
to my delight, a field sparrow gave out
a measure or two. After all, go where
you will, you will hear few voices that
wear better than his,  clear, smooth,
most agreeably modulated, and temper-
ately sweet.
	The only trees I remember at the very
top of the mountain were a few dwarfed
and distorted pines and white oaks, 
enough to remind a Yankee that he was
not in New Hampshire. On the other
hand, here grew our Massachusetts huc-
kleberry (Gaylussacia resinoscs), which
I had seen nowhere below, where a
great abundance of the buckberry  so
I think I heard it called (G. ursina), .
taller bushes, more comfortable to pick
from, with larger blossoms  seemed to
have taken its place. I should have
been glad to try the fruit, which was de-
scribed as of excellent quality. On that
point, with no thought of boasting, I
could have spoken as an expert. With
the huckleberry was chokeberry, another
New England acquaintance, fair to look
upon, but a hypocrite,  by their fruits
ye shall know them; and underneath,
among the stones, were common yellow
five-fingers, bird-foot violets, and leaves
of trailing arbutus, three-toothed poten-
tilla (a true mountain-lover), checker-
berry, and galax. With them, but de-
serving a sentence by themselves, were
the exquisite vernal iris and the scarlet
painted cup, otherwise known as the In-
dians paint-brush and prairie fire, splen-
did for color, and in these parts, to my
astonishment, a frequenter of the forest.
I should have looked for it only in
grassy meadows. Here and there grew
close patches of the pretty, alpine-look-
ing sand myrtle (Lejophyllum bux~fo-
hum), thickly covered with small white

eighty-two others more than 6000 feet high, and
an innumerable multitude the altitude of
which is between 4000 and 5000 feet.</PB>

flowers,  a plant which I had seen for
the first time the day before on the sum-
mit of Whiteside. Mountain heather I
called it, finding no English name in
Chapmans Flora. Stunted laurel bushes
in small bud were scattered over the sum-
mit. A little later they would make the
place a flower garden. A single rose-
acacia tree had already done its best in
that direction, with a full crop of gor-
geous rose-purple clusters. The winds
had twisted it and kept it down, but could
not hinder its fruitfulness.
	These things, and others like them, I
noticed between times. For the most
part, my eyes were upon the grand pano-
rama, a wilderness of hazy, forest-cov-
ered mountains, as far as the eye could
go; nameless to me, all of them, with
the exception of the two most conspicu-
ous,  Whiteside on the one hand, and
Rabun Bald on the other. For my com-
fort a delicious light breeze was stirring,
and the sky, as it should be when one
climbs for distant prospects, was sprin-
kled with small cumulus clouds, which
in turn dapph~d the hills with moving
shadows. One thing brought home to
me a truth which in our dullness we or-
dinarily forget: that the earth itself is but
a shadow, a something that appeareth,
changeth, and passeth away. The rocks
at my feet were full of pot-holes, such
as I had seen a day or two before, the
water still swirling in them, at Cullasa-
jah Falls. As universal time is reck-
oned,  if it is reckoned,  old Satulah
and all that forest-covered world which
I saw, or thought I saw, from it, were
but of yesterday, a divine improvisa-
tion, and would be gone to-morrow.
	More beautiful than the round pro-
spect from Satulah, though perhaps
less stimulating to the imagination, was
the view from the edge of the moun-
tain wall at the head of Horse Cove.
Here, under a chestnut tree, I spent the
greater part of a half day, the valley
with its road and its four or five houses
straight at my feet. A dark precipice
of bare rock bounded it on the right, a
green mountaia on the left, and in the
distance southward were ridges and
peaks without number. A few of the
nearer hills I knew the names of by this
time: Fodderstack, Bearpen, Hogback,
Chimneytop, Terrapin, Shortoff, Scaly,
and Whiteside. Satulah was the only
fine name in the lot; and that, for a
guess, is aboriginal. The North Amer-
ican Indians had a genius for names, as
the Greeks had for sculpture and poetry,
and will be remembered for it.
	I had come to the brow of the cliffs,
at a place called Lovers Leap, in search
of a particular kind of rhododendron.
It bore a small flower, my informant had
said, and grew hereabout only in this
one spot. It proved to be 1?. punctct-
turn, new to me, and now (May 23) in
early blossom. Four days afterward, in
the Cullowhee and Tuckaseegee valleys,
I saw riverbanks and roadsides lined
with it; very pretty, of course, being a
rhododendron, but not to be compared
in that respect with the purple rhodo-
dendron or mountain rose-bay (R. Ca-
tawbiense). That, also, was to be found
here, but very sparingly, as far as I could
discover. I felicitated myself on having
seen it in its glory on the mountains of
southeastern Tennessee. The common
large rhododendron (R. maximum)
stood in thickets along all the brooks. I
must have walked and driven past a hun-
dred miles of it, on the present trip, it
seemed to me; but I have never been at
the South late enough to see it in flower.
	What I shall remember longest about
the flora of Highlands  and there is
no part of eastern North America that
is botanically richer, I suppose  is the
azaleas. When I drove up from Wal-
hahla, on the 6th of May, the woods were
bright, mile after mile, with the com-
mon pink species (A. nudiftora); and
at Highlands, in some of the dooryards,
I found in full bloom a much lovelier
kind,  also pink, and also leafless, 
A. Vaseyi, as it turned out: a rare and</PB>

lately discovered plant, of which the
village people are justly proud. I could
not visit its wild habitat without a
guide, they told me. Within a week or
so after my arrival the real glory of the
spring was upon us: the woods were
lighted up everywhere with the flame-
colored azalea; and before it was gone,
 while it was still at its height, indeed,
 the familiar sweet-scented white aza-
lea (A. viscosa), the swamp pink of
my boyhood, came forward to keep it
company and lend it contrast. By that
time I had seen all the rhododendrons and
azaleas mentioned in Chapmans Flora,
including A. arborescens, a tardy bloom-
er, which a botanical collector, with whom
I was favored to spend a day on the
road, pointed out to me in the bud.
	The splendor of A. calendidacca, as
displayed here, is never to be forgotten;
nor is it to be in the least imagined by
those who have seen a few stunted speci-
mens of the plant in northern gardens.
The color ranges from light straw-color
to the brightest and deepest orange, and
the bushes, thousands on thousands, no
two of them alike, stand, not in rows or
clusters, but broadly spaced, each by it-
self, throughout the hillside woods.
	They were never out of sight, and
I never could have enough of them.
Wherever I went, I was always stop-
ping short before one bush and another;
admiring this one for the brilliancy or
delicacy of its floral tints, and that one
for its bold and pleasing habit. For as
the plants do not grow in close ranks,
so they do not put forth their flowers in
a mass. They know a trick better than
that. Thousands of shrubs, but every one
in its own place, to be separately looked
at; and on every shrub a few sprays of
bloom, each well apart from all the oth-
ers; one twig bearing nothing but leaves,
another full of blossoms; a ~hort branch
here, a longer one there; and again, a
smooth straight stem shooting far aloft,
holding at the tip a bunch of leaves and
flowers; everything free, unstudied, and
most irregularly graceful, as if the bushes
had each an individuality as well as a tint
of its own.
	One walk on Satulah  not to the sum-
mit, but by a roundabout course through
the woods to a bold cliff on the southern
side (all the mountains, as a rule, are
rounded on the north, and break off
sharply on the south)  was literally a
walk through an azalea show: first the
flame-colored, bushes beyond count and
variety beyond description; and then, a
little higher, a plentiful display of the
white viscosa, more familiar and less
showy, but hardly less attractive.
	Better even than this wild Satulah
garden was a smaller one nearer home:
a triangular hillside, broad at the base
and pointed at the top, as if it were one
face of a pyramid; covered loosely with
grand old trees,  oaks, chestnuts, and
maples; the ground densely matted with
freshly grown ferns, largely the cinna-
mon osmunda, clusters of lively green
and warm brown intermixed; and every-
where, under the trees and above the
ferns, mountain laurel and flame-colored
azalea,  the laurel blooms pale pink, al-
most white, and the azalea clusters yel-
low of every conceivable degree of depth
and brightness. A zigzag fence bound-
ed the wood below, and the land rose at
a steep angle, so that the whole was held
aloft, as it were, for the beholders con-
venience. It was a wonder of beauty,
with nothing in the least to mar its per-
fection,  the fairest piece of earth my
eye ever rested upon. The human own-
er of it, Mr. Selleck (why should I not
please myself by naming him, a land-
owner who knew the worth of his pos-
session !), had asked me to go and see
it; and for his sake and its own, as well
as for my own sake and the readers, I
wish I could show it as it was. It rises
before me at this moment, like the rho-
dodendron cliffs on Waldens Ridge, and
will do so, I hope, to my dying day.

XXXIII.

	MATTINGLEYS dungeon was infested
with rats and other vermin; he had only
straw for his bed, and his food and drink
were bread and water. The walls were
damp with moisture from the Fauxbie
which ran beneath, and little more than
a glimmer of light came through a small
barred window. Superstition had sur-
rounded the Vier Prison with horrors.
As carts passed under the great arch-
way, its depth multiplied the sounds so
powerfully, the echoes were so fantastic,
that folk believed them the roarings of
fiendish spirits. If a mounted guard
hurried through, the reverberations of
the drumbeats and the clatter of hoofs
were so uncouth that children stopped
their ears and fled in terror. To the
ignorant populace, the Vier Prison was
the home of noisome serpents, and the
rendezvous of the devil and his witches
of Rocbert.
	When, therefore, the seafaring mer-
chant of the Vier Marchi, whose mas-
sive, brass-studded bahue had been as a
gay bazaar where the gentry of Jersey
refreshed their wardrobes with one eye
closed,  when he was transferred to the
Vier Prison, little wonder that he should
be,come a dreadful being, round whom
played the lightnings of dark fancy and
sombre terror! Elie Mattingley the pop-
ular sinner, with insolent gold rings in
his ears, and unquestioned as to how he
came by his merchandise, was one per-
son; Elie Mattingley prepared as a torch
for the burning, and housed amid the
terrors of the Vier Prison, was another.
	Few persons in Jersey slept during the
night before his execution. Here and
there compassionate women or unimpor-
tant men lay awake through pity, and
a few through a vague sense of loss, 
for henceforth the Vier Marchi would
lack a familiar interest; but mostly the
people of Mattingleys world were kept
awake through curiosity. Morbid ex-
pectation of the coming event had for
them a touch of gruesome diversion; it
would relieve the monotony of existence,
and provide hushed gossip for vraic-
gatherings and veilles for a long time
to come. Thus Elie Mattingleys death
would not be in vain.
	Many things had come at once. Mat-
tingley was one sensation, but there was
still another. Olivier Delagarde had
been unmasked as a traitor, and the
whole island had gone tracking him
down. No aged toothless tiger was ever
sported through the jungle by an army
of shikaris with hungrier malice than was
the broken, helpless, and evil Olivier De-
lagarde by the people he had betrayed.
Ensued, therefore, a commingling of de-
vout patriotism and lust of man-hunting
with a comely content in the expected
sacrifice of the morrow.
	Nothing of his neighbors excitement
disturbed Mattingley. He did not sleep,
but that was because he was still watch-
ing and waiting for a means of escape.
He felt his chances diminish, however,
when, about midnight, an extra guard
was put round the prison,  not so much
to prevent escape as further to confirm
the dignity of the Royal Court. Some-
thing had gone amiss in the matter of
his rescue.
	Three things had been planned. First,
Mattingley was to try escape by the
small window of the dungeon.
	Secondly, Carterette was to bring Se-
bastian Alixandre to the Vier Prison
disguised as a sorrowing aunt of the con-
demned man, known to live in Guernsey.
Alixandre was suddenly to overpower
the jailer; Mattingley was to make a
rush for freedom, and a few bold spirits
without would second his efforts and</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00507" SEQ="0507" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="501">	The Battle of the Strong.	501

smuggle him to the sea. The directing
mind and hand in the business were
Ranuiph Delagardes. He was to have
his boat waiting in the harbor of St.
Heliers to respond to a signal from the
shore, to pilot them clear of the harbor
and make sail for France, where he and
his father were to be landed. There he
would give Mattingley, Alixandre, and
Carterette his own boat, to fare across
the seas to the great fishing-ground of
Gasp~ in Canada.
	Lastly, if these projects failed, the ex-
ecutioner was to be drugged with liquor,
his besetting weakness, on the eve of the
hanging.
	The first of these plans had been
found impossible, the window being too
small for even Mattingleys head to get
through. The second failed because the
Royal Court had forbidden Carterette
further admittance to the prison, intent
that she should no longer be contami~
nated by so vile a wretch. This Chris-
tian solicitude had looked down from
the windows of the Cobue Royale upon
this same criminal in the Vier Marchi,
with a blind eye for himself the sinner,
and an open one for his merchandise;
but now, restored to full sight by that
oculist ca]led accident, it had straight-
way righteously done what so long it had
amiably left undone.
	As the night wore on, Mattingley could
hear the hollow sound of the sentinels
steps under the archway of the Vier Pri-
son. He was stoical. If he had to die,
then he had to die. Death could only
be a little minute of agony; and for what
came after  well, he had not thought
fearfully of that, and he had no wish to
think of it at all. The clergyman who
had visited him had talked, and he had
not listened; he had his own ideas about
life and death and the beyond, and they
were not ungenerous. He had seemed
to his visitor patient, but impossible;
kindly, but unresponsive; sometimes even
curious, but without remorse.
	You should repent with sorrow and
a contrite heart, the clergyman had
said. You have done many evil things
in your life, Mattingley.
	Mattingley had replied, Ah bah, I
cant rememl)er them! I know I never
done them, for I never done anything
but good all my life,  so much for so
much.
	He had argued it out with himself,
and he believed he was a good man.
He had been open-handed, fair in a bar-
gain, had stood by his friends, and, up
to a few days ago, had been outwardly
counted a good citizen, for many had
come to profit through him. His trades
 a little smuggling, a little piracy.
Was not the former hallowed by distin-
guished patronage, and had it not existed
from time immemorial ? The latter was
fair fight for gain,  an eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth. If he had not
robbed others on the high seas, they
would probably have robbed him,  and
sometimes they did. His spirit was that
of the Elizabethan buccaneers who de-
feated the invincible Armada; he be-
longed to a century not his own. As for
the crime for which he was to suffer
death, it had been the work of a confed-
erate; and very bad work it was,  to
try to steal Jean Touzels Hardi Biaou,
and then bungle it! He had had nothing
to do with it, for he and Jean Touzel were
the best of friends, as was proved by the
fact that while he lay in his dungeon
awaiting death, Jean wandered the shore
distracted and sorrowing for Matting-
leys fate.
	Thinking now of the whole business
and of his past life, Mattingley suddenly
had a pang. Yes, remorse smote him at
last. There was one thing on his con-
science,  only one. He had a profound
reverence for the feelings of others, and
where the Church was concerned this
was mingled with a droll sort of pity, as
of the greater for the lesser, the wise
for the helpless. For clergymen he had
a half-affectionate contempt. He remem-
bered now that his confederate, who had</PB>

turned out so badly  he had trusted
him, too !  when, four years ago, he
wickedly robbed the Church of St. Mi-
chaels, and carried off the great chest
with Communion plate, offertories, and
rent, had piously left behind in Matting-
leys house the vestry books and register,
 a nice definition in rogues etiquette
and ethics. It smote Mattingleys soul
now, that these stolen books had not been
returned to St. Michaels. His sense of
reverence was shocked. Next morning
he must send word to Carterette to re-
store these records. Then his conscience
would be clear once more. With this
intention quieting his mind, he turned
over on his straw and went peacefully
to sleep.
	Hours afterward he waked with a
yawn. There was no start, no terror,
but the appearance of the jailer with the
devoted clergyman roused in him a sense
of disgust for the approaching function
at the Mont ~s Pendus,  disgust was
his chief feeling. This was no way for
a man to die! With a choice of evils,
he would have preferred walking the
plank, or even dying quietly in his bed,
to being stifled by a rope. To dangle
from a crosstree like a half-filled bag
offended every instinct of picturesque-
ness; and always and above all he had
been picturesque.
	He asked at once for pencil and pa-
per. His wishes were instantly obeyed,
and with deference. On the whole, he
realized, by the attentions paid him, 
the brandy offered by the jailer, the
fluttering grave tenderness of the cler-
gyman,  that in the life of a criminal
there is one moment when he com-
mands the situation. He refused the
brandy, for he was strongly against spir-
ituous liquors in the early morning; but
he ordered coffee, for he was thirsty.
Eating seemed superfluous; besides, he
thought a man might die more gayly
on an empty stomach. He assured the
clergyman that he had come to terms
with his conscience, and was now about
to perform the last act of a well-inten-
tioned life.
	There and then he wrote to Carterette,
telling her about the vestry books of St.
Michaels, and making his last request
that she should restore them. There
were no affecting messages between him
and the girl,  they understood each
other. He knew that when it was pos-
sible she would never fail to come to the
mark where he was concerned, and she
had equal faith in him. So the letter
was sealed, addressed with flourishes, 
he was proud of his handwriting,  and
handed to the clergyman for Carterette.
	He had scarcely finished his coffee
when there was a roll of drums outside.
Mattingley knew that his hour was come,
and yet, to his surprise, he had no ex-
traordinary sensations. He had a shock
presently, however; for on the jailers
announcing the executioner, who should
be standing there before him but the
undertakers apprentice! In politeness
to the clergyman Mattingley forbore
profanity,  a gracious self-denial. This
was the one Jerseyman for whom he had
a profound hatred,  this youth with the
slow, cold, watery blue eye, a face that
never wrinkled with either mirth or mis-
ery, the teeth set square in the jaw al-
ways showing a little, making an invol-
untary grimace of cruelty. Here was
insult.
	Help of Heaven, so you re going to
do it  you! broke out Mattingley.
	The other man is drunk, said the
undertakers apprentice; he s been full
as a jug three days. He got drunk too
soon. The grimace seemed to widen.
	Oh my good! said Mattingley, and
he would say no more. To him words
were like nails,  of no use unless they
were to be driven home by acts.

	To Mattingley the procession to the
Mont ~s Pendus was stupidly slow. As
it issued from the archway of the Vier
Prison between mounted guards, and
passed through the lane made by the</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00509" SEQ="0509" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="503">	flihe Battle of the Strong.	503

moving mass of spectators, he looked
round coolly. One or two bold spirits
cried out, Head up to the wind, Maitre
Elie!
	Oui-gia, he replied; devil a top-
sail in! and turned with a look of
contempt on those who hooted him. He
realized now that there was no chance
of rescue. The island militia and the
town guard were in ominous force; and
although his respect for the militia was
not devout, a bullet from the musket of
a fool was as effective as one from Bona-
pends,  as Napoleon Bonaparte was
disdainfully called in Jersey. Yet he
could not but wonder why all the plans of
Alixandre, Carterette, and Ranulph had
gone for nothing,  even the hangman
had been got drunk too soon! He had
a high opinion of Ranulph, and that he
should fail him was a blow to his judg-
ment of humanity.
	He was thoroughly disgusted. Also
they had compelled him to put on a
white shirt,  he who had never worn
linen in his life. He was ill at ease in
it.	It made him conspicuous; it looked
as though he were aping the gentleman
at the last. He tried to resign himself;
but resignation was not to be learned so
late in life. Somehow, he could not feel
that this was really the day of his death.
Yet how could it be otherwise? There
was the vicomte in his red robe. There
was the sinister undertakers apprentice,
proud of his importance, ready to do his
hangmans duty with no twinge of sen-
timent. There, as they crossed the
mielles, while the sea droned its sing-
song on his left, was the parson droning
his sing-song on the right,  In the
midst of life we are in death, etc.
There were the red-coated militia, the
unkempt mounted guard, the grumbling
drums, and the crowd morbidly enjoying
their Roman holiday. And there, loom-
ing up before him, were the four stone
pillars on the Mont ~s Pendus from
which he was to swing. His disgust
deepened. He was not dying like a
seafarer who had fairly earned his repu-
tation.
	His feelings found vent even as he
came to the foot of the platform where
he was to make his last stand, and the
guards formed a square about the great
pillars, glooming like Druidic altars
awaiting their victim. He burst forth
in one phrase expressive of his feelings.
	Sacr6 matin, so damned paltry!
he said, in equal tribute to two races.
	The undertakers apprentice, mistak-
ing his meaning, and thinking it a reflec-
tion upon his arrangements, returned,
with a wave of the hand to the rope,
Chest tr~s ship-shape, maitre! But
he was wrong. He had made everything
ship-shape, as he thought; but two ob-
scure, dishonored folk, one a wise man
and the other a fool, had set a gin for
him. The rope to be used at the hanging
had been prepared, examined by the vi-
comte, approved, and the undertakers
apprentice had carried it to his room at
the top of the Cohue Royale. In the
dead of night, however, Dormy Jamais
drew it from under the mattress, and sub-
stituted one which was too long. This
had been Ranulphs idea as a last resort;
for he had a grim satisfaction in trying
to foil the law even at the twelfth hour!

	The great moment had come. The
shouts and hootings ceased. Out of the
silence there rose only the champing of
a horses bit or the hysterical giggle of a
woman. The high, painful drone of the
parsons voice was heard.
	Then came the fatal Aijaintenant!
from the vicomte. The platform fell,
and Elie Mattingley dropped the length
of the rope.
	What was the consternation of the
vicomte and the hangman, and the hor-
ror of the crowd, to see that Matting-
leys toes just touched the ground! The
body shook and twisted. The man was
being slowly strangled, not hanged.
	The undertakers apprentice was the
only person who kept a cool head. The</PB>

solution of the problem of the rope for
afterward; but he had been sent there
to hang a man, and a man he would
hang somehow. Without more ado, he
jumped upon Mattingleys shoulders and
began to drag him down.
	The next instant some one burst
through the mounted guard and the mili-
tia: it was Ranuiph Delagarde. Rushing
to the vicomte, he exclaimed, Shame!
The man was to be hung, not strangled!
This is murder! Stop it, or I 11 cut the
rope! He looked round on the crowd.
Cowards! cowards! he cried, will
you see him murdered?
	He started forward to drag away the
executioner, but the vicomte, thoroughly
terrified at Ranulphs onset, seized the
undertakers apprentice, who drew off
with unruffled malice, and with steely
eyes watched what followed.
	Mattingleys feet were now firmly on
the ground. While the excited crowd
tried to break through the cordon of
militia and mounted guards, Mattingley,
by a twist and a jerk, freed his corded
hands. Loosing the rope at his neck,
he opened his eyes and looked around
him, dazed and dumb.
	The apprentice came forward. I 11
shorten the rope  oui-gia! Then you
shall see him swing! he grumbled
viciously to the vicomte.
	The gaunt vicomte was trembling with
excitement. This was an unexpected
situation. He looked helplessly around.
	The apprentice caught hold of the
rope to tie knots in it and so shorten it;
but Ranulph again appealed to the vi-
comte, although in his voice there was
more command than appeal.
	You ye hung the man, he said;
you ye strangled him, and you ye not
killed him. You ye got no right to put
that rope round his neck again!
	Two jurats who had waited on the out-
skirts of the crowd, furtively watching
the carrying out of their sentence, burst
in, as excited and nervous as the vicomte.
	Hang the man again, and the whole
world will laugh at you, Ranulph said.
If you re not worse than fools or
Turks, you 11 let him go. He has suf-
fered death already. Take him back to
the prison, if you re afraid to free him!
He turned round to the crowd fiercely.
Have you nothing to say to this butch-
ery? he cried. For the love of God,
have nt you anything to say?
	Half the crowd shouted, Let him go
free!  and the other half, disappoint-
ed in the working out of the gruesome
melodrama, groaned and hooted.
	Meanwhile, Mattingley stood as still
as ever he had stood by his bahue in the
Vier Marchi, watching  waiting.
	The vicomte conferred with the jurats
nervously for a moment, and then turned
to the guard and said, Escort the pri-
soner to the Vier Prison.
	Mattingley had been slowly solving
the problem of his salvation. His eye,
like a gimlet, bad screwed its way
through Ranulphs words into what lay
behind, and at last be understood the
whole beautiful scheme. It pleased him.
Carterette had been worthy of herself
and of him. Ranuiph had played his
gam&#38; well, too. Sebastian Alixandre,
whom now he saw peering over the
shoulders of a mihitiaman,  he was en-
tirely proud of him, also. He failed only
to do justice to one,  even to the poor
b6ganne, Dormy Jamais. But then the
virtue of fools is its own reward.
	As the procession started back, with
the undertakers apprentice following
Mattingley, not going before, Mattingley
turned to him, and with a smile of mal-
ice said, Chest trbs ship-shape, maitre
 eh? end he jerked his head back
toward the inadequate rope.
	He was not greatly troubled about
the rest of this grisly farce~ He was
now ready for breakfast, and his appetite
grew as he heard how the crowd hooted
and snarled yahl at the apprentice. He
was quite easy about the future. What
had been so well done thus far could not
fail in the end.</PB>

	Events proved Mattingley right. It
is more than probable that the fury of
the Royal Court, when they heard he
had broken prison, was not quite sincere;
for it was notable that the night of his
escape, suave and uncrestfallen, they
dined in the Rue dcs Tres Pigeons, in the
sanctuary provided for them by mine
host Maitre Lys. The flight of Matting-
ley gave them a happy issue from their
quandary.
	No one in Jersey knew how it was
that Mattingley broke jail, nor who
connived at it, but the vicomte officially
explained that he had escaped by the
dungeon window. People came to see
the window, and there, bk sO, the
bars were gone! But that did not prove
the case, and the mystery was deepened
by the fact that Jean Touzel, whose head
was too small for Elie Mattingleys hat,
could not get that same head through
the dungeon window. Having proved so
much, Jean left the mystery there, and
returned to the Hardi Biaou.
	This happened on the morning after
the dark night when Mattingley, Carte-
rette, and Alixandre hurried from the
Vier Prison through the Rue des Sa-
blons to the sea, and there boarded Ra-
nulphs boat, wherein was Olivier Dela-
garde, the traitor.
	Accompanying Carterette to the shore
was a little figure that moved along be-
side them like a shadow,  a little gray
figure that carried a gold-headed cane
given to him by the late monarch of
France. At the shore this same little
gray figure bade Mattingley good-by
with a quavering voice. Whereupon
Carterette, her face all wet with tears,
kissed him upon both cheeks, and sobbed
so that she could scarcely speak. For
now when it was all over  all the hor-
rible ordeal over  the woman in her
broke down before the little old gentle-
man who had been so kind to her, who
had been like a benediction in the house
where the ten commandments were im-
perfectly upheld. But she choked down
her sobs, and, thinking of another woman
more than of herself, said 
Dear chevalier, do not forget that
book I gave you to-night. Read it 
read the last writing in it, and then you
will know  ah bidemme!  but you
will know that her we love  ah, but
you must read it, and tell nobody till 
till you see her. She has nt held her
tongue for naught, and it s only fair to
do as she s done all along. Pardingue,
but my heart hurts me!  she added,
and she caught the hand that held the
gold-headed cane and kissed it with im-
pulsive ardor. You have been so good
to me  oui-gia! she said; and then
she dropped the hand, and fled to the
boat rocking in the surf.
	The little chevalier watched the boat
glide out into the gloom of night, and
waited till he knew that they must all
be aboard Ranulphs schooner and mak-
ing for the sea. Then he went slowly
back to the empty house in the Rue
dEgypte.

	Opening the book that Carterette had
placed in his hands before they left the
house, he turned up and scanned closely
the last written page. A moment after
he started violently; his eyes dilated,
first with wonder, then with a bewil-
dered joy; and then, Protestant though
he was, with the instinct of his long-
gone forefathers, he made the sacred
sign, and said, Now I have not lived
and loved in vain, thanks be to God!

	Even as joy opened the eyes of this
wan old man who had been sorely smit-
ten through the friends of his heart, out
at sea night and death were closing the
eyes of another wan old man who had
been a traitor to his country.
	For indeed the boat of the fugitives
had scarcely cleared reefs and rocks, and
reached the open Channel, when Olivier</PB>

Delagarde, uttering the same cry as when
Ranuiph and the soldiers had found him
wounded in the Grouville Road, fifteen
years before, suddenly started up from
where he had lain mumbling, and whis-
pering hoarsely, Ranulph  they ye
killed  me! fell back dead.
	True to the instinct which had kept
him faithful to one idea for fifteen years,
and in spite of the protests of Matting-
ley and Carterette,  of the despairing
Carterette, who felt the last thread of her
hopes snap with his going,  Ranuiph
at once made ready to leave them, and
bade them good-by. Placing his fathers
body in the rowboat, he drew back to
the shore of St. Aubins Bay with his
pale freight, and carried it on his shoul-
ders up to the little house where he had
lived for years.
	There he kept the death-watch alone.


	xxxv-
Guida knew nothing of the arrest and
trial of Mattingley until he had been con-
demned to death. Nor until then had
she known anything of what had hap-
pened to Olivier Delagarde; for the day
after her interview with Ranulph she
had gone a-marketing to the island of
Sark, with the results of a quarter of a
years knitting. Several times a year
she made this journey, landing at the
Eperqu6rie Rocks, as she had done one
day long ago, and selling her beautiful
wool caps and jackets to the farmers and
fisherfolk, getting in kind for what she
sold.
	This time she had remained at Sark
beyond her intention, for ugly gales from
the southeast came on, and then a slight
accident happened to her child, the
little Guilbert. Thus a month and over
passed, and by the time she was ready
to return to Plemont Mattingley had
been condemned.
	When Guida made these excursions to
Sark, Dormy Jamais always remained
at the little house, milking her cow, feed-
ing her fowls, and keeping all in order,
 as perfect a sentinel as Biribi, and as
faithful. For the first time in his life,
however, Dormy Jamais had been un-
faithful. Not long after Carcaud, the
baker, and Mattingley were arrested, he
deserted the hut at Plemont to exploit
the adventure which was at last to save
Olivier Delagarde and Mattingley from
death. But he had been unfaithful only
in the letter of his bond. He had gone
to the house of Jean Touzel, through
whose Hardi Biaou the disaster had
come, and had told Maitresse Aimable
that she must go to Plemont in his stead;
for a fool must keep his faith, whateer
the worldly-wise may do. So the poor
simpleton and the fat femme de ballast,
puffing with every step, trudged across
the island to Plemont. There the fool
installed the cumbrous figure in her place
as keeper of the house, and, tireless,
sleepless, trudged back again in the dark
night to his fugitives from justice.
	The next day Maitr&#38; sse Aimables
quiet had been invaded by two signalmen,
who kept watch, not far from Guidas
home, for all sail, friend or foe, hear-
ing in sight. They were now awaiting
the new admiral of the Jersey station
and his fleet, and they brought Mal-
tresse Aimable strange news. With
churlish insolence, they had entered the
hut before she could prevent it. Look-
ing round, they laughed meaningly, and
then told her that the commander pre-
sently coming to lie with his fleet in
Grouville Bay was none other than the
sometime Jersey midshipman, now Ad-
miral Prince Philip dAvranche, Duc de
Bercy. Mialtresse Aimable then under-
stood the meaning of their laughter, and
the insult they implied concerning Gui-
da; and again her voice came ravaging
out of the silence where it lay hid so of-
ten and so long, and the signalmen went
their way.
	Maitresse Aimable could not make
head or tail of her thoughts; they were</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00513" SEQ="0513" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="507">	The Battle of the Strong.	507

a mixture altogether. She could not see
an inch before her nose; all she could
feel was an aching heart for Guida. She
had heard strange tales of how Philip
had become Prince Philip dAvranche;
how the old. duke had died on the very
day that Philip had married the Coin-
tesse Chantavoine; how the imbecile
Prince Leopold John had succeeded;
how he had died suddenly; how Prince
Philip had become the Duc de Bercy;
and how he had fought his ship against
a French vessel off Ushant, and, though
she had heavier armament than his own,
had destroyed her. For this he had
been made an admiral. Only the other
day her Jean had brought the Gazette de
Jersey, in which all these things were re-
lated, and had spelled them out for her.
And now this same Philip dAvranche,
with his new name and fame, was on his
way to defend the Isle of Jersey.
	Maitresse Aimables muddled mind
could not get hold of this new Philip.
For years she had thought him a mon-
ster, and here he was, a great and val-
iant gentleman to the world. He had
done a thing that Jean would rather
have cut off his hand  both hands 
than do, and yet here he was, an ad-
miral, a prince, and a sovereign duke,
and men like Jean were as dust beneath
his feet! The real Philip she had known,
and he was the man who had spoiled the
life of a woman; this other Philip,  she
could read about him, she could think
about him, just as she could think about
William and his Horse in Boulay Bay,
or the Little Bad Folk of Rocbert, but
she could not realize him as a thing of
flesh and blood and actual being. The
more she tried to realize him, the more
mixed she became.
	As in her mental maze she sat pant-
ing her way to enlightenment, she saw
Guidas boat entering the little harbor.
Now the truth must be told; but how?

	After her first exclamation of wel-
come to mother and child, she struggled
painfully for her voice. She tried to
find words in which to tell Guida the
truth, but stopping in despair, she began
rocking the child back and forth, saying
only, Prince Admiral he  and now!
Oh my good, oh my good!
	At this point of hesitation Guidas
sharp intuition found the truth.
	Philip dAvranche! she said to
herself. Then aloud, in a shaking voice,
Philip dAvranche!
	Her heart suddenly leaped within her,
not with emotion at thought of him or
of anything that he had been to her, but
because she felt a crisis near. She could
not think clearly for a moment. It was
as if her brain had received a blow, and
all her head had a numb, singing sensa-
tion which obscured eyesight, hearing,
speech.
	When she had recovered a little, she
took the child from Maitresse Aimable,
and, pressing him to her bosom, placed
him in the Sieur de Mauprats great arm-
chair. Never before had the little Guil-
bert sat there. The outward action, or-
dinary as it was, seemed significant of
what was in her mind. The child him-
self realized something unusual, and he
sat perfectly still, his small hands spread
out on the big arms.
	You always believed in me, Tresse
Aimable, Guida said at last, in a low
voice.
	Oul-gia, what else? was the quick
reply. The instant responsiveness of
her own voice appeared to confound the
femme de ballast, and her face suffused.
	Guida stooped quickly and kissed her
on the cheek.
	You 11 never regret that. And you
will have to go on believing still; but
you 11 not be sorry at the end, Tresse
Aimable, she said, and turned away
to the fireplace.
	An hour afterward Maitresse Aimable
was upon her way to St. Heliers, but
now she carried her weight more easily
and panted less. No doubt this was be-
cause it was all downhill, added to the</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00514" SEQ="0514" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="508">	508	The Battle of the Strong.

remembrance that Guida had kissed her.
Moreover, twice within a month Jean
had given her ear a friendly pinch; sure-
ly she had reason to carry her weight
more lightly.
	That afternoon and evening Guida
struggled with herself. At first all her
thoughts were in conflict; the woman in
her shrinking from the ordeal that soon
must come, almost preferring the peace
of this isolation from her own world, in
the knowledge of her own uprightness.
But the mother in her pleaded, asserted,
commanded, ruled confused ideas and
emotions to quiet and definite purpose.
Finality of purpose once achieved, a kind
of peace came over her sick spirit; for
with finality there is quiescence, if not
peace.
	When she looked at the little Guil-
bert, refined and strong, curiously ob-
servant and sensitive in temperament,
so like herself, her courage suddenly
leaped to a higher point than it bad
ever known. This innocent had suffered
enough. What belonged to him he had
not had. He had been wronged in much
by his father, and maybe (and this was
the cruel part of it) had been unwitting-
ly wronged  alas, how unwittingly ! 
by her. If she gave her own life many
times, it still could be no more than was
the childs due.
	Gazing at him now, seated in the great
armchair, his look carrying the con-
sciousness of some new dignity to which
he must conform, her heart swelled with
pride of him. How well they under-
stood each other, and how wise was the
child! He seemed always to feel what
was going on in his mothers mind. It
was almost uncanny, his interpretation
of her thoughts. Often she had glanced
up from her work to find his eyes fixed
upon her, just as her own mothers gaze
had been wont to rest upon her, though
the looks had been so different ; this
later tie was so close, so vital, so inti-
mate.
	An impulse seized her now, and, with
a quick explosion of feeling, she dropped
on her knees in front of the armchair.
Looking into his eyes, as though hun-
gering for the word she so often yearned
to hear, she said, You love your mo-
ther, Guilbert ? You love her, little
son
	With a pretty smile and eyes brim-
ming with affectionate fun, but without
a word, the child put out a tiny hand
and drew the fingers softly down his
mothers face.
	Speak, little son: tell your mother
that you love her.
	The little hand pressed itself over
her eyes, and a gay laugh came from
the sensitive lips; then both arms ran
round her neck. The child drew her
head to him impulsively, and kissing her,
a little upon the hair and a little upon
the forehead, so indefinite was the em-
brace, he said, Si, maman, I loves you
best of all I Then, preoccupied with
his new dignity, he sat back, put his
hands upon the chair-arms as before,
and, as she looked at him entranced,
added, Maman, cant I have the sword
now?~
	By what strange primitive instinct did
he interpret meanings, and by his in-
fant logic come into line with her own
thoughts and purposes?
	You shall have the sword some day,
she answered, her eyes flashing.
	But, maman, cant I touch it now?
	Without a word, she took down the
sheathed gold-handled sword and laid it
across the chair-arms in front of the
child.
	I cant take the sword out, can I,
maman? he asked.
	She could not help smiling. Not
yet, my son, not yet.
	I has to be growed up, so the blade
does nt hurt me, has nt I, maman?
	She nodded, and smiled again. Pre-
sently she said to him, Guilbert, if I let
you have the sword, will you stay here
alone with Biribi till I come back?
	He nodded his head sagely. Ma</PB>

man! he called, as she was about to
go. She turned to him; the little fig-
ure was erect with a sweet importance.
Maman, what am I now? he asked,
with wide-open, amazed eyes.
	A strange look passed across her face.
She went over to him, and, stooping,
kissed his curly hair.
	You are my prince.
	He did not reply to that, but his eyes
blinked as though he were trying to work
it out in his own mind.

	A little later Guida was standing on
that point of land called Grosnez,  the
brow of the Jersey tiger. Not far from
her was the signal - staff which tele-
graphed to another signal - staff inland.
Upon the staff now was hoisted a red
flag. She knew the signals well; the
red flag meant men-of-war in sight. Then
bags were hoisted that told the number
of vessels: one, two, three, four, five,
six; then one next the upright, meaning
seven. Last of all came the signal for
a flagship among them.
	This was a fleet in command of an
admiral. There, far out, between Guern-
sey and Jersey, was the squadron itself.
She watched it for a little while, her
heart hardening; then, turning, she went
back to the hut, for she saw that the
men by the signal-staff were watching
her. But presently she came out again
with the child, and, in a spot where she
was shielded from any eyes on the land
or on ships at sea, she watched the fleet
draw nearer and nearer.
	The vessels passed almost within a
stones throw of her. She could see the
flag, the St. Georges cross, flying at the
main of the largest ship. That was the
admirals flag; that was the flag of Ad-
miral Prince Philip dAvranche, Duc de
Bercy!
	She felt her heart stand still, and with
a tremor, as of fear, she gathered the
child close to her.
	What is all those ships, maman?
asked the boy.
	They are the ships to defend the
island of Jersey, she replied, watching
the Imperturbable and its flotilla range
on.
	Will they affend us, maman?
	Perhaps,  in the end, she said;
but still the answer was not wholly in-
tended for the child.


XXXVI.

	Off Grouville Bay, between the Castle
of Mont Orgueil and the beautiful, ma-
lignant Banc des Violets, lay the squad-
ron of the Jersey station. The St.
Georges cross was flying at the main of
the Imperturbable, and on every ship
of the fleet the white ensign flapped in
the morning wind. The wooden-walled
three-decked Imperturbable, with her
one 68-pounder, seventy-four 32-pound-
ers, and six hundred men, was not less
picturesque, and was much more impor-
tant, than the Castle of Mont Orgucil,
standing over two hundred feet above the
level of the sea, and flying the flag of a
vice-admiral. It had become the home
of Admiral Prince Philip dAvranche,
IDuc de Bercy, and the Comtesse Chanta-
voine, now known to the world as the
Duchesse de Bercy.
	The Comtesse Chantavoine had ar-
rived in the islaiid almost simultaneously
with Philip, although he had urged her
to remain at the Chateau of Bercy. But
the duchy of Bercy was in hard case.
When the imbecile Duke Leopold John
died, and Philip succeeded, the neutrali-
ty of Bercy was proclaimed; but this
neutrality had since been violated, and
the duchy was in danger at once from
the incursions of the Austrians and the
ravages of the Republican troops. In
Philips absence, the valiant governor-
general of the duchy, aided by the in-
fluence and courage of the Comtesse
Chantavoine, had thus far saved it from
dismemberment, in spite of attempted
betrayals by the intendant, Comte Ca-</PB>

rignan Damour, who remained Philips
implacable enemy. But when the Mar-
quis Grandjon-Larisse, the uncle of the
comtesse, died, her cousin, General
Grandjon-Larisse,  whose word with
Dalbarade had secured Philips release,
years before,  for her own protection,
first urged, and then commanded her
temporary absence from the duchy. So
far he had been able to protect it from
the fury of the Republican government
and the secret treachery of the Jaco-
bins; but a time of real peril was now
at hand. Under these anxieties and the
lack of other inspiration than duty, her
health had failed, and at last she obeyed
her cousin, joining Philip at the Castle
of Mont Orgueil.
	More than a year had passed since
she had seen him, but there was no emo-
tion, no ardor, in their present greeting.
From the first there was nothing to link
them together. She had married hop-
ing that she might love thereafter; he
had married in choler and bitterness,
and in the stress of a desperate ambi-
tion. He had avoided the marriage so
long as he might, in the hope of prevent-
ing it until the duke should die; but,
with the irony of fate, the expected death
had come an hour after the marriage.
Then, within eighteen months, came~the
death of the imbecile Leopold John, and
Philip found himself the Duke of Bercy;
and not a month later, by reason of a
splendid victory for the Imperturbable,
aa English admiral.
	In this battle he had fought for vic-
tory for his ship, and a fall for himself.
Death, with the burial of private dis-
honor under the roses of public triumph,
 that had been his desire, all other
ambitions being now achieved. Bnt he
had found that Death is willful, and
chooseth his own time; that he may be
lured, but will not come with shouting.
So he had stoically accepted his fate,
and could even smile with a bitter cyn-
icism when ordered to proceed to the
coast of Jersey, where it was deemed
certain collision with a French squadron
would occur. From Mont Orgueil he
could have communication by signals
with the leaders of the Vend6e, among
whose most famous chieftains was now
Comte D6tricand de Tournay. The high
place Philip had striven for, sold his
honor for, had been granted him, and
now, with sinister amusement, Fate
threw him into alliance with the man he
hated, the heir by blood and descent to
the duchy he ruled.
	Thus, too, he was brought face to face
with his past,  with the memory of
Guida Landresse de Landresse. Look-
ing out from the windows of Mont Or-
gueil Castle or from the deck of the
Imperturbable, he could see  and he
could scarce choose but see  the lone-
ly Ecr6hos. There, with a wild elo-
quence, he had made a girl believe he
loved her, and had taken the first step
in the path which should have led to
true happiness and honor. From this
good path he had violently swerved 
and now?
	From all that appeared, however, the
world went very well with him. Almost
any morning one might have seen a boat
shoot out from below the castle wall,
carrying a flag with the blue ball of a
vice-admiral of the white in the canton;
and as the admiral himself stepped upon
the deck of the Imperturbable, the guard
under arms offered the ceremony of re-
spect, while across the water came a gay
march played in his honor.
	Jersey was elate, eager to welcome
one of her own sons risen to such high
estate; and when, the day after his ar-
rival, he passed through the Vier Marchi
on his way to visit the lieutenant-gov-
ernor, the jurats in their red robes im-
pulsively turned out to greet him. They
were ready to prove that memory is a
matter of will and cultivation. There
is no curtain so opaque as that which
drops between the mind of man and the
thing which it is to his disadvantage to
remember. But how closely does the</PB>

ear of advantage listen for the footfall of
a most distant memory, when to do so is
to share even a reflected glory!

	A week had gone since Philip had
landed on the island. There was scarce
a:n hour of that time when memory had
not pursued him, scarce a step he took
but reminded him of Guida. If he came
along the shore of St. Clements Bay, he
saw the spot where he had stood with
her the evening he married her, and she
said to him, Philip, I wonder what
we shall think of this day a year from
now ~... To-day is everything to you;
to-morrow is very much to me. He
remembered Shoreham sitting upon the
cromlech above, singing the legend of
the gui-lann6e,  and Shoreham was
lying now a hundred fathoms deep!
	As he walked through the Vier Marchi
with his officers, there flashed before his
eyes the scene of fifteen years ago, when
amid the grime and havoc of battle he
had run to save Guida from the scimi-
ter of the garish Turk. Crossing the
Place du Vier Prison, he recalled the
morning when, with his few sailors, he
had rescued Ranulph from the hands of
the mob, and Guidas face at the window
had set his pulses beating faster. How
many years ago was this, then? Only
four, and yet it seemed twenty.
	He was a boy then; now his hair was
streaked with gray. He had been light-
hearted then, and he was still buoyant
with his fellows, still alert and vigorous,
quick of speech and keen of humor, 
but only before the world. In his own
home he was fitful of temper, impatient
of the still, meditative look of his wife,
of her resolute tenacity of thought and
purpose, of her unvarying evenness of
mood through which no warmth played.
If she had only defied him, given him
petulance for petulance, impatience for
impatience, it would have been easier to
bear. If  if he could only read behind
those still, passionless eyes, that clear,
unvarying, unwrinkled forehead! Bat
he knew her no better now than he did
the day he married her. Unwittingly
she chilled him, and he knew that he
had no right to complain. He knew that
he had done her the greatest wrong
which can be done a woman; for, what-
ever chanced, Guida was still his wife.
There was in him yet the strain of Cal-
vinistic morality of the island race that
bred him. He had shrunk from coming
here, but it had proved far worse than
he had looked for.
	One day, in a nervous, bitter moment,
after an impatient hour with the com-
tesse, he had said, Can you  can you
not speak? Can you not tell me what
you think of this?~ And she had an-
swered quietly, It would do no good;
you would not understand. I know you
in some ways better than you know your-
self, but you do not know me at all. I
cannot tell what it is, but there is some-
thing wrong in your nature, something
that has poisoned your life. And not
I alone have felt that. I never told
you, but you remember the day the
old duke died,  the day we were mar-
ried? You had gone from the room an
instant. The duke beckoned me to him,
and whispered, Dont be afraid  dont
be afraid  and then he died. That
meant that he was afraid; that death
had cleared his sight as to you, in some
way. He was afraid,  of what? And
I have been afraid,  of what? I do
not know. Things have not gone well,
somehow. You are strong, you are
brave, and I come of a race that have
been strong and brave; yet  yet we are
lonely and far apart, and we shall never
be nearer or less lonely, that I know.
	To this he had made no reply. His
anger had vanished. Something in her
words had ruled him to her own calm-
ness, and at that moment he had had
the first flash of understanding of her
nature and its relation to his own. He
had simply said that time would proba-
bly give them better knowledge, and
with that he had left her.</PB>

	Passing through the Rue dEgypte
one day, in front of the house of Elie
Mattingley, the smuggler, he met Dormy
Jamais. Forgetful of everything save
that this quaint, foolish figure had inter-
ested him when a boy, he called him by
name; but Dormy Jamais swerved away,
eying him askance.
	Immediately afterward, chancing to
look up at the windows of Mattingleys
house, he suddenly felt a shiver run
through him. There were the faces of
the two men whom he least cared to see
in this world,  Ranulph Delagarde and
the Chevalier du Champsavoys. Ranulph
was looking down at him with an infinite
scorn and loathing, yet with something
of triumph, too; and there was a discon-
certing look of triumph, also, in the che-
valiers face. The triumph in both faces
was due to the fact that, but a few min-
utes before, the chevalier had shown to
Ranulph a certain page in a certain
book, long lost, which Carterette Mat-
tingley had placed in his hands.
	From this page Ranulph knew that
Guida would henceforth have stronger
champions than himself; that he might
now seek his own fate with one burden
the less on his mind; that he was free
to go forth and lose himself in the storm
of war in the Vend6e.
	Something in Ranulphs eye quickened
Philips footsteps, drove him on, angry
and confused. He bitterly reflected that
there was no one of these men but was
happier than he. He would willingly
have changed places with Mattingley, the
fugitive, who had had the hangmans
rope round his neck; with Ranulph De-
lagarde, the son of a traitor, the poor
shipwright with a broken life, whom the
people of the island now held in such ill
repute. A wave of remorse rushed over
him. If he could only turn back, even
now, and throw up all,  go to Guida,
beg her to come with him to a new life,
and begin the world again. Every sen-
tence of the letter she had written to
him at Bercy, renouncing him, he knew
only too well. The words would not
be erased from his brain, but, like some
deadly rust, ate away his pride, vain-
glory, and hypocrisy. Where would it
all end?
	Even at that moment he saw Jean
Touzel standing in the doorway of his
house. Since his return Philip had not
dared to ask about Guida, and no one
had said a word concerning her,  whe-
ther she was dead or living. He felt
now that he must know, and Jean Tou-
zel or Maitresse Aimable could tell him.
He instantly bethought him of an excuse
for the visit. His squadron needed an-
other pilot; he would approach Jean
Touzel in the matter.
	Bidding his flag lieutenant go on to
Elizabeth Castle, whither they were
bound, and await him there, he crossed
over to Jean. By the time he reached
the doorway, however, Jean had retreat-
ed to the veille by the chimney, behind
Maitresse Aimable, who sat in a great
stave chair mending a net.
	Philip knocked and stepped inside.
When Maitresse Aimable saw who it
was, she was so startled that she dropped
her work, and made vague clutches to
recover it. Stooping, however, was a
great effort for her. Philip stepped for-
ward and picked up the net. Politely
handing it to her, he said, Ah, Mal-
tresse Aimable, it is as if you had never
stirred all these years! Then turning
to her husband, I have come looking
for a good pilot, Jean.
	Maitresse Aimable had at first flushed
to a purple, had afterward gone pale,
then recovered herself, and now returned
Philips look with a downright steadi-
ness. Like Jean, she knew well enough
he had not come for a pilot; that was not
the business of a prince admiral,  that
could easily be a quartermasters work.
Maitresse Aimable did not even rise.
Philip might be whatever the world chose
to call him, but her house was her own;
he had come uninvited, and he was un-
welcome.</PB>

	She kept her seat, but her fat head
inclined once in greeting, and she waited
for him to speak again. She knew why
he had come; and somehow, the steady
look in these siow brown eyes and the
blinking glance, behind Jeans brass-
rimmed spectacles disconcerted Philip.
Here were people who knew the truth
about him,  knew the sort of man lie
really was. These poor folk, who had
had nothing of the world but what they
earned, they would never hang on any
princes favors.
	He read the situation rightly. The
penalties of his life had taught him a
discernment which could never have
come to him through place and good for-
tune. Having at last discovered his real
self a little, he was in the way of know-
ing others.
	May I shut the door? he asked
quietly. Jean nodded. Closing it, Philip
turned to them ngain. Since my re-
turn I have heard naught concerning
Mademoiselle Landresse, he said. I
want to ask you about her now. Does
she still live in the Place du Vier Pri-
son?
	Both Jean and Aimable shook their
heads. They had spoken no word since
his entrance.
	She  she is not dead? he asked,
and he paled. They shook their heads
again. Her grandfather   he paused
	is he living? Once more they
shook their heads in negation. Where
is mademoiselle? he queried, his heart
sick.
	Jean looked at his wife; neither moved
nor answered. Where does she live?
urged Philip. Still there was no mo-
tion, no reply. You might as well tell
me, he added, in a tone half pleading,
half angry,  little like a sovereign duke,
very like a man in trouble. You must
know I shall find out from some one else,
then, he continued. But it were bet-
ter for you to tell me. I mean her no
harm, and I should rather know about
her from her friends.
	VOL. LXXXII.  No. 492.	33
	He took off his hat now. Something
in the dignity of these honest folk re-
buked the pride of place and spirit in
him. As plainly as though heralds had
proclaimed it, he understood that these
two knew that upon the shield of his
honor there were abatements,  argent,
a plain point tenne, due to him that
tells lyes to his prince or general, and
argent, a gore sinister tenne, due for fly-
ing from his colors.
	Maitresse Aimable turned and looked
toward Jean, but Jean turned away his
head. Then she did not hesitate. The
voice so often eluding her will responded
readily now. Anger  plain primitive
rage  possessed her. She had had no
child, but, as the years had passed, all the
love that might have been given to her
own was bestowed upon Guida, and she
spoke in that mind.
	Oh my grief, to think you have come
here  you! You steal the best heart
in the world; there is none like her 
nannin-gia. You promise her, you break
her life, you spoil her, and then you fly
away,  ah, coward, you! Man p~the
b6nin, was there ever such a man like
you! If my Jean, there, had done a
thing as that, I would sink him in the
sea. Ah bah! he would sink himself,
je me crais. But you come back here,
oh my Mother of God, you come back
here with your sword, with your crown
 ugh, it is like a black cast in heaven
 you!
	She got to her feet more nimbly than
she had ever done in her life, and the
floor seemed to heave as she came to-
ward Philip. You come to speak to
me with soft words, she said harshly.
You shall have the hard truth from
me  moi. You want to know now
where she is. I ask where you have
been these four years! Your voice, it
grow soft and tremble when you speak
of her now. Oh ho! it has been nice
and quiet these four years. The grand-
p~the of her drop dead in his chair when
he know. The world turn against her,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00520" SEQ="0520" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="514">	514	The Battle of the Strong.
make light of her, when they know. All
alone,  she is all alone, but for one fat
old fool like me. She bear all the shame,
all the pain, for the crime of you. All
alone she take her child and go on to the
rock of Plemont to live these three years.
But you, you go and get a crown, and be
amiral, and marry a grande comtesse,
 marry, oh, je crais ben! This is no
world for such men like you. You come
to my house, to the house of Jean Tou-
zel; well, you have the truth of God, b~v
sft! No good will come to you in the
end  nannin-gia. When you come to
die, you will think and think and think
of the beautiful Guida Landresse; you
will think and think of the heart and
life you kill; and you will call, and she
will not come. You will call till your
throat rattle, but she will not come, and
the child of sorrow you gave her will not
come,  no, bidemme! Efin, the door
you shut you can open now, and you can
go from the house of Jean Touzel. It
belong to the wife of an honest man, 
maintnant!
	In the moments silence that ensued
Jean took a step forward. Ma femme,
ma bonne femme! he said in a shak-
ing voice. Then he pointed to the door.
	Humiliated, overwhelmed by the words
of the woman, Philip turned mechanical-
ly toward the door without a word, and
his fingers fumbled for the latch, for a
mist was before his eyes. With a great
effort he recovered himself. The door
opened now, and he passed slowly out
into the Rue dEgypte.
	A child  a child! he said aloud,
brokenly. Guidas child  my God I
And I  have never  known. Ple-
mont  Plemont  she is at Plemont!
He shuddered. Guidas child  and
mine!~ he kept on saying to himself,
as in a painful dream he passed on to
the shore.
	In the little fishermans cottage he
had left, a fat old woman sat sobbing in
the great chair made of barrel-staves,
and a man, stooping, kissed her twice
on the cheek,  the first time in fifteen
years. And then she both laughed and
cried.

XXXVI.

	Guida sat by the fire, sewing, Biribi,
the dog, at her feet. At a little distance
away, to the right of the chimney, lay
Guilbert asleep. Twice Guida lowered
the work to her lap, and looked at the
child on the bed, the reflected light of
the fire playing on his face. Stretching
out her hand, she touched him, and then
she smiled. Hers was an all-devouring
love; the child was everything in life to
her; her own present or future was as
nothing; she was but fuel for the fire of
his existence.
	A storm was raging outside. The sea
roared in upon Plemont and Grosnez,
and battered the rocks in a futile agony.
A hoarse northeaster ranged across the
tigers head in helpless fury,  a night
of awe to inland folk, and of danger to
seafarers. To Guida, who was both of
the sea and of the land, fearless as to
either, it was neither terrible nor deso-
late to he alone with the storm. Storm
was but power unshackled, and power
she loved and understood. She had lived
so long in close commerce with storm
and sea that something of their wild
force had entered into her, and she was
kin with them. To her, each wind was
intimate as a friend, each rock and cave
familiar as her hearthstone; and the
ungovernable ocean spoke in terms intel-
ligible. So heavy was the surf that now
and then the spray of some foiled wave
broke on the roof; but she only nodded
at that, as though the sea were calling
her to come forth, were tapping upon
her rooftree in joyous greeting.
	But suddenly she started and bent her
head as though listening to other sounds.
It seemed as if her whole body were
hearkening. Now she rose quickly to
her feet, dropped her work upon the ta-
ble near by, and rested herself against it,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00521" SEQ="0521" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="515">	The Battle of the Strong.	515
still listening. She was sure she heard
a horses hoofs. Turning swiftly, she
drew the curtain of the bed before her
sleeping child, and then stood still, wait-
ing, waiting. Her hand went to her
heart once, as though its fierce throbbing
hurt her. Plainly as though she could
look through these stone walls into clear
sunlight, she saw some one dismount,
and she heard a voice.
	The door of the hut was unlocked and
unbarred. If she feared, it was easy to
shoot the bolt and lock the door, to drop
the bar across the little window, and be
safe and secure. But no bodily fear
possessed her; only that terror of the
spirit when its great trial comes and it
shrinks back, though the brain be of
faultless courage.
	She waited. There came a knocking
at the door. She did not move from
where she stood.
	Come in, she said in a clear voice.
She was composed and resolute now.
	As the latch clicked the door opened,
and a cloaked figure entered, the shriek
of the storm behind. The door closed.
The intruder took a step forward; his
hat came off; the cloak was loosed and
dropped upon the floor. Guidas pre.
monition had been right: it was Philip.
	She did not speak. A stone could
have been no colder, as she stood in the
light of the fire and the crasset, her won-
derful hair burnished by the flames, her
face still and strong, the eyes darkling,
luminous. There was on her the dig-
nity of the fearless, the pure in heart.
	Guida! Philip said, took a step
nearer, and paused.
	He was haggard; he had the look of
one who had come upon a desperate er-
rand. When she did not answer, he
went on pleadingly, Guida, wont you
speak to me?
	Prince Philip dAvranche chooses a
strange hour for his visit, she returned
quietly.
	But see, he said hurriedly, what
I have to say to you. He paused, as
though to choose the thing he should
say first.
	You can say nothing I need hear,
she answered, looking him steadily in
the eyes.
Ab, Guida, he cried, disconcerted
by her cold composure, for Gods sake,
listen to me! To-night we have to face
our fate. To-night you have to say 
Fate was faced long ago. I have
nothing to say.~~
Guida, I have repented of all. I have
come now only to speak honestly of the
wrong I did you. I have come to 
Scorn sharpened her words, though
she spoke calmly: You have forced
yourself upon a womans presence, 
and at this hour!
I chose the only hour possible, he
said quickly. Ah, Guida, the past
cannot be changed, but we have the
present and the future still. I have not
come to justify myself, but to find a way
to atone 
No atonement is possible.
You cannot deny me the right to
confess to you that 
To you denial should not seem hard
usage, she answered slowly, and con-
fession should have witnesses if  
She paused suggestively. The impu-
tation that of all men he had the least
right to resent denial; that his present
course was dishonest; that he was will-
ing to justify her privately, though not
publicly; that repentance should have
been open to the world,  it all stung
him.
	He threw out his hands in a gesture
of protest and pleading. As many
witnesses as you will, but not now, not
this hour, after all these years. Will
you not at least listen to me, and then
judge and act? Will you not hear me,
Guida?
	She had not yet even stirred. Now
that it had come, this scene was all so
different from what she had ever ima-
gined. But she spoke out of a merci-
less understanding, an unchangeable hon</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00522" SEQ="0522" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="516">	516	The Battle of the Strong.
esty. Her words came clear and piti-
less: If you will speak to the point and
without a useless emotion, I will try to
listen. Common kindness should have
prevented this intrusion  by you!
	Every word she said was like a whip-
lash across his face. A devilish light
leaped into his eyes, but it faded as quick-
ly as it came.
	After to-night, to the public what
you will, he repeated, with dogged per-
sistence, but it was right we should
speak alone to each other at least this
once,  before the open end. I did you
wrong, yet I did not mean to ruin your
life, and you should know that. I ought
not to have married you secretly,  I
acknowledge that. But I loved you!
	She shook her head, and, with a smile
of pitying disdain,  he could so little
see the real truth, his real misdemeanor,
 she said, Oh no, never,  never!
You were not capable of love; you never
knew what it means. From the first you
were too untrue ever to love a woman.
There was a great fire of emotion; you
saw shadows on the wall, and you fell
in love with them. That was all.
	I tell you that I loved you, he an-
swered, with passionate energy. But
as you will. Let it be that it was not
real love: at least it was all there was
in me to give. I never meant to desert
you. Ii never meant to disavow our
marriage. I denied you, you will say.
I did. In the light of what came after,
it was dishonorable,  I grant that; but
I did it at a crisis and for the fulfillment
of a great ambition, and as much for you
as for me.
	Oh, bow little you know what true
people think or feel!  she exclaimed,
with a kind of pain in her voice, and as
much scorn, for she felt that such a na-
ture could never quite realize its own
enormities. Well, since it had gone so
far, she would speak openly, though it
hurt her sense of self-respect. She had
hoped never to speak with him upon the
past.
	Do you think that I or any good
woman would have had place or power,
been princess or duchess, at the price?
What sort of mind have you? She
looked him straight in the eyes. Put
it in the clear light of right and wrong,
it was knavery. You  you talk of not
meaning to do me harm, Monsieur le
Prince! You were never capable of
doing me good. It was not in you.
From first to last you are untrue. Were
it otherwise, were you not from first to
last unworthy, would you have made
a mock marriage  it is no more 
with the Comtesse Chantavoine? INo
matter what I said or what I did in an-
ger or contempt of you, had you been an
honest man you would not have made
this mock marriage, and ruined another
life. Marriage, alas! You have wronged
the comtesse more deeply than you have
wronged me. One day I shall be right-
ed, but what can you say or do to right
her wrongs? Her voice had now a
piercing indignation and force. Yes,
Philip dAvranche, it is as I say. The
world turned against me because of you;
I have been shamed and disgraced.
For years I have suffered in silence.
But I have waited without fear for the
end. God is ~vith me to justify and to
set right. He is stronger than fate or
fortune. He has brought you to Jersey
once more, to right my wrongs,  mine
and my childs.
	She saw his eyes flash to the little
curtained bed. They both stood silent
and still. He could hear the child
breathing. His blood quickened. An
impulse seized him. He took a step to-
ward the bed as though to draw the
curtain, but she quickly moved between.
	Never! she said in a low, stern
tone; no touch of yours for my Guil-
bert,  for my son! Every minute of
his life has been mine. He is mine, 
all mine,  and so he shall remain.
	It was as if the outward action of life
was suspended in them for a moment,
and then came the battle of two strong</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00523" SEQ="0523" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="517">	The Battle of the Strong.	517

spirits: the struggle of fretful and in-
dulged egotism, the impulse of a vigor-
ous temperament, against a deep moral
force, a high purity of mind and con-
science, and the invincible love of the
mother for the child. Time, bitterness,
and power had hardened Philips mind,
and his long-restrained emotions, break-
ing loose now, made him a passionate
and willful figure. His force lay in the
very unruliness of his spirit, hers in the
perfect command of her moods and
emotions. Well equipped by the thoughts
and sufferings of four long years, her
spirit was trained to meet this onset with
wisdom and understanding. She under-
stood him,  his nature, if not his deeds.
They were like two armies watching
each other across a narrow stream, be-
tween one conflict and another.
	The only sounds in the room were the
whirring of the fire in the chimney and
the childs breathing. At last Philips
intemperate self-will gave way. There
was no withstanding that cold, still face,
that unwavering eye. Only brutality
could go further. The nobility of her
nature, her inflexible straightforward-
ness, came upon him with such force
that his mood changed. It appeared to
him once again as if all his world lay
here before him. Dressed in molleton,
with no adornment save the glow of a
perfect health, she seemed at this moment
the one being on earth worth living and
earing for. What had he got for all the
wrong he had done her? Nothing.
Come what might, there was one thing
that he could yet do, and even as the
thought possessed him he spoke.
	Guida, he said, with rushing emo-
tion, it is not too late. Forgive the
past,  the wrong of it, the shame of it.
You are my wife; nothing can undo that.
The other woman,  she is not my wife.
If we part and never meet again, she
will suffer no more than she suffers to
go on with me. She has never loved
me, nor I her. Ambition did it all, and
of ambition God knows I have had
enough! Let me proclaim our mar-
riage; let me come back to you. Then,
happen what will, for the rest of our
lives I will try to atone for the wrong
I did you. I want you; I want our
child. I want to win your love again.
I cant wipe out what I have done, but
I can put you right before the world, I
can prove to you that I set you above
place and ambition. If you shrink from
doing it for me, do it  he glanced
toward the bed  do it for our child.
To-morrow, to-morrow it shall be, if you
will forgive. To - morrow let us start
again.
	She did not answer at once; but at
last, unmoved, she said, Giving up
place and ambition would prove nothing
now. It is easy to repent when our
pleasures have palled. I told you in a
letter, four years ago, that your protests
came too late. They are always too
late. ~With a nature like yours nothing
is sure or lasting; everything changes
with the mood. It is different with
me: I only speak what I truly mean.
Believe me, for I tell you the truth, you
are a man whom a woman could forget,
but could never forgive. As a prince
you are much better than as a plain man,
for prin~es may do what other men may
not. It is their way to take all, and give
nothing. You should have been born a
prince; then all your actions would have
seemed natural. Yet now you must re-
main a prince, for what you got at such
a price to others you must pay for. You
say you would come down from your
high place, you would give up your
worldly honors, for me. What mad-
ness! You are not the kind of man
with whom a woman could trust herself
in the troubles and changes of life. If
I would have naught of your honors and
your duchy long ago, do you think I
would now share a disgrace from which
you could never rise ? For in my heart
I feel that this remorse is but caprice.
It is to-day; it may not  will not  be
to-morrow.</PB>

	You are wrong, you are wrong. I
am honest with you now, he broke in.
	No, Philip dAvranche, she an-
swered coldly, it is not in you to be
honest. Your words have no ring of
truth in my ears, for the note is the same
that I heard once upon the Ecr6hos.
I was a young girl then, and I believed;
I am a woman now, and I should still
disbelieve though all the world were on
your side to tell me I was wrong. I tell
you,  her voice rose again; it seemed
to catch the note of freedom and
strength of the storm without,  I tell
you, I will still live as my heart and
conscience prompt me. The course I
have set for myself I will follow; the
life I entered upon when my child was
born I will not leave. No word you
have said has made my heart beat fast-
er. You and I can never have anything
to say to each other in this life, beyond
 her voice changed, she paused  be-
yond one thing. Going to the bed
where the child lay, she drew the cur-
tain softly, and pointing she said,
There is my child. I have set my
life to the one task, to keep him to my-
self, and yet to win for him the heritage
of the dukedom of Bercy. You shall
yet pay to hini the price of your wrong-
doing.
	She drew back slightly, so that he
could see the child lying with his rosy
face half buried in the pillow, the little
hand lying like a flower upon the cov-
erlet.
	Once more, with a passionate exclama-
tion, he made a step nearer to the child.
	No farther! she said in a voice
of command, stepping between. When
she saw the wild impulse in his face
to thrust her aside, she added, It is
only the shameless coward who strikes
the dead! You had a wife,  Guida
dAvranche; but Guida dAvranche is
dead. There only lives the mother of this
child, Guida Landresse de Landresse.
She drew herself up, and looked at him
with scorn, almost with hatred. Had he
touched her  but she would rather pity
than loathe!
	Her words roused all the devilry in
him. The face of the child had sent him
mad.
	By Heaven, I will have the child, 
I will have the child! he said harshly.
You shall not treat me like a dog.
You know well I would have kept you
as my wife, but your narrow pride, your
unjust anger, threw me over. You have
wronged me. I tell you, you have
wronged me, for you kept the secret of
the child from me all these years!
	The whole world knew! she cried
indignantly.
	I will break your pride! he said,
incensed and unable to command him-
self. Mark you, I will break your
pride. And I will have my child, too!
	Establish to the world your right to
him, she answered keenly. You, shall
have the right, but the possession shall
be mine.
	He was the picture of impotent anger
and despair. It was the irony of pen-
alty that the one person in the world
who could really sting him was this un-
acknowledged, almost unknown woman.
She was the only human being who had
power over him, who could shatter his
egotism and resolve him into the com-
mon elements of a base manhood. Of
little avail his eloquence now! He had
cajoled a sovereign dukedom out of an
aged and fatuous prince; he had cajoled
a wife, who yet was no wife, from
among the highest of a royal court; he
had cajoled success from fate by a valor
informed with vanity and ambition;
years ago, with eloquent arts he had ca-
joled a young girl into a secret marriage.
But he could no longer cajole the wo-
man who was his one true wife. She
knew him through and through.
	He was so wild with rage that he could
almost have killed her, as she stood there,
one hand stretched out as though to pro-
tect the child, the other pointing to the
door.</PB>

	He seized his hat and cloak, and laid
his hand upon the latch; then sudden-
ly turned to her. A dark project came
to him. He himself could not prevail
with her, but he would reach her yet
through the child! If the child were
his, Guida would come to him.
	Remember, I will have the child!
he said, his face black with evil purpose.
	She did not deign reply, but stood
fearless and still, as, throwing open the
door, he rushed out into the night.
	She listened until she heard his
horses hoofs upon the rocky road of the
upland. Then she went to the door,
locked it and barred it. Turning, she
ran to the bed, with a cry as of hungry
love. Crushing the child to her bosom,
she buried her face in his brown curls.
	My son, my own darling son!
Gilbert Parker.

REMINISCENCES OF AN ASTRONOMER.

III.

	WE spent most of the winter of 1870
71 in Berlin, patiently waiting for the
end of the Franco-Prussian war, in order
that I might rummage among the old
manuscripts of the Paris observatory.
Delaunay was then director of that insti-
tution, having succeeded Leverrier when
the emperor removed the latter from his
position. I had for some time kept up
an occasional correspondence with De-.
launay, and while in England, the au-
tumn before, had forwarded a message
to him, through the Prussian lines, by
the good offices of the London Legation
and Mr. Washburn. He was therefore
quite prepared for our arrivaL We took
the first train which was likely to go
through to Paris. The evacuation of a
country by a hostile army is rather a
slow process, so that the German troops
were met everywhere on the road, even
in France. They had left Paris just be-
fore we arrived; but the French nation-
al army was not there, the Communists
having taken possession of the city as
fast as the Germans withdrew. As we

	He seized his hat and cloak, and laid
his hand upon the latch; then sudden-
ly turned to her. A dark project came
to him. He himself could not prevail
with her, but he would reach her yet
through the child! If the child were
his, Guida would come to him.
	Remember, I will have the child!
he said, his face black with evil purpose.
	She did not deign reply, but stood
fearless and still, as, throwing open the
door, he rushed out into the night.
	She listened until she heard his
horses hoofs upon the rocky road of the
upland. Then she went to the door,
locked it and barred it. Turning, she
ran to the bed, with a cry as of hungry
love. Crushing the child to her bosom,
she buried her face in his brown curls.

REMINISCENCES OF AN ASTRONOMER.

III.

	WE spent most of the winter of 1870
71 in Berlin, patiently waiting for the
end of the Franco-Prussian war, in order
that I might rummage among the old
manuscripts of the Paris observatory.
Delaunay was then director of that insti-
tution, having succeeded Leverrier when
the emperor removed the latter from his
position. I had for some time kept up
an occasional correspondence with De-.
launay, and while in England, the au-
tumn before, had forwarded a message
to him, through the Prussian lines, by
the good offices of the London Legation
and Mr. Washburn. He was therefore
quite prepared for our arrivaL We took
the first train which was likely to go
through to Paris. The evacuation of a
country by a hostile army is rather a
slow process, so that the German troops
were met everywhere on the road, even
in France. They had left Paris just be-
fore we arrived; but the French nation-
al army was not there, the Communists
having taken possession of the city as
fast as the Germans withdrew. As we
passed out of the station, the first object
to strike our eves was a flaming poster
addressed to Citoyens, and containing
one of the manifestoes which the Commu-
nist government was continually issuing.
	Of course we made an early call on
Mr. Washburn. His career in Paris
was one of the triumphs of diplomacy;
he had cared for the interests of German
subjects in Paris in such a way as to earn
the warm recognition both of the em-
peror and of Bismarck, and at the same
time had kept on such good terms with
the French as to be not less esteemed by
them. He was surprised that we had
chosen such a time to visit Paris ; but I
told him the situation, the necessity of
my early return home, and my desire to
make a careful search in the records of
the Paris observatory for observations
made two centuries ago. He advised us
to take up our quarters as near to the
observatory as convenient, in order that
we might not have to pass through the
portions of the city which were likely to
be the scenes of disturbance.
	We were received at the observatory
with a warmth of welcome that might
be expected to accompany the greeting
of the first foreign visitor, after a siege
of six months. Yet a tinge of sadness
in the meeting was unavoidable. De-
launay immediately began lamenting the

spoiled of two of its provinces by a  or-
eign foe, condemned to pay an enormous
subsidy in addition, and now the scene
of an internal conflict the end of which
no one could foresee.
	The old records I wished to consult
were placed at my disposal, with full lib-
erty not only to copy, but to publish
anything of value I could find in them.
The mine proved rich beyond the most
sanguine expectation. After a little pro-
specting, I found that the very observa-
tions I wanted had been made in great
numbers by the Paris astronomers, both
at the observatory and at other points in
the city. Some explanation of the work
I was engaged in may not be devoid of
interest, but it necessitates talking a little
astronomy.
	Millions of stars, visible with large tele-
scopes, are scattered over the heavens;
tens of thousands are bright enough to
be seen with small instruments, and sev-
eral thousand are visible to any ordina-
ry eye. The moon performs a monthly
course around the heavens, at a distance
from us which is very small compared
with that of the stars; consequently, she
often passes over a star, and of course
hides it from view during the time re-
quired for the passage. The great ma-
jority of stars are so small that their
light is obscured by the effulgence of
the moon as the latter approaches them.
But quite frequently the star passed over
is so bright that the exact moment when
the moon reaches it can be observed with
the utmost precision. The star then dis-
appears from view in an instant, as if its
light were suddenly and absolutely ex-
tinguished. This is called an occulta-
tion. If the moment at which the dis-
appearance takes place is observed, we
know that at that instant the apparent
angle between the centre of the moon and
the star is equal to the moons semi-dia-
meter. By the aid of a number of such
observations, the path of the moon in the
heavens, and the time at which she ar-
rives at each point of the path, can be
determined. From the tables of the
moons motion, assuming them to be cor-
rect, the time of each occultation, as seen
from any known station, can be predict-
ed. If the predicted and the observed
moments agree, the tables are correct.
If they do not, the discrepancy will en-
able us to determine the error in the
moons predicted position. In order that
the determination may be of sufficient
scientific precision, the time of the occul-
tation must be known within one or two
seconds; otherwise, we shall be in doubt
how much of the discrepancy may be due
to the error of the observation, and how
much to the error of the tables.
	Occultations of some bright stars, such
as Aldebaran and Antares, can be ob-
served by the naked eye; and yet more
easily can those of the planets be seen.
It is therefore a curious historic fact that
there is no certain record of an actual
observation of this sort having been made
until after the commencement of the sev-
enteenth century. Even then the obser-
vations were of little or no use, because
astronomers could not determine their
time with sufficient precision. It was
not till after the middle of the century,
when the telescope had been made part
of astronomical instruments for finding
the altitude of a heavenly body, and after
the pendulum clock had been invented
by lluyghens, that the time of an occul-
tation could be fixed with the required
exactness. Thus it happens that from
1640 to 1670 somewhat coarse observa-
tions of the kind are available, and af-
ter the latter epoch those made by the
French astronomers become quite com-
parable with the modern ones in preci-
sion.
	And how, the reader may ask, did it
happen that these observations were not
published by the astronomers who made
them? Why should they have lain un-
used and forgotten for two hundred
years? The answer to these questions
is made plain enough by an examination
of the records. The astronomers had no</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00527" SEQ="0527" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="521">	Reminiscences of an Astronomer.	521

idea of the possible usefulness and value
of what they were recording. So far as
we can infei~ from their work, they made
the observations merely because an oc-
cultation was an interesting thing to see;
and they were men of sufficient scientific
experience and training to have acquired
the excellent habit of noting the time at
which a phenomenon was observed. But
they were generally satisfied with simply
putting down the clock time. How they
could have expected their successors to
make any use of such a record, or whe-
ther they had any expectations on the sub-
ject, we cannot say with confidence. It
will be readily understood that no clocks
of the present time (much less those of
two hundred years ago) run with such
precision that the moment read from the
clock is exact within one or two seconds.
The modern astronomer does not pretend
to keep his clock correct within less than
a minute; he determines by observation
how far it is wrong, on each date of ob-
servation, and adds so much to the time
given by the clock, or subtracts it, as the
case may be, in order to get the correct
moment of true time. In the case of
the French astronomers, the clock would
frequently be fifteen minutes or more in
error, for the reason that they used ap-
parent time, instead of mean time as we
do. Thus when, as was often the case,
the only record found was that, at a
certain hour, minute, and second, by a
certain clock, une 6toile se cache par
la lune, a number of very difficult pro-
blems were presented to the astronomer
who was to make use of the observations
two centuries afterward. First of all, he
must find out what the error of the clock
was at the designated hour, minute, and
second; and for this purpose he must
reduce the observations made by the ob-
server in order to determine the error.
But it was very clear that the observer
did not expect any successor to take this
trouble, and therefore did not supply him
with any facilities for so doing. He did
not even describe the particular instru
ment with which the observations were
made, but only wrote down certain fig-
ures and symbols, of a more or less
hieroglyphic character. It needed much
comparison and examination to find out
what sort of an instrument was used,
how the observations were made, and
how they should be utilized for the re-
quired purpose.
	Generally the star which the moon hid
was mentioned, but not in all cases. If
it was not, the identification of the star
was a puzzling problem. The only way
to proceed was to calculate the apparent
position which the centre of the moon
must have held to an observer at the
Paris observatory, at the particular hour
and minute of the observation. A star
map was then taken; the points of a pair
of dividers were separated by the length
of the moons radius, as it would appear
on the scale of the map; one point of the
dividers was put into the position of the
moons centre on the map, and with the
other a circle was drawn. This circle
represented the outline of the moon, as
it appeared to the observer at the Paris
observatory, at the hour and minute in
question, on a certain day in the seven-
teenth century. The star should be found
very near the circumference of the circle,
and in nearly all cases a star was there.
	Of course all this could not be done
on the spot. What had to be done was
to find the observations, study their rela-
tions and the method of making them,
and copy everything that seemed neces-
sary for working them up. This took
some six weeks, but the material I car-
ried away proved the greatest find I ever
made. Three or four years were spent
in making all the calculations I have de-
scribed. Then it was found that seven-
ty-five years were added, at a single step,
to the period during which the history
of the moons motion could be written.
Previously, this history was supposed to
commence with the observations of Brad-
ley, at Greenwich, about 1750; now it
was extended back to 1675, and with a</PB>

less degree of accuracy thirty years far-
ther still. Hansens tables were found
to deviate from the truth, in 1675 and
subsequent years, to a surprising extent;
but the cause of the deviation is not en-
tirely unraveled even now.
	During the time I was doing this work,
Paris was under the reign of the Com-
mune and besieged by the national forces.
The studies had to be made within hear-
ing of the besieging guns; and I could
sometimes go to a window and see flashes
of artillery from one of the fortifications
to the south. Nearly every day I took
a walk through the town, occasionally
as far as the Arc de Triomphe. The
story of the Commune has been so often
written that I cannot hope to add any-
thing to it, so far as the main course of
events is concerned. Looking back on
a sojourn at so interesting a period, one
cannot but feel that a golden opportuni-
ty to make observations of historic valun
was lost. The fact is, however, that I
was prevented from making such obser-
vations not only by my complete absorp-
tion in my work, but by the consideration
that, being in what might be described
as a semi-official capacity, I did not want
to get into any difficulty that would have
compromised the position of an official
visitor. I should not deem what we saw
worthy of special mention, were it not
that it materially modifies the impres-
sions commonly given by writers on the
history of the Commune. What an his-
torian says may be quite true, so far as
it goes, and yet may be so far from the
whole truth as to give the reader an in-
correct impression of the actual course of
events. The violence and disease which
prevail in the most civilized country in the
world may be described in such terms
as to give the impression of a barbarous
community. The murder of the Arch-
bishop of Paris and of the hostages show
how desperate were the men who had
seized power, yet the acts of these men
constitute but a small part of the history
of Paris during that critical period.
What one writes at the time is free
from the suspicion that may attach to
statements not recorded till many years
after the events to which they relate.
The following extract from a letter which
I wrote to a friend, the day after my ar-
rival, may therefore not be devoid of in-
terest 
DEAR CHARLIE,  Here we are, on

this slumbering volcano. Perhaps you
will hear of the burst-up long before you
get this. We have seen historic objects
which fall not to the lot of every genera-
tion, the barricades of the Paris streets.
As we were walking out this morning,
the pavement along one side of the street
was torn up for some distance, and used
to build a temporary fort. Said fort
would be quite strong against musketry
or the bayonet; but with heavy shot
against it, I should think it would be far
worse than nothing, for the flying stones
would kill more than the balls.
	The streets are placarded at every
turn with all sorts of inflammatory ap-
peals, and general orders of the Comit6
Central or of the Commune. One of the
first things I saw last night was a large
placard beginning Citoyens! Among
the orders is one forbidding any one from
placarding any orders of the Versailles
government, under the severest penal-
ties; and another threatening with in-
stant dismissal any official who shall re-
cognize any order issuing from the said
government.
	I must do all hands the justice to say
that they are all very well behaved.
There is nothing like a mob anywhere,
so far as I can find. I consulted my map
this morning, right alongside the barri-
cade and in full view of the builders,
without being molested, and wife and I
walked through the insurrectionary dis-
tricts without being troubled or seeing
the slightest symptoms of disturbance.
The stores are all open, and every one
seems to be buying and selling as usual.
In all the caf6s I have seen, the habitu6s</PB>

seem to be drinking their wine just as
coolly as if they had nothing unusual on
their minds.

	From this date to that of our depart-
ure I saw nothing suggestive of violence
within the limited range of my daily
walks, which were mostly within the re-
gion including the Arc de Triomphe, the
H6tel de Yule, and the observatory; the
latter being about half a mile south of
the Luxembourg. The nearest approach
to a mob that I ever noticed was a drill
of young recruits of the National Guard,
or a crowd in the court of the Louvre
being harangued by an orator. With
due allowance for the excitability of the
French nature, the crowd was compara-
tively as peaceable as that which we may
see surrounding a gospel wagon in one of
oua own cities. A drill-ground for the
recruits happened to be selected opposite
our first lodgings, beside the gates of the
Luxembourg. This was so disagreeable
that we were glad to accept an invitation
from Delaunay to be his guests at the
observatory, during the remainder of our
stay. We had not been there long be-
fore the spacious yard of the observatory
was also used as a drill-ground; and yet
later, two or three men were given billets
de logement upon the observatory; but I
should not have known of the latter oc-
currence, had not Delaunay told me. I
believe he bought the men off, much as
one pays an organ-grinder to move on.
In one of our walks we entered the bar-
ricade around the H6tel de Yule, and
were beginning to make a close exami-
nation of a mitrailleuse, when a soldier
(beg his pardon, un citoyen membre do
1a Garde Nationale) warned us away
from the weapon. The densest crowd
of Communists was along the Rue de Ri-
you and in the region of the Colonne
Yend6me, where some of the principal
barricades were being erected. But even
here, not only were the stores open as
usual, but the military were doing their
work in the midst of piles of trinkets cx
posed for sale on the pavement by the
shopwomen. The order to destroy the
Column was issued before we left, but
not executed until later. I have no rea-
son to suppose that the shopwomen were
any more concerned while the Column
was being undermined than they were
before. To complete the picture, not a
policeman did we see in Paris; in fact,
I was told that one of the first acts of
the Commune had been to drive the po-
lice away, so that not one dared to show
himself.
	An interesting feature of the sad spec-
tacle was the stream of proclamations
poured forth by the Communist author-
ities. They comprised not only decrees,
but sensational stories of victories over
the Versailles troops, denunciations of
the Versailles government, and even elab-
orate legal arguments, including a not
intemperate discussion of the ethical ques-
tion whether citizens who wei~ not ad-
herents of the Commune should be enti-
tled to the right of suffrage. The con-
clusion was that they should not. The
lack of humor on the part of the author-
ities was shown by their commencing
one of a rapid succession of battle stories
with the words, Citoyens! Vous avez
soif de la v6rit6!
	The most amusing decree I noticed
ran thus 
Article I. All conscription is abol-
ished.
	Article II. No troops shall hereafter
be allowed in Paris, except the National
Guard.
	Article III. Every citizen is a mem-
ber of the National Guard.
	We were in daily expectation and
hope of the capture of the city, little
knowing by what scenes it would be ac-
companied. It did not seem to my un-
military eye that two or three batteries
of artillery coild have any trouble in de-
mohishing all the defenses, since a wall
of paving-stones, four om five feet high,
could hardly resist solid shot, or prove
anything but a source of destruction to</PB>

those behind it if attacked by artillery.
But the capture was not so easy a mat-
ter as I had supposed.
	We took leave of our friend and host
on May 5, three weeks before the final
catastrophe, of which he wrote me a
graphic description. As the barricades
were stormed by MacMahon, the Com-
munist line of retreat was through the
region of the observatory. The walls
of the building and of the yard were so
massive that the place was occupied as
a fort by the retreating forces, so that
the situation of the few non-combatants
who remained was extremely critical.
They were exposed to the fire of their
friends, the national troops, from with-
out, while enraged men were threaten-
ing their lives within. So hot was the
fusillade that, going into the great dome
after the battle, the astronomer could
imagine all the constellations of the sky
depicted by the bullet-holes. When re-
treat became inevitable, the Communists
tried to set the building on fire, but did
not succeed. Then, ia their desperation,
arrangements were made for blowing it
up; but the most violent man among
them was killed by a providential bullet,
as he was on the point of doing his work.
The remainder fled, the place was speed-
ily occupied by the national troops, and
the observatory with its precious con-
tents was saved.
	The Academy of Sciences had met
regularly through the entire Prussian
siege. The legal quorum being three,
this did not imply a large attendance.
At the time of my visit a score of mem-
bers were in the city. Aniong them were
Elie de Beaumont, the geologist; Milne-
Edwards, the zo~slogist; and Chevreul,
the chemist. I was surprised to learn
that the latter was in his eighty - fifth
year; he seemed a man of seventy or
less, mentally and physically. Yet we
little thought that he would be the long-
est-lived man of equal eminence that our
age has known. When he died, in 1889,
he was nearly one hundred and three
years old. Born in 1786, he had lived
through the whole French Revolution,
and was seven years old at the time of
the Terror. His scientific activity, from
beginning to end, extended over some
eighty years. When I saw him, he was
still very indignant at a bombardment
of the Jardin des Plantes by the Ger-
man besiegers. He had made a formal
statement of this outrage to the Acade-
my of Sciences, in order that posterity
might know what kind of men were be-
sieging Paris. I suggested that the shells
might have fallen in the place by acci-
dent; but he maintained that it was not
the case, and that the bombardment was
intentional.
	But, said I, the Germans are a
scientific nation; what object could they
have had in injuring an establishment
so purely scientific as yours ?
	He replied that some explosives had
been stored in one corner of the place,
and he supposed that the Germans had
found it out. I did not pursue the ques-
tion further.
	The most execrated man in the sci-
entific circle at this time was Leverrier.
He had left Paris before the Prussian
siege began, and had not returned. De-
launay assured me that this was a wise
precaution on his part; for had he ven-
tured into the city he would have been
mobbed, or the Communists would have
killed him as soon as he was caught.
Just why the mob should have been so
incensed against one whose life was spent
in the serenest fields of astronomical sci-
ence was not fully explained. The fact
that he had been a senator, and was po-
litically obnoxious, was looked on as an
all sufficient indictment. Even members
of the Academy could not suppress their
detestation of him. He was charged
with the most despicable meanness, not
to say turpitude; and altogether, one
taking the statements with no grains of
salt would have thought him a character
that no self - respecting man could asso-
ciate with.</PB>

	Four years later I was again in Paris,
and attended a meeting of the Academy
of Sciences. In the course of the session
a rustle of attention spread over the room,
as all eyes were turned upon a member
who was entering rather late. Looking
toward the door, I saw a man of sixty,
a decided blond, with light chestnut hair
turning gray, a slender form, a shaven
face, rather pale and thin, but very at-
tractive, and extremely intelligent fea-
tures. As he passed to his seat hands
were stretched out on all sides to greet
him, and not until he sat down did the
bustle caused by his entrance subside.
He was evidently a notable.
	Who is that? I said to my neighbor.
	Leverrier.
	Delaunay was one of the most kindly
and attractive men I ever met. We spent
our evenings walking in the grounds of
the observatory, discussing French sci-
ence in all its aspects. His investiga-
tion of the moons motion is one of the
most extraordinary pieces of mathemat-
ical work ever turned out by a single
person. It fills two quarto volumes, and
the reader who attempts to go through
any part of the calculations will wonder
how one man could do the work in a life-
time. His habit was to commence early
in the morning, and work with but lit-
tle interruption until noon. He never
worked in the evening, and generally
retired at nine. I felt some qualms of
conscience at the frequency with which
I kept him up till nearly ten. I found
it hopeless to expect that he would ever
visit America, because he assured me
that he did not dare to venture on the
ocean. The only voyage he had ever
made was across the Channel, to receive
the gold medal of the Royal Astronomi-
cal Society for his work. Two of his
relatives, his father, and, I believe, his
brother, had been drowned, and this fact
gave him a horror of the water. He
seemed to feel somewhat like the clients
of the astrologists, who, having been told
how they were to die, took every precau
tion to preven&#38; it. I remember, as a
boy, reading a history of astrology, in
which a great many cases of this sort
were described; the peculiarity being
that the very measures which the victim
took to avoid the decree of fate became
the engines that executed it. The death
of Delaunay was not exactly a case of
this kind, yet it could not but bring it to
mind. He was at Cherbourg in the an-
tuinn of 1872. As lie was walking on
the beach with a relative, a couple of
boatmen invited them to take a sail.
Through what inducement Delaunay was
led to forget his fears will never be
known. All we know is that he and his
friend entered the boat, that it was struck
by a sudden squall when at some distance
from the land, and that the whole party
were drowned.
	There was no opposition to the reap-
pointment of Leverrier to his old place.
In fact, at the time of my visit, Delan-
nay said that President Thiers was on
terms of intimate friendship with the
former director, and he thought it not at
all unlikely that the latter would succeed
in being restored. He kept the position
with general approval till his death in
1877.
	The only occasion on which I met
Leverrier was after the incident I have
mentioned, in the Academy of Sciences.
I had been told that he was incensed
against me on account of an unfortunate
remark I had made in speaking of his
work which led to the discovery of Nep-
tune. I had heard this in Germany as
well as in France, yet the matter was
so insignificant that I could hardly con-
ceive of a man of philosophic mind tak-
ing any notice of it. I determined to
meet him, as I had met Hansen, with
entire unconsciousness of offense. So I
called on him at the observatory, and was
received with ~courtesy, but no particular
warmth. I suggested to him that now,
as he had nearly completed his work on
the tables of the planets, the question of
the moons motion would be the next ob</PB>

ject worthy of his attention. He replied
that it was too large a subject for him to
take up.
	To Leverrier belongs the credit of
having been the real organizer of the
Paris observatory. His work there was
not dissimilar to that of Airy at Green-
wich; but he had a much more difficult
task before him, and was less fitted to
grapple with it. When founded by Louis
XIV. the establishment was simply a
place where astronomers of the Acade-
my of Sciences could go to make their
observations. There was no titular di-
rector, every man working on his own
account and in his own way. Cassini,
an Italian by birth, was the best known
of the astronomers, and, in consequence,
posterity has very generally supposed he
was the director. That he failed to se-
cure that honor was not from any want of
astuteness. It is related that the mon-
arch once visited the observatory to see
a newly discovered cornet through the
telescope. He inquired in what direc-
tion the comet was going to move. This
was a question it was impossible to an-
swer at the moment, because both obser-
vations and computations would be ne-
cessary before the orbit could be worked
out. But Cassini reflected that the king
would not look at the comet again, and
would very soon forget what was told
him; so he described its future path in
the heavens quite at random, with en-
tire confidence that any deviation of the
actual motion from his prediction would
never be noted by his royal patron.
	One of the results of this lack of or-
ganization has been that the Paris ob-
servatory does not hold an historic rank
correspondent to the magnificence of the
establishment. The go-as-you-please sys-
tem works no better in a national obser-
vatory than it would in a business insti-
tution. Up to the end of the last cen-
tury, the observations made there were
too irregular to be of any special impor
tance. To remedy this state of things,
Arago was appointed director early in
the present century; but he was more
eminent in experimental physics than in
astronomy, and had no great astronomi-
cal problem to solve. The result was
that while he did much to promote the
reputation of the observatory in the di-
rection of physical investigation, he did
not organize any well-planned system of
regular astronomical work.
	When Leverrier succeeded Arago, in
1853, he had an extremely difficult pro-
blem before him. By a custom extend-
ing through two centuries, each astrono-
mer was to a large extent the master
of his own work. Leverrier undertook
to change all this in a twinkling, and, if
reports are true, without much regard to
the feelings of the astronomers. Those
who refused to fall into line either re-
signed or were driven away, and their
places were filled with men willing to
work under the direction of their chief.
Unfortunately, the new director was not
an adept either in practical astronomy
or in the use of instruments. His meth-
ods were far from being up to the times,
and the work of the Paris observatory,
under his direction, so far as observations
of precision go, falls markedly behind
that of Greenwich and Pulkova.
	But in recent times the institution has
been marked by an energy and a pro-
gressiveness that go far to atone for its
former deficiencies. The successors of
Leverrier have known where to draw the
line between routine, on the one side, and
initiative on the part of the assistants, on
the other. Probably no other observa-
tory in the world has so many able and
well-trained young men, who work partly
on their own account, and partly in a
regular routine. In the direction of phy-
sical astronomy the observatory is espe-
cially active, and it may be expected in
the future to justify its historic reputa-
tion.

A WIT AND A SEER.

in our generalizations about the charac-
teristics of the English race, not not-
ing, perhaps not caring to note when
the mood for generalization is upon us,
how many individuals of that race es-
cape our classification and show what
qualities they please. Under which
characteristic of that sturdy and for the
most part matter-of-fact people do we
place its extraordinary fecundity in
every kind of individual genius? Is
Shakespeare a typical product, or is he
not,  or has the race changed since the
sunny and open times of great Eliza-
beth? Is Milton more natural and na-
tive in his kind? It is not a gay nation,
nor yet is it saturnine, nor always sober.
If it sometimes laugh, it is always in
earnest. But it has produced some 
nay, a great many-- most excellent wits.
	No doubt this might be made a mys-
tery, if we chose. The great majority
of Englishmen, it is safe to say, look
upon a jest with uneasiness, and feel to-
ward an habitual jester a deep distrust.
They do not wish the things they think
about whipped into a syllabub, and they
prefer to take counsel with grave and
serious men,  as if life were all coun-
sel, and all counsel matter of logic and
calculation, with never a laugh in it any-
where. One recalls Sydney Smiths
jest to his brother. We have reversed
the law of nature, he said: you have
risen by your gravity, and I have sunk
by my levity. It deeply shocked Eng-
lishmen to find a clergyman given to
jesting. And then there was Charles
Lamb. How uncomfortable he made
most sober men! How many good men
thought him light-headed, besotted, a
sort of whimsical, irreverent, unbal-
anced child,  and what pleasure he
took in making them think so! He is
delivered of their company now. He is
read and loved in this day which is not
his own only by the juster, clearer spirits,
bred by nature to be like those who wel-
comed and relished his comradeship
while he lived. This is a large and
goodly company, and is likely always to
be, God be praised; but it is not a re-
presentative company of Englishmen,
any more than Lambs immediate com-
rades were in his own generation. You
must not demand of the ordinary man,
even of the ordinary reading man, that
he know his Lamb; and nobody is in
the least likely to think of Lamb as of
a typical English mind. You do not
feel about him as you would feel about
a French wit: ah, what a race for the
fine turn of the phrase and for the poi-

pidity the English people are unrivaled:
you 11 hear more wit and better wit in
an Irish street row than would keep
Westminster Hall in humor for five
weeks.
	Bagehot had no literary lineage be-
hind him, nor anything very unusual in
his bringing forth that would lead the
historian of letters to expect him to be
what he so delightfully turned out to be.
Upon a plain street in the quiet little
town of Langport, in the midst of Som-
ersetshire, there stands a plain but broad
and homelike house, with its threshold
upon the very footway of the street; and
here, in an upper room, Walter Bagehot
was born, on the 3d of February, 1826.
The house is the residence of the man-
ager of the Somersetshire bank whose
offices are but a few rods away upon the
same street, where it turns about toward
Glastonbury and Wells. This was the
business to which Bagehot was born.
His father, Thomas Watson Bagehot,
was vice-president of the private bank-
ing company which Mr. Samuel Stuckey
had established there in Langport in the
last century, and which had so prospered
that its branches were after a while to
be found in every considerable place in
the county,  which was, indeed, destined
to become in our own day the largest pri-
vate bank of issue in England. The
Stuckeys are still the magnates of the
little town, the owners of ample green
acres that stretch away northward and
broaden from the hill which the parish
church crowns and adorns.
	Thomas Bagehot married a niece of
Samuel Stuckey; but not before she
had seen a good deal of the large world
outside the sequestered town in which
her great son was to be born. She had
first married a Mr. Estlin, of Bristol;
and her life and companionships in Bris-
tol, that old city which had so teemed
through more than one great age with
commerce of the mind as well as with
trade in the stuffs of the Indies and the
ends of the earth, had enriched her live-
ly mind not a little in the days when
she was most susceptible. She was older
than Mr. Bagebot by a goodly number
of years,  perhaps it would be ungal-
lant to say how many,  but she was
not of the kind to grow old or stagnate,
even if she had lived all her life in that
quiet house in Langport; and her son,
Walter Bagehot, took a good measure
of genius by inheritance from her.
	Somersetshire is a sunny county, and
lies in the midst of that brightest part
of England which is thrust with its ris-
ing coasts southward toward the heart
of the Atlantic; but many dull wits are
born thereabouts. For all there is so
much poetry in the soft air, with its sun-
lit mists and its fine mysterious dis-
tances, looking toward the sea, it has
not bred many poets. Its levels of in-
telligence have in all ordinary seasons
been nearly as fiat and featureless as its
own fat interior meadows, which used
now and again to hold a flood of waters
like the sea, with only here and there an
island-hill, like that of Avalon, where
monks built their abbey of Glastonbury.
It is pleasant to see Langport also
perched upon one of these infrequent
hills, a landmark for the traveler, and
to think that it was from this haven
Walter Bagehot set out to make his bold
voyage into the world of thought,  that
high-spirited, buoyant, subtle, specula-
tive nature, in which the imaginative
qualities were even more remarkable
than the judgment, as one of his com-
rades and fellow voyagers has said, 
a man of a gay and dashing humor
which was the life of every conversation
in which he joined, and of a vi-
sionary nature to which the commonest
things often seemed the most marvelous,
and the marvelous things the most in-
trinsically probable. This was the man
who was to set the facts of English poli-
tics in their true light,  and not the
facts of English politics only, but also
many of the facts of the worlds political
development as well; for it is in the vision</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00535" SEQ="0535" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="529">	A Wit and a Seer.	529

of such men that facts appear for what
they are,  are seen to consist not sim-
ply of what is in them, but also, and
even more, of what is behind them and
about them, their setting and atmo-
sphere, and are seen not to be intelli-
gible without these. No doubt it was a
signal advantage to have had a very bril-
liant woman for his mother, as Bagehot
had,  a woman who had come to the ma-
turity of her charming gifts; and to have
had so sterling a man as Thomas Bagehot
for his father,  a man of cultivated
power, and of great good sense and bal-
ance of judgment. But brilliant women
are not always generous in giving wit to
their sons, and the best of men have be-
got fools. Neither Somersetshire air nor
any certain custom of mental inheritance
can explain Walter Bagehot. We must
simply accept him as part of the largess
of Providence to a race singularly en-
riched with genius.
	Nor is the breeding of the boy much
to our purpose. He was not made by
his breeding. His mind chose its own
training, as such a mind always does,
and made its own world of thought in
the days of his formal schooling in Bris-
tol and at University College, London,
whither he went because his father
would not have him stomach the reli-
gious tests then imposed at Oxford and
Cambridge. Schools and colleges are
admirable for drill and discipline of the
mind, and give many an ordinary man
his indispensable equipment for success;
but that is not their use for the excep-
tional mind of genius. Such a niind
does not accept their drill. It takes
only their atmosphere, needs only the
companionships they afford, uses them
with a sort of sovereign selection of
what it desires. Bagehot has given us
his own statement of the habit of such
min(ls, in an article on Oxford Reform
which he published in the Prospective
Review for August, 1852. In youth,
he says, the real plastic energy is not
in tutors or lectures or in books got up,
	vot~. Lxxxii.  NO. 492.	34
but in Wordsworth and Shelley; in the
books that all read because all like; in
what all talk of because all are interest-
ed; in the argumentative walk or dispu-
tatious lounge; in the impact of young
thought upon young thought, of fresh
thought on fresh thought, of hot thought
on hot thought; in mirth and refutation,
in ridicule and laughter: for these are
the free play of the natural mind, and
these cannot be got without a college.
These cannot be got without a college!
Here is food for reflection for those who
look to become men of thought by dili-
gence in attending lectures and thorough-
ness in getting up examinations!
No doubt Bagehot was writing thus out
of his own experience, as Mr. R. H.
Hutton says. Such minds make their
own laws and ways of life, and the rest
of us, being duller, must take care not to
use prescriptions which do not suit our
case. Mr. Hutton, who was Bagehots
college mate and lifelong friend, tells us
that youth, buoyancy, vivacity, velo-
city of thought, were of the essence of
the impression he made. Such arro-
gance as he seemed to have in early life
was the arrogance as much of enjoy.
ment as of detachment of mind; the in-
souciance of the old Cavalier as much, at
least, as the calm of a mind not acces-
sible to the contagion of social feelings.
He always talked, in youth, of his spir-
its as inconveniently high; and once
wrote to nie that he did not think they
were quite as boysterous as they had
been, and that his fellow creatures were
not sorry for the abatement; neverthe-
less, he added, I am quite fat, gross,
and ruddy. He was indeed excessively
fond of hunting, vaulting, and almost all
muscular effort; so that his life would
be wholly misconceived by any one who
	should picture his mind as a vigi-
lantly observant, far-away intelligence,
 such as Hawthornes, for example.
He liked to be in the thick of the m~l~e
when talk grew warm, though he was
never so absorbed in it as not t&#38; keep</PB>

his mind cool. He liked to talk, in-
deed, even when there was no one to
talk to but himself; for there are elder-
ly men still to be found at the bank in
Langport who remember the overflow-
ing vivacity of the banks one-time di-
rector, and recall how he could oftentimes
be overheard talking to himself in his
characteristic eager fashion, as he paced
all alone up and down the directors
room, in the intervals of business. He
was a sore puzzle to the sober citizens
of his native town, who did not know
any means of calculating what this tall,
athletic, stirring gentleman would be at
next, or what he would say in his whim-
sical humor. He was asked once (and
only once) to read a lecture to the liter-
ary society of Langport. His subject
was Reading, and he advised his amazed
hearers, amongst other things, to read
all of the Times newspaper every day,
the advertisements included. They did
not see the jest, and deemed the advice
quite as incomprehensible as the man
himself! He was as careless and as
whimsical, it would seem, as Lamb him-
self with regard to the impression he
made on most sorts and conditions of
men.
	London, it turned out, and not Som-
ersetshire, was to be Bagehots chief
place of residence. Somersetshire was
always his home, but London was his
place of work. As usual, the provinces
were to enrich the capital. Though he
first studied law for a little, Bagehot
eventually turned to the practical busi-
ness affairs which have for so many gen-
erations seemed the chief and most ab-
sorbing interest of all Englishmen. It
was, of course, the intellectual side of
business that really engaged him, how-
ever. He was something more than a
Somersetshire banker. He became ed-
itor of the London Economist, and
brought questions of finance to the light
in editorials which clarified knowledge
and steadied prediction in such fashion
as made him the admiration of the
Street. The City had never before seen
its business set forth with such lucidity
and mastery. London had taught Bage-
hot a great deal in the days when he
was an undergraduate in University Col-
lege, and he had roamed its streets,
haunted by all the memories of deeds
and of letters of which the place was so
full. Now he learned by a new sort of
companionship,  a companionship with
the men who were the living forces of
the time in business and in politics. It
is not easy to overestimate the influ-
ence of a great capital upon affairs, or
the influence of affairs upon a great cap-
ital. London, like Paris, is so much
more than a political capital. No pub-
lic man can remain long at the heart of
that vast, abounding life, or mix even
for a little in that various society, where
men of every sort of thought and pow-
er and experience and habit of reason
throng and speak their minds, without
in some way receiving a subtle and pro-
found instruction in affairs. And the
men of the city are themselves, in turn,
instructed by their acquaintance at short
range with the processes and the forces
which control in the policy and business
of the state. Such a capital as London
is a huge intellectual clearing-house, and
men get out of it, as it were, the net
balances of the nations needs and
thoughts.
	Bagehot both took and gave a great
deal in such a place. His mind was sin-
gularly fitted to understand London, and
every complex group of men and inter-
ests. He had the social imagination that
Burke had, and Carlyle,  that every
successful student of affairs must have,
if lie would scratch but a little beneath
the surface or lift the mystery from any
transaction whatever. For minds with
this gift of sight there is a quick way
opened to the henrt of things. Their
acquaintance with any individual man is
but a detail in their acquaintance with
men; and it is noteworthy that, though
they gain in mastery, they do not gain</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00537" SEQ="0537" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="531">A Wit and a Seer.

in insight by their contact with men and
with the actual business of the world.
Burke saw as clearly and with as certain
a penetration when he was in his twenties
as when he had lived his life out. The
years enriched his knowledge with de-
tails, and every added experience brought
him some concrete matter to ground his
thought upon; but the mastery of these
things was in him from the first.
	Bagehot showed the same precocious
power, and saw as clearly at twenty-five
as at fifty, though he did not see as
much or hold his judgment at so nice a
balance. There is full evidence of this
in the seven remarkable letters on the
third Napoleons Coup dEtat, which he
wrote from Paris while he was yet a law
student. They are evidently the letters
of a young man. Their style goes at a
spanking, reckless gait that no older
mind would have dared attempt or could
have kept its breath at. Their satirical
humor has a quick sting in it; their
judgments are offhand and unconscion-
ably confident; their crying heresies in
matters of politics are calculated to
shock English nerves very painfully.
They are aggressive and a bit arrogant.
But their extravagance is superficial. At
heart they are sound, and even wise.
The man s vision for affairs has come to
him already. He sees that Frenchmen
are not Englishmen, and are not to be
judged, or very much aided either, by
English standards in affairs. You shall
not elsewhere learn so well what it was
that happened in France in the early
fifties, or why it happened, and could
hardly have been staved off or avoided.
You have asked me to tell you what
I think of French affairs, he writes.
I shall be pleased to do so; but I
ought perhaps to begin by cautioning
you against believing, or too much heed-
ing, what I say. It is so he begins,
with a shrewd suspicion, no doubt, that
the warning is quite unnecessary. For
he was writing to the editor of The In-
quirer, a journal but just established for
531
the enlightenment of Unitarian dissenters,
 a people Bagehot had reason to know,
and could not hope to win either to the
matter or to the manner of his thought.
They were sure to think the one radically
misleading and erroneous, and the other
unpardonably flippant. But it was the
better sport on that account to write for
their amazement. He undertook nothing
less bold than a justification of what
Louis Napoleon had done in fiat dero-
gation and defiance of the constitutional
liberties of France. He set himself to
show an English audience, who he knew
would decline to believe it, how desperate
a crisis had been averted, how effectual
the strong remedy had been, and how
expedient at least a temporary dicta-
torship had become. Whatever other
deficiencies Louis Napoleon may have,
he said, he has one excellent ad~van-
tage over other French statesmen: he
has never been a professor, nor a Jour-
nalist, nor a promising barrister, nor by
taste a litt~rateur. He has not confused
himself with history; be does not think
in leading articles, in long speeches, or
in agreeable essays. He has very good
heels to his boots, and the French just
want treading down, and nothing else, 
calm, cruel, businesslike oppression, to
take the dogmatic conceit out of their
heads. The spirit of generalization which,
John Mill tells us, honorably distin-
guishes the French mind has come to this,
that every Parisian wants his head tapped
in order to get the formulmn and non-
sense out of it. . . . So I am for any
carnivorous government. Conscious of
his audacity and of what will be said of
such sentiments among the grave readers
of The Inquirer, he hastens in his sec-
ond letter to make his real position clear.
For the sake of the women who may
be led astray, he laughs, affecting to
quote St. Athanasius, I will this very
moment explain my sentiments.
	He is sober enough when it comes to
serious explanation of the difficult mat-
ter. Laughing satire and boyish gibe</PB>

are put aside, and a thoughtful phi-
losophy of politics  Burkes as well as
his own  comes at once to the surface,
in sentences admirably calm and wise.
In justifying Napoleon, he says plainly
and at the outset, he is speaking only of
France and of the critical circumstances
of the year 1852. The first duty of
society, he declares, is the preserva-
tion of society. By the sound work of
old-fashioned generations, by the singu-
lar painstaking of the slumberers in
churchyards, by dull care, by stupid in-
dustry, a certain social fabric somehow
exists; people contrive to go out to their
work, and to find work to employ them
actually until the evening; body and
soul are kept together,  and this is what
mankind have to show for their six thou-
sand years of toil and trouble. You can-
not better the living by political change,
he maintains, unless you can contrive to
hold change to a slow and sober pace,
quiet, almost insensible, like that of the
evolutions of husbanding ~growth. If you
cannot do that, perhaps it is better to
hold steadily to the old present ways of
life, under a strong, unshaken, unques-
tioned government, capable of guidance
and command. Burke first taught the
world at large, he reminds us, that
politics are made of time and place;
that institutions are shifting things, to be
tried by and adjusted to the shifting con-
ditions of a mutable world; that in fact
politics are but a piece of business, to be
determined in every case by the exact
exigencies of that case,  in plain Eng-
lish, by sense and circumstances. This
was a great step in political philosophy,
though it now seems the events of 1848
have taught thinking persons (I fancy)
further: they have enabled us to see
that of all these circumstances so affect-
ing political problems, by far and out of
all question the most important is na-
tional character. I need not prove
to you that the French have a national
character, he goes on, nor need I try
your patience with a likeness of it: I
have only to examine whether it be a
fit basis for national freedom. I fear
you will laugh when I tell you what I
conceive to be about the most essential
mental quality for a free people whose
liberty is to be progressive, permanent,
and on a large scale: it is much stupid-
ity. I see you are surprised; you are
going to say to me, as Socrates did to
Polus, My young friend, of course you
are right; hut will you explain what you
mean? As yet you are not intelligible.
The explanation is easily made, and with
convincing force. He means that only
a race of steady, patient, unimaginative
habits of thought can abide steadfast in
the conservative and businesslike con-
duct of government, and he sees the
French to be what Tocqueville had called
them,  a nation apt to conceive a great
design, but unable to persist in its pur-
suit, impatient after a single effort,
swayed by sensations, and not by prin-
ciples, her instincts better than her
morality. As people of large round-
about common sense will as a rule some-
how get on in life, says Bagehot, no
matter what their circumstances or their
fortune, so a nation which applies good
judgment, forbearance, a rational and
compromising habit, to the management
of free institutions will certainly suc-
ceed; while the more eminently gifted
national character will be but a source
and germ of endless and disastrous fail-
ure, if, with whatever other eminent
qualities, it be deficient in these plain,
solid, and essential requisites. It is no
doubt whimsical to call large round-
about common sense, good judgment,
and rational forbearance stupidity;
but he means, of course, that those who
possess these solid practical gifts usual-
ly lack that quick, inventive originality
and versatility in resource which we are
apt to think characteristic of the crea-
tive mind. The essence of the French
character, he explains, is a certain mo-
bility; that is, a certain excessive sen-
sibility to present impressions, which is</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00539" SEQ="0539" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="533">	A Wit and a Seer.	533

sometimes levity, for it issues in a
postponement of seemingly fixed prin-
ciples to a momentary temptation or a
transient whim; sometimes impatience,
as leading to an exaggerated sense of
existing evils; often excitement, a to-
tal absorption in existing emotion; of-
tener inconsistency, the sacrifice of
old habits to present emergencies, 
and these are qualities which, however
engaging upon occasion, he is certainly
right in regarding as a very serious, if
not fatal, impediment to success in self-
government. A real Frenchman, he
exclaims, cant be stupid: esprit is his
essence; wit is to him as water, bons-
mots as bonsbons. And yet stupidity,
as he prefers to call it, is, he rightly
thinks, natures favorite resource for
preserving steadiness of conduct and
consistency of opinion: it enforces con-
centration ; people who learn slowly
learn only what they must.
	This, which reads like the moral of an
old man, is what Bagehot saw at twenty-
six; and he was able, though a youth
and in the midst of misleading Paris, to
write quick sentences of political analy-
sis which were fit to serve both as his-
tory and as prophecy. If you have to
deal with a mobile, a clever, a versatile,
an intellectual, a dogmatic nation, he
says, inevitably and by necessary con-
sequence you will have conflicting sys-
tems; every man speaking his own
words, and giving his own suffrage to
what seems good in his own eyes; many
holding to-day what they will regret to-
morrow; a crowd of crotchety notions
and a heavy percentage of philosophical
nonsense; a great opportunity for subtle
stratagem and intriguing selfishness; a
miserable division among the friends of
tranquillity, and a great power thrown
into the hands of those who, though of-
ten with the very best intentions, are
practically and in matter of fact opposed
both to society and civilization. And
moreover, beside minor inconveniences
and lesser hardships, you will indisput
ably have periodically  say three or
four times in fifty years  a great crisis:
the public mind much excited; the peo-
ple in the streets swaying to and fro
with the breath of every breeze; the dis-
contented ouvriers meeting in a hundred
knots, discussing their real sufferings
and their imagined grievances with lean
features and angry gesticulations; the
parliament all the while in permanence
very ably and eloquently expounding the
whole subject, one man proposing this
scheme, and another that; the Opposi-
tion expecting to oust the ministers and
ride in on the popular commotion, the
ministers fearing to take the odium of
severe or adequate repressive measures,
lest they should lose their salary, their
places, and their majority; finally a great
crash, a disgusted people overwhelmed
by revolutionary violence, or seeking
a precarious, a pernicious, but after all
a precious protection from the bayonets
of military despotism. Could you wish
a better analysis of the affairs of that
clever, volatile people, and can you as-
cribe it wholly to his youth that Bagehot
should in 1852 have deliberately con-
cluded that the first condition of good
government in France was a really
strong, a reputedly strong, a continually
strong executive power?
	Henry Crabb Robinson, that amiable
man of letters and staunch partisan of
constitutional liberty, could never recall
a name, especially in his old age, we are
told; and in conversation with Mr. R. H.
Hutton he used to refer to Bagehot by
description as that friend of yours,
you know whom I mean, you rascal! 
who wrote those abominable, those dis-
graceful letters on the Coup dEtat  I
did not forgive him for years after!
 We must of course admit, with Mr. Hut-
ton, that the letters were  airy, and even
flippant, on a very grave subject; but
their airiness and flippancy were not of
the substance: they were but a trick of
youth, the playful exuberance of a lusty
strength,  the colt was feeling his</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00540" SEQ="0540" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="534">	534	A Wit and a Seer.
oats. What the critic must note is
that there is here already the vivid and
effectual style that runs like a light
through everything that Bagehot ever
wrote. Mr. Hutton tells us that Bage-
hot used to declare that his early style
affected him like the joggling of a
cart without springs over a very rough
road; and no doubt the writing of his
maturer years does often go at a more
even and placid pace. But you shall
not find in him anywhere the measured
phrases of the formal, periodic writer,
or any studied grace or cadence. The
style has always, like the thought, a
quick stroke, an intermittent sparkle, a
jetlike play, as if it were a bit of sus-
tained talk, and recorded, not so much
a course of reasoning, as the successive,
spontaneous impressions of a mind alert
and quick of sight.
	It is singular to find him preferring
the dull English way of writing edito-
rials to the sprightly, pointed paragraphs
of the French journals, as he does in the
extraordinary sixth letter on the Coup
dEtat, in which he hits off the charac-
teristics of the French press with a pcint
and truth I do not know where to match
elsewhere. We are apt, upon a super-
ficial impression, to think of Bagehot as
himself touched with a certain French
quality, and to think of his own writing
as we hear him exclaim of the French
journalists,  How well these fellows
write! - - . How clear, how acute, how
clever, how perspicuous! But he tells
us with what relief and satisfaction, af-
ter running for a little with these vol-
uble and witty fellows, he opened the
quiet columns of an English paper. As
long walking in picture galleries makes
you appreciate a mere wall, he says,
so I felt that I understood for the first
time that really dullness had its inter-
est. There was no toil, no sharp theo-
ry, no pointed expression, no fatiguing
brilliancy. He quotes an English judge
as having said, I like to hear a French-
man talk: he strikes a light, but what
light he will strike it is impossible to
predict; I think he does nt know him-
self; and he frankly confesses his own
distaste for such irresponsible brightness.
Suppose, if you only can, he cries,
a House of Commons all Disraclis! It
would be what M. Proudhon said of
some French Assemblies, a box of
matches. You cannot be with the man
long without seeing that, for all he is so
witty, and as quick as a Frenchman at
making a point, there is really no Gallic
blood in the matter. His processes of
thought are as careful as his style is
rapid and his wit reckless.
	In 1852, the very year in which the
letters on the Coup dEtat were written,
the period of Bagehots preparation in
the law w~s completed, and he was in
due course called to the bar. But he
decided not to enter upon the practice.
He had read law with a zest for its sys-
tematic ways and its sharp and definite
analytical processes, and with an unusu-
al appreciation, no doubt, of the light of
businesslike interpretation which it ap-
plies to the various undertakings and re-
lationships of society; but he dreaded
the hot wigs, the unventilated courts,
and the night drudgery which the active
practitioner would have to endure, and
betook himself instead to the less confin-
ing occupations of business. His father
was interested in large commercial un-
dertakings, and was a ship-owner as well
as a banker, and his son found, in asso-
ciation with him, an active enough
life, full of travel and of important er-
rands here and there, upon which he
could spend his energies with not a little
satisfaction. We are not apt to think
of commerce and banking as furnishing
matter to satisfy such a mind as Bage-
hots; but business is just as dull, and
just as interesting, as you make it.
Bagehot always maintained that busi-
ness is much more amusing than plea-
sure; and of course it is, if you have
mind enough to appreciate it upon all
its sides and in all its bearings upon the</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00541" SEQ="0541" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="535">	A Wit and a Seer.	535

life of society. Give a mind like Bage-
hots such necessary stuff of life to work
upon as is to be found in the commerce
of a great nation, and it will at once in-
vest it with the dignity and the charm
of a great theme of speculation and
study. Bagehots contact with business
made him a great economist,  an econ-
omist sure of his premises, and big-
minded and scrupulously careful and
guarded in respect of his conclusions.
Mr. Hutton tells us that Bagehot was
always absent - minded about minutiie,
and himself admitted that he never
could add up. He was obliged to
leave details to his assistants and sub-
ordinates. But such has often been the
singular failing of men who could never-
theless reason upon details in the mass
with an unexampled certainty and pow-
er. Bagehot turned always, it would
seem as if by instinct, to the larger as-
pects of every matter he was called
upon to handle; and had, no doubt, that
sort of imagination for enterprise which
has been characteristic of great business
men (as of great soldiers and statesmen)
in all generations. Such men can put
together colossal fortunes; but Bag~
hots career did not lead him that way.
The literary instinct was more deep-
seated and radical in him thaa the
money-making, and he found his right
place as a man of business when he be-
came editor of the London Economist.
He did not long keep to Langport. His
marriage, in 1858, brought him to the
characteristic part of his career. His
mother had urged him some time before
to marry, but he had put her off with
his customary banter. A mans mo-
ther is his misfortune, he had said,
but his wife is his fault. Whether
delay brought wisdom or not (when a
man of genius gets a wife to his mind
and need it is apt to be mere largess
of Providence), certain it is that his
marriage endowed him with happiness
for the rest of his life, and introduced
him to a new and more fruitful use of his
gifts. He married the eldest daughter
of the Right Honorable James Wilson,
who had founded the Economist, and
whose death, two years later, in India,
in the service of the government, left
Bagehot, at thirty-four, to conduct alone
the great weekly which his genius was
to lift to a yet higher place of influence.
	Mr. Hutton believes that it was Bage-
hots connection with the inner world of
politics in London to which his marriage
gave him entrance that enabled him
to write his great works of political in-
terpretation; for he was undoubtedly
the first man to strip the English con-
stitution of its literary theory, and
show it to the world as men of affairs
knew it and used it. Mr. Hutton was
Mr. Bagehots lifelong intimate, and
one hesitates to question his judgment
in such a matter; but it may at least be
said that it can in this case be established
only by doubtful inference, even though
uttered by a companion and friend. It
is not necessary for such a mind as
Bagehots to have direct experience of
affairs, or personal intercourse with the
men who conduct them, in order to com-
prehend either the make-up of politics
or the intimate forces of action. A hint
is enough. Insight and inspiration do
the rest. The gift of imaginative in-
sight in respect of affairs carries always
with it a subtle, unconscious power of
construction which suffers not so much
as the temptation to invent, and which
is equally free from taint of abstract or
fanciful inference. Somehow,  no man
can say by what curious secret process
or exquisite delicacy and certainty of in-
timation,  it reconstructs life after the
irregular patterns affected by nature
herself, and will build you the reality
out of mere inference. Bagehot may
have been quickened and assured by an
intimate and first-hand knowledge of
men and methods, but it seems like mis-
taking the character of his genius to say
that he could not have done without
this actual sight of concrete cases and</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00542" SEQ="0542" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="536">	536	A Wit and a Seer.

these personal instances of motive and
action. The rest of his work justifies
the belief that he could have seen with-
out handling.
	The power and the character of his
imagination are proved by the extraor-
dinary range it took. Most of the liter-
ary studies in which he has given us so
memorable a taste of his quality as a
critic and all-round man of letters were
written before his marriage, between his
twenty-sixth and his thirty-second years,
 the most extraordinary of them all,
perhaps, the essay on Shakespeare the
Man, in 1853, when he was but twen-
ty-seven; and there is everywhere to be
found in those studies a man whose in-
sight into life was easy, universal, and
almost unerring; and yet the centre of
life for him was quiet Langport in far
Somersetshire. His fame as a political
thinker was made later, when he was
more mature, and his imagination had
been trained to its functions by his wide
travels in the high company of the men
of genius of whom he had written.
Variety was his taste, and versatility
his power, as he said of Brougham;
and the variety of his taste and the ver-
satility of his power showed in what he
wrote of economy and of institutions no
less than in what he wrote of individual
men and books. In his English Constitu-
tion, which he published in 1867, he gave
an account of the actual workings of par-
liamentary government, so lucid, so wit-
ty, so complete, and for all so concise
and without delay about details (which
seemed in its clear air to reveal them-
selves without comment), that it made
itself instantly and once for all a part
of every mans thinking in that matter.
Everybody saw what he intended them
to see: that the English government is a
government shaped and conducted by a
committee of the House of Commons,
called her Majestys ministers; that
the throne serves only to steady the ad-
ministration of the government, to bold
the veneration and imagination of the
people; and that the House of Lords is
only, at most, a revising and delaying
chamber. The book is now a classic.
	Two years later (1869) he turned to
a broader field of thought in his Physics
and Politics, in which he sought to ap-
ply the principles of heredity and natu-
ral selection to the development of soci-
ety, showing how political organization
was first hardened by custom; then al-
tered and even revolutionized by e.hanges
of environment, and by the struggle
for existence between banded groups of
men; and finally given its nice adapta-
tions to a growing civilization by the
subtle, transmuting processes of an age
of discussion. There are passages in
this little volume which stimulate the
thought more than whole treatises writ-
ten by those who have no imagination
whereby to revive the image of older
ages of the world. Here, for example,
is his striking comment upon the nations
which, like the Chinese and the Per-
sian, have stood still the long centuries
through, caught and held fast, as he puts
it, beneath a cake of antique custom:
No one will ever comprehend the arrest-
ed civilizations unless he sees the strict
dilemma of early society. Either men
had no law at all, and lived in confused
tribes hardly hanging together, or they
had to obtain a fixed law by processes
of incredible difficulty; those who sur-
mounted that difficulty soon destroyed
all those that lay in their way who did
not,  and then they themselves were
caught in their own yoke. The custom-
ary discipline, which could only be im-
posed on any early men by terrible sanc-
tions, continued with those sanctions, and
killed out of the whole society propen-
sities to variation which are the princi-
ple of progress. Experience shows how
incredibly difficult it is to get men really
to encourage the principle of original-
ity. There is here the same thesis his
letters on the Coup dEtat had advanced,
with a sort of boyish audacity, several
years before. This is the philosophy of</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00543" SEQ="0543" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="537">	A Wit and a Seer.	537

dullness. No nation, while it is form-
ing, hardening its sinews, acquiring its
habits of order, can afford to encourage
originality. It must insist upon a rigid
discipline and subordination. And even
after it has formed its habits of order,
it cannot afford to have too much origi-
nality, or to relax its fibre by too rapid
change,  cannot afford to be as volatile
as the French. Progress is devoutly to
be wished, and discussion is its instru-
ment,  the opening of the mind; those
nations are the great nations of the mod-
ern world which have dominated the
European stage, where there is move-
inent, and the plot advances from ordered
change to change. But conservatism
and order must even yet be preferred
to change, and the nations which do not
think too fast are the nations which ad-
vance most rapidly. Bagehot speaks
somewhere of the settled calm by
which the world is best administered.
	Bagehots thought is not often con-
structive. Its business is generally ana-
lysis, interpretation. But in Physics and
Politics it is distinctly creative and arch-
itectonic. It is always his habit to go
at once to the concrete reality of a sub-
ject, lingering scarcely a moment upon
its conventionalities: he sees always with
his own eyes,  never with anothers;
and even analysis takes from him a cer-
tain creative touch. The object of his
thought is so vividly displayed that you
seem to see all of it, instead of only some
of it. But here, in speaking of ages past
and gone, his object is reconstruction,
and that direct touch of his imagination
makes what he says seem like the report
of an eye-witness. You know, after read-
ing this book, what an investigator the
trained understanding is,  a sort of ori-
ginal authority in itself. Nor is his hu-
mor gone or exiled from these solemn
regions of thought. There is an inter-
mittent touch of it even in what he says
of the political force of religion. Those
kinds of morals and that kind of religion
which tend to make the firmest and most
effectual character, he explains, are
sure to prevail in every struggle for
existence between organized groups or
nations of men, all else being the same;
the creeds or systems that conduce to a
soft, limp mind tend to perish, except
some hard extrinsic force keep them
alive. Thus Epicureanism never pro-
spered at Rome, but Stoicism did; the
stiff, serious character of the great pre-
vailing nation was attracted by what
seemed a confirming creed, and deterred
by what looked like a relaxing creed.
The inspiriting doctrines fell upon the
ardent character, and so confirmed its
energy. Strong beliefs win strong men,
and then make them stronger. Such is
no doubt one cause why Monotheism
tends to prevail over Polytheism; it
produces a higher, steadier character,
calmed and concentrated by a great sin-
gle object; it is not confused by com-
peting rites, or distracted by miscella-
neous deities. Mr. Carlyle has taught
the present generation many lessons, and
one of these is that God-fearing ar-
mies are the best armies. Before his
time people laughed at Cromwells say-
ing, Trust God, and keep your powder
dry. But we now know that the trust
was of as much use as the powder, if
not of more. That high concentration
of steady feeling makes men dare every-
thing and do anything. Is it a misuse
of the word to say that a quiet, serious
sort of humor lurks amidst these sen-
tences, and once and again peeps out at
you with solemn eyes? And there are
bold, unconventional sallies of wit in the
man as there were in the boy. Take,
for example, what he said of one of the
qualities which seemed to him very no-
ticeable in that extraordinary and very
uncomfortable man, Lord Broughain.
There is a last quality which is difficult
to describe in the language of books, but
which Lord Brougham excels in, and
which has perhaps been of more value
to him than all his other qualities put
together. In the speech of ordinary men</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00544" SEQ="0544" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="538">	538	A Wit and a Seer.

it is called devil; persons instructed
in the German language call it the
D~nmonic element. . . . It is most easily
explained by physiognomy. There is a
glare in some mens eyes which seems
to say, Beware! I am dangerous; noli
me tangere. Lord Broughams face had
this. A mischievous excitability is the
most obvious expression of it. If he
were a horse, nobody would buy him;
with that eye no one could answer for
his temper.
	With what apparent irreverence, too,
he opens his chapter on the Monarchy,
in his English Constitution! The use
of the Queen in a dignified capacity,
he begins, is incalculable. . . . Most
people, when they read that the Queen
walked on the slopes at Windsor, that
the Prince of Wales went to the Derby,
have imagined that too much thought
and prominence were given to little
things. But they have been in error;
and it is nice to trace how the actions
of a retired widow and an unemployed
youth become of such importance. And
yet he is not laughing. The best rea-
son why monarchy is a strong govern-
ment, he goes on, very seriously, is
that it is an intelligible government. The
mass of mankind understand it, and they
hardly anywhere in the world under-
stand any other. His thought turns
back to the Coup dEtat which he had
seen in France. The issue was put to
the French people, he says; they
were asked, Will you be governed by
Louis Napoleon, or will you be governed
by an assembly? The French people
said, We will be governed by the one
man we can imagine, and not by the
many people we cannot imagine. The
man is a conservative; it is only his wit
that is a radical.
	His Lombard Street is the most out-
wardly serious of his greater writings.
It is his picture of the money market,
whose public operations and hidden in-
fluences he exhibits with his accustomed,
apparently inevitable lucidity. He ex
plains, as perhaps only he could explain,
the parts played in the market by the
Chancellors of the Exchequer, whose
counselor he often was, by the Bank of
England, and by the joint-stock banks,
such as his own in Somersetshire; the
influences, open and covert, that make
for crisis or for stability,  the whole
machinery and the whole psychology of
the subtle game and business of finance.
There is everywhere the same close in-
timacy between the fact and the thought.
What he writes seems always a light
playing through affairs, illuminating
their substance, revealing their fibre.
As an instrument for arriving at truth,
one of Bagehots intimate friends once
said, I never knew anything like a talk
with Bagehot. It got at once to the
heart of a subject. He instantly appre-
ciated the whole force and significance
of everything you yourself said; mak-
ing talk with him, as Roscoe once re-
marked, like riding a horse with a per-
fect mouth. But most unique of all
was his power of keeping up anima-
tion without combat. I never knew a
power of discussion, of cot~perative in-
vestigation of truth, to approach to it.
It was all stimulus, and yet no contest.
The spontaneity with which he wrote
put the same quality into his writings.
They have all the freshness, the vivacity,
the penetration of eager talk, and abound
in those flashes of insight and discovery
which make the speech of some gifted
men seem like a series of inspirations.
He does not always complete his subjects,
either, in writing, and their partial in-
completeness makes them read the more
as if they were a body of pointed re-
marks, and not a set treatise or essay.
	No doubt the best samples of his style
are to be found in his literary and bio-
graphical essays, where his adept words
serve him so discerningly in the dis-
closure of some very subtle things: the
elements of individual genius, the mo-
tives and constituents of intellectual pow-
er, the diverse forces of differing men.</PB>

But you shall find the same qualities
and felicities in his way of dealing with
the grosser and more obvious matters of
politics. Here, as everywhere, to quote
his own language about Laurence Sterne,
his style bears the indefinable traces
which an exact study of words will al-
ways leave upon the use of words.
Here, too, there is the same illuminative
play of sure insight and hroad sagacity.
You may illustrate his method by taking
passages almost at random. The brief
description of the characteristic merit
of the English constitution is, he says,
that its dignified parts are very com-
plicated and somewhat imposing, very
old and rather venerable; while its effi-
cient part, at least when in great and
critical action, is decidedly simple and
rathcr modern. We have made, or rather
stumbled on, a constitution which 
though full of every species of incidental
defect, though of the worst workman-
ship in all out-of-the-way matters of any
constitution in the world  yet has two
capital merits: it has a simple efficient
part which, on occasion, and when want-
ed, can work more simply and easily
and better than any instrument of gov-
ernment that has yet been tried; and
it contains likewise historical, complex,
august, theatrical parts, which it has in-
herited from a long past  which take
the multitude  which guide by an in-
sensible but an omnipotent influence the
associations of its subjects. Its essence
is strong with the strength of modern
simplicity; its exterior is august with
the Gothic grandeur of a more imposing
age. He is interested to bring out the
contrast between English political ar-
rangements and our own. When the
American nation has chosen its Presi-
dent, he explains, its virtue goes out
of it, and out of the Transmissive Col-
lege through which it chooses. But be-
cause the House of Commons has the
power of dismissal in addition to the
power of election, its relation to the
Premier is incessant. They guide him,
and he leads them. He is to them what
they are to the nation. He only goes
where he believes they will go after him.
But he has to take the lead; he must
choose his direction, and begin the jour-
ney. Nor must he flinch. A good horse
likes to feel the riders bit; and a great
deliberative assembly likes to feel that
it is under worthy guidance. . . . The
great leaders of Parliament have varied
much, but they have all had a certain
firmness. A great assembly is as soon
spoiled by over-indulgence as alittle child.
The whole life of English politics is the
action and reaction between the Ministry
and the Parliament. The appointees
strive to guide, and the appointors surge
under the guidance. The English
constitution, in a word, is framed on the
principle of choosing a single sovereign
authority, and making it good; the
American, upon the principle of having
many sovereign authorities, and hoping
that their multitude may atone for their
inferiority. The Americans now extol
their institutions, and so defraud them-
selves of their due praise. But if they
had not a genius for politics; if they
had not a moderation in action singular-
ly curious where superficial speech is so
violent; if they had not a regard for
law, such as no great people have yet
evinced, and infinitely surpassing ours,
the multiplicity of authorities in the
American constitution would long ago
have brought it to a bad end. Sensible
shareholders, I have heard a shrewd at-
torney say, can work any deed of settle-
ment; and so the men of Massachusetts
could, I believe, work any constitution.
But political philosophy must analyze
political history ; it must distinguish
what is due to the excellence of the peo-
ple, and what to the excellence of the
laws; it must carefully calculate the ex-
act effect of each part of the constitu-
tion, though thus it may destroy many
an idol of the multitude, and detect the
secret of utility where but few imagined
it to lie.</PB>

GLAMOUR.

O	WONDER days when heart and I were young,
And all the world was radiant and new;
When every little common flower that grew
Interpreted to me an unknown tongue,
Or seemed a fairy bell that late had rung
Its silver peal across the morning dew;
When skies were tapestries of living blue,
And stars a mesh of jewels overhung!
Now is my happy youth fulfilled, and I
Am come to mine inheritance of pain;
Yet does the brightness of the days gone by
Still cast a glory over hill and plain;
Still can I go beneath the open sky
And feel the old world young and strange again!

AT THE TWELFTH HOUR: A TALE OF A BATTLE.

	THERE was no pause in the clamor
outside, which rose sometimes to a high-
er key, and then sank back to its level,
like the rush of a storm. Every log
and plank in the little house would trem-
ble as if it were so much human flesh
and blood, when a crash louder than the
rest betokened the sudden discharge of
all the guns in some battery. The loose
windows rattled in their wooden frames
alike before the roar of the artillery and
the shriller note of the rifles, which clat-
tered and buzzed without ceasing, and
seemed to boast a sting sharper and more
deadly than that of their comrades the
big guns. Whiffs of smoke, like the scud
blown about by the winds at sea, would
pass before the windows and float off into
the forest. Sometimes a yellow light, that
wavered like heat-lightning, would shine
through the glass and quiver for a mo-
ment or two across the wooden floor. In
the east there was a haze, a mottled blur
of red and yellow and blue, and whether
the crash of the artillery rose or sank,
whether the clatter of the rifles was
louder or weaker, there came always the
unbroken din of two hundred thousand
men foot to foot in battle,  a shuffling,
moaning noise, a shriek, then a roar.
	The widow moved the table and its
dim candle nearer the window, not that
she might see better outside, but there
she would have a stronger light on her
sewing, which was important and must
be finished. The blaze of the battle
flared in at the window more than once,
and flickered across her face, revealing
the strong, harsh features, and the hun-
dreds of fine wrinkles that crossed one
another in countless mazes, and clustered
under her eyes and around the corners of
her mouth. She was not a handsome
woman, nor had ever been, even on her
bridal morning, but she was still tall and
muscular, her figure clothed in a poor
print dress,  one who had endured
much, and could endure more. As she
bent over her humble sewing, the dim
light of the candle was reflected in hope-
less eyes.
	The battle rolled a little nearer from
the east, and the flashes of its light
grew more frequent. The trembling of
the house never ceased. On the hearth-
stone some tiny half-dead embers danced
about under the incessant rocking, like
popping grains of corn, and the windows
in their frames droned out their steady
rattle.
	But the widow paid no heed, going on
with her sewing. The battle was nothing
to her. She did not care who won; she
would not go out of her house to see. If
men were such barbarians and brutes as
to murder one another for they knew not
what, then let them. The more human
flesh and blood the war devoured, the
greater its appetite grew; for upon such
food it fattened and prospered. Her
three sons had gone to the man-eater,
gulped down, one, two, three, in the order
of their age: first the eldest, then the
second, and then her youngest, her best
beloved. She had thought that lie, at
least, who would not be a man for years,
might be left to her; but the news had
come from Shiloh, in a meagre letter
written by a comrade, that he had fallen
there, mortally wounded, and the enemy
who kept the field had buried him, per-
haps.
	She had the letter yet, but she never
looked at it. There was no need, when
she knew every line, every word, every
letter, and just how they looked and stood
on the page. The two older sons, like

expected him to become a man such as a
woman could admire, a man upon whom
a woman could depend,  that is, one
stronger than herself, and as good. He
had been both son and daughter to her,
for in that way a mother looks upon the
youngest or only son when he has no
sister; but fair hair and blue eyes and a
girl face had not prevented him from
following the others, and now she knew
not even where his bones lay, save that
the mould of a wide and desolate battle-
field inclosed them, and, in some place,
hid them.
	This woman did not cry; no tears
came from her eyes when the news of
the boys death was brought to her, and
none came now, when she still saw him,
fair - haired and white - faced, lying out
there under the sky. She had merely
become harsher and harder, and, never
much given to speech, she spoke less than
before.
	The battle rolled yet a little nearer
from the east, and the complaining win-
dows rattled more loudly. Above tbe
thud of the cannon and the unbroken
crash of the rifles she could bear now
the shouting of many men, a guttural
tumult which brought to mind the roar
and shriek of wild animals in combat.
The coming of the twilight did not seem
to diminish their ferocity, and, repeat-
ing her old formula, she said, Let them
fight on through the night, if it please
them.
	The earth rumbled and rocked beneath
a mighty discharge of artillery, the old
house shook, and the heap of coals rolled
down and scattered over the hearth. She
walked from the window and put them
carefully in place with an iron shovel.
Thrown back together they sent up little
spears of flame, which cast a flickering
light over the desolate room,  the bare
wooden floor, the rough log walls spot-
ted with a few old newspaper prints,
the two pine tables, the cane - bottomed
chairs, the home-made wooden stool, the
iron kettle in one corner and the tin pans
beside it, the low bed covered with a
brown counterpane in another corner, 
a room that suited the mind and temper
of the woman who owned it and lived
in it.

	The battle crept still closer; 4he de-
parted sun, the twilight deepening into
night, had no effect on the fury of the
combatants. Gun answered gun, and the
rifles hurled opposing showers of lead.
The difference in the two notes of the bat-
tle, the sullen, bass thunder of the cannon
with its curious trembling cadence, and
the sharper, shriller crash of the small
arms, like the wrath of little people, be-
came clearer, more distinct. Over both,
in irregular waves, swelled the shouting;
the wild and piercing rebel yell~ and
the hoarse Yankee cheer coiitending and
mingling and rolling back and forth in a
manner that would tell nothing to a lis-
tener save that men were in mortal com-
bat.
	She heard a shrieking noise, like the
scream of a man, but far louder; a long
trail of light appeared in the sky, curv-
ing and arching like a rainbow until it
touched the earth, when it disappeared
in one grand explosion, throwing red,
blue, green, and yellow lights into the air,
as if a little volcano had burst. She al-
most fancied she could hear pieces of the
shell whizzing through the air, though
it was only fancy; but she knew that the
earth where it struck had been torn up,
and the dead were scattered about like
its own pieces. Up went another, and an-
other, and the air was filled with them,
shining and shrieking as if in delight be-
cause they gave the finish and crowning
touch to the battle. She watched them
with a certain pleasure as they curved so
beautifully, and gave herself praise when
she timed to the second the moment of
striking the earth. Soon the air was filled
with a shower of the curving lights, and
then they ceased for a while.
	Still the dim battle raged in the dark-
ness. But presently a light flared up
again and did not disappear. It burned</PB>

with a steady red and blue flame that
indicated something more than the flash-
ing of cannon and rifles, and, looking
through a window-pane, the widow saw
the cause. The forest was on fire,
the exploding gunpowder having served
as a torch; the blaze ran high above the
trees, adding a new rush and roar to the
thunder and sweep of the battle. But
she was calm; for the forest did not
come near enough to place her house in
danger of the fire, and there was no rea-
son why she need disturb herself. She
blew out the candle, carefully put away
in the cupboard the piece remaining, 
economy being both a virtue and a ne-
cessity with her,  and returned to her
seat by the window, now lighted only
by the blaze of the battle and the burn-
ing trees. The light from the flaming
forest grew stronger, and flared through
the window all the way across the room.
When the flash of the guns joined it,
the glare was so vivid that the widow
was compelled to shield her eyes with
her hand; she would have closed the
shutter of the window and relighted the
candle, had there been a shutter to close.
Clouds of smoke  some light, white,
and innocent - looking, others heavy and
black  floated past the window. Such
clouds were needed, she thought, to veil
the horrors of the slaughter - yard out-
side. She looked at the little tin clock
on the mantel, ticking placidly away, and
saw that it was a quarter to ten. She
would have gone to bed, but one could
not sleep with all that noise outside and
so near. She thought it wise to take her
old seat by the window and watch the
flames from the forest, because sparks
driven by the wind might fall on her
house and set it on fire. There were
two buckets filled with water in the little
lean-to that served as a kitchen, and she
set them in a place that would be handy
in case the dangerous sparks came.
	But she did not think the water would
be needed, since the wind, though light,
was blowing the fire from her. This
was indicated clearly by the streams of
flame, red in the centre, blue and white at
the edges, which leaned eastward. The
fire had gathered full volume now, and
gave her a gorgeous spectacle, the flames
leaping far above the trees, where they
united into cones and pyramids, flashing
with many colors and sending forth mil-
lions of sparks, which curved up, and
then fell like showers of fireflies. Un-
der this flaming cloud, the cannon spout-
ed and the rifles flashed with as much
steadiness and vigor as ever. It seemed
to be a vast panoramic effect in fire
planned for her alone, after the fashion
of the Roman emperors, of whom she
had never heard.
	By the light of the fire and the battle
she saw, for the first time, some figures
struggling in the chaos of flame and
smoke. Human beings she knew them
to be, though they looked but little like
it, being mere writhing black lines in a
whirl of red fire and blue smoke. It
was a living picture, to her, of the in-
fernal regions, in which she was a firm
believer; those ghastly shapes straining
and fighting among the eternal flames.
She felt a little sympathy for the many
 mostly boys like her own boy who
had fallen at Shiloh  who were about
to pass through the flames of this world
into the flames of the next; for she had
been taught that only one out of a hun-
dred could be saved, and she never doubt-
ed it. If she felt doubt at all, it was
about the deserts of the hundredth man.
	The thunder of the cannon sank pre-
sently to a mutter and a growl, the rifles
ceased entirely, and the sudden drop in
the noise of the battle caused the fires
roar to be heard above it like a tempest.
She could still see the black figures, so
many jumping-jacks, through the veil of
flame and smoke; but they were not now
a confused and struggling heap, without
plan or order; they had drawn apart in
two lines, and for two or three minutes
remained motionless, save for a few fig-
ures which strutted up and down and</PB>

waved what looked through the fiery mist
like little sticks, but which she knew to
be long swords. She knew enough more
to guess that one line was about to charge
the other, or more likely, both would
charge at the same time, and the sinking
of the battle was but a pause to gather
strength for a supreme effort.
	She was interested, and her interest
increased when she saw the opposing
lines swing forward a little, as if making
ready for the shock. The sudden ebb
of the firing had made all other noises
curiously distinct. The ticking of the lit-
tle clock on the mantel became a steady
drumbeat. She even fancied that she
could hear the commands given to the
two lines of puny black figures, but she
knew it was only fancy.
	This silence, so heavy that it oppressed
her, after all she had heard, was broken
by the discharge of hidden batteries, so
many great guns at once that the widow
sprang up from her chair; she thought
at first that the house was falling about
her, and she clapped her hands to her
ears to shut out the penetrating crash,
which was succeeded by the fierce, un-
broken shrieking of the small arms. The
cloud of smoke at once thickened and
darkened, but she could see through it
the two lines, now dim gray images of
men, rushing upon each other. She
watched with eager, intent eyes. The
whirling smoke would hide parts of one
line for a moment, leaving it a series of
disconnected fragments ; then would drift
away, revealing the unbroken ranks
again. She could hear the ticking of
the clock no longer, for the pounding of
the guns was so terrific now that contin-
uous thunder roared in her ears, inside
her head, and seemed not to come from
anything without. A window-pane broke
under the impact of so much sound, and
the fragments of glass rattled on the floor,
but she did not take her eyes from the
battle.
	Over the heads of the rushing lines
the smoke formed in a cloud so thick,
so black, so threatening, and so low that
it inclosed them, like a roof. The old
likeness came back to the widow. It is
the roof of hell, she said to herself; these
walls and pillars of flame are its sides,
and the men who fight in there, hemmed
in by fire, are the damned, condemned to
fight so forever.
	On they rushed, some of the dim gray
figures seeming to dance above the earth
in the flames, like the imps they were, and
the two lines met midway. She thought
she could hear the smash of wave on
wave above the red roar of the guns, and
figures shot into the air as if hurled up
by the meeting of tremendous and equal
forces. A long cry, a yell, a shriek, and
a wail, which could come only from hu-
man throats, thousands of them together,
swelled again above everything else, 
above the roar of the fire, above the crash
of the rifles, above the thunder of the
cannon.
	In spite of her stoicism the watcher
quivered a little and turned her eyes
away from the window, but she turned
them back again. The cry sank to a
quaver, then rose again to a scream;
and thus it sank and rose, as the battle
surged from side to side in the flam-
ing pit. She thought she could hear
the clash of arms, bayonet on bayonet,
sword on sword, and all the sounds of
war became confused and mingled, like
the two lines of men which had rushed
so fiercely together. There were no
longer two lines,  not even one line,
 but a medley; struggling heaps, red
whirlpools which threw out their dead
and whirled on, grinding up the living
like grain in a hopper. The soldiers
fought in the very centre of the pit, and
the shifting red curtain of flame be-
tween gave them strange shapes, en-
larging some, belittling others, and then
blending all into a blurred mass, a hud-
dle of men without form or number.
	Fantastic and horrible, the scene ap-
pealed strongly to the widows hard reli-
gious sense. She could no longer doubt
544</PB>

that the red chaos upon which she was
looking was a picture of life from the re-
gions of eternal torture, reserved for the
damned, reproduced on earth for the
benefit of men. It was, then, with a feel-
ing of increased interest that she watched
the battle as it blazed and shrieked to
and fro. The thunder of the cannon
and the crash of the rifles were still as
steady as the rush of a tempest, and the
wild shouting of the men now rose above
the din, then was crushed out by it, only
to be heard again, fiercer and shriller
than before.
	The great clouds which lowered over
the pit grew blacker and bigger, and
rolled away in sombre waves on every
side. Their vanguard reached even to
her house and passed over it. The loath-
some smell of burnt gunpowder and raw
and roasted human flesh came in at the
broken window. She stuffed a quilt into
the open space, until neither smoke nor
smell could enter; but some of the drop-
pings of the black cloud, little balls and
curls of smoke, came down the chimney
and floated about the room, to remind the
woman that the whirlwind of the battle
whirled widely enough to draw her in,
too. Her throat felt hot and scaly, and
she took a gourd of water from one of the
buckets and drank it. It was cool to the
throat, and as smooth as oil. How some
of those men lying out there, helpless on
the ground, longed for water, cold water!
How her own boy, doubtless, had longed
for it, as he lay on the field of Shiloh wait~
ing for the death that came! A feeling
of pity, a strong feeling, swelled up in
her soul. She walked again across the
room and looked at the little tin clock
on the mantel. Ten forty-five! It was
time for the battle to close; it had been
time long ago.
	Then she went back as usual to the
window, and she noticed at once that
the roar and blaze of the battle were
sinking. The thunder of the guns was
not continuous, and the intervals in-
creased in number and became longer.
	vOL. LXXXII.  No. 492.	85
The fire of the rifles was broken into
crackling showers, and spots of gray
or white, where the air was breaking
through, appeared in the wall of flame.
The black roof of smoke lifted a little,
and seemed to be losing length and
breadth as the wind swept off cloudy
patches and carried them away. The
fire in the forest was dying, and she
ceased to hear the rush of the flames
from tree to tree. Once the human shout
or shriek  she could not tell which 
came to her ear, but she heard it no more
just then. The men, more distinct now
as the veil of flame thinned away or rose
in vapor, still struggled, but with less
ferocity. The groups were breaking up,
and the two lines shrank apart, each
seeming to abandon the ground for which
it had fought.
	It was nearly eleven oclock, and the
moon, able for the first time to send its
beams through the battle-smoke, was be-
ginning to cast a silvery radiance over
the field. The flames sank fast. The
fire in the forest burnt out. The great
cloud of smoke broke up into many lit-
tle clouds which drifted away westward
before the wind. The showers of sparks
ceased, and the bits of charred wood no
longer fell. A fine cloud of ashes blown
through the air began to form a film over
the window-panes.
	The battle died like the &#38; ruption of
a volcano, which shoots up with all its
strength, and then sinks from exhaustion.
The human figures melted away, and the
last was gone, though the widow knew
that many must be lying in the ravines
and on the hillsides beyond her view.
There were four cannon-shots at irreg-
ular intervals, the fourth a long time
after the third, a volley or two from the
rifles, a pop-pop or two, and the firing
was over. Some feeble flames from grass
or bush still spurted up, but they fought
in a lost cause, for the silver radiance of
the moon grew, and they paled and sank
before it.
	The ticking of the clock made the</PB>

cessation of noise outside more noticeable.
She opened the window, and the air that
came in was strong with a fleshy smell.
But so much smoke had come down the
chimney, and the room was so close, that
she kept the window open and let the
air seek every corner. Outside, the un-
burnt trees were swaying in the west
wind, but there was no other noise. The
battlefield, unlighted by the fire of cannon
and rifles, had become invisible; but she
knew that many men were lying there,
and the wind sobbing through the burnt
and unburnt forest was their dead march.
	Fine ashes, borne by the wind from
the burnt forest, still fell ; some came in
at the open window, and fell in a faint
whitish powder on the floor. The widow
took her wisp broom and brushed the
ashes carefully into the fire; but she
did not close the window, for the fresh
air which blew in had a tonic strength,
though there was still about it some of
that strange odor, the breath of slaugh-
ter.
	She resolved to watch the field a little
longer, and then she would go to bed;
she had wasted enough time watching
the struggles of lost souls. The light of
the moon was beginning to wane, and the
trees and hills were growing more shad-
owy; their silver gray was changing to
black, the sombre hue borrowed from the
skies above them. Flecks of fire like
smouldering coals gleamed through the
darkness, showing where a tree-trunk or
a bush still burned in the wake of the
battle or the fire. The wind rose again,
and these tiny patches of flame blazed
before it more brightly for a time, and
then went out. But the wind moaned
more loudly as it blew among the burned
tree - trunks and the dead branches.
Some trees, eaten through by the fire,
fell, and the night, so still otherwise,
echoed with the sound.
	All the lights from the fire went out,
but others took their place. She could
see them far apart, but twinkling like
little stars fallen to earth; probably the
lanterns, she thought, of surgeons and
soldiers come to look for those whose
wounds were not mortal. Why not let
them lie there and pay the price of their
own folly? They had gone into the bat-
tle knowing its risks, and they should not
seek to shun them. She would go to bed,
and she put up her hand to pull down
the window. She heard a prolonged
cry, a wail and a sob; distant, perhaps,
and feeble, but telling of pain and fear.
	It came direct from the battlefield.
She would have dismissed the sound, as
she had disuiissed all other signs of the
battle, but it came again and was more
penetrating. She thought that she had
no fancy, no imagination, and that the
battle had passed leaving her mind un-
touched, but the cry lingered. It rose
for the third time, louder, fuller, more
piercing than before, and the air ached
with it. She was sure now that it was
many voices in one, all groaning in their
agony, and their groans uniting in a sin-
gle lament, which rose above that of the
wind and filled all the air with its wail-
ing. She tried again to crush down her
thoughts, and to hide the scenes that she
saw with her mind, and not with her
eyes; but her will refused to obey her,
and yielded readily to imagination, which,
held back so long, took possession of its
kingdom with despotic power. Her face
and hands became cold and wet at the
sights and scenes that her fancy made
her hear and see. It was easy to turn
this field into the field of Shiloh, and her
ready imagination, laughing at her will,
did it for her. In that other battle her
boy was lying at the foot of a hillock, his
white face growing whiter, turned up to
the stars; the dead lay around him, and
there was no sound but his groans.
	She closed the window with a sudden
and violent gesture, as if she would shut
out the sight, and would shut out too those
cries which had stirred her imagination
into such life. She walked angrily to
the hearth and banked the coals for the
last time, firmly resolved to go to bed and</PB>

sleep. The clock ticked away loudly and
clearly, as if to show its triumph over
the battle, which was now gone, while it
ticked on.
	But the cry of anguish from the field
reached her there; fainter, more muf-
fled, but not to be mistaken. Whether it
came through the glass or how else, she
knew not, but she heard it,  a cry to
her, a cry that would reach her even in
bed and would not let her sleep. It was
as if her own son had been crying to
her for help, for water. She threw up
the window again, and looked toward the
battlefield. The air was filled with the
cries of the wounded like the chorus of
the lost, but of the field itself she could
see nothing. The night had darkened
fast, and the ground on which the men
had fought was clothed in a ghostly
vapor. The burnt trees were but a faint
tracery of black, and the wind had ceased,
leaving the night hot, close, and breath-
less. The fine ashes from the fire no
longer fell, and the air was free from
them, but it was thick and heavy, and
the repellent smell of human flesh lin-
gered. It was a terrible night for the
wounded. They would lie on the ground
in the close heat and gasp for air, which
would be like fire to their lungs.
	The little clock struck midnight with
a loud, emphatic tang, each stroke echo-
ing and reminding her that it was time
to go.
	The two buckets filled with water,
which she had brought to save her house
from fire, still stood by the window.
She put the drinking-gourd into one of
them, lifted both, and passed out of the
house. She was a strong woman, and
she did not stagger beneath the weight
of the water. This, she knew, was what
they would want most; for in all that she
had ever heard of battlefields the cry for
water was loudest. Yet all her pity in
that moment was for one,  not one of
those who lay there, but her own boy on
that other battlefield. She saw only him,
only his face; like a girls it had always
looked to her, with its youthful flush and
the fair hair around it. It was he, not
the others, who was taking her out on the
field, and she walked on with straight,
strong steps, because he led her.
	The mists and vapors seemed to drift
away as she approached the battlefield,
and the trees, holding out their burnt
arms, rose distinct and clear from the
darkness. The cries of the wounded
increased, and were no longer a steady
volume like the moaning of the wind;
but she could distinguish in the tumult
articulate sounds, even words, and they
were always the same,  the cry for
water rising above all others, just as she
had been told. She reached the ground
over which the fire had swept. Some
clusters of sparks, invisible from the win-
dow, lingered yet in the clefts of roots
and rocks, and glimmered like marsh
lights.
	The strange repellent odor that re-
minded her of the drippings of a slaugh-
ter-house attacked her with renewed
strength. She turned a little sick, but she
conquered her faintness and went on.
Wisps of smoke were still drifting about,
and she stumbled on something and near-
ly fell; but she saved the precious water,
and saw that her foot had struck against
a cannon - ball, which lay there, half
buried in the earth, spent, after its mis-
sion. To her eyes the earth upon it was
the color of blood, and giving it a look of
repulsion she passed on. She saw two
or three rifles upon the ground, aban-
doned by their owners; and here was a
broken sword, and there a knapsack,
still full, which some soldier had thrown
away. Under the half-burned trunk of
a tree was something dark and shape-
less, and charred like the tree; but she
knew what it was, and after the first
glance kept her head turned away. She
passed more like it, but all were motion-
less, for the fire had spared nothing over
which it had gone.
	The smell of roasted flesh was strong
here, but the silence appalled her. All</PB>

the cries came from the further part
of the field, and around her no voice
was raised. The figures, half hidden
in the dark, did not stir. The trees
waved their burnt arms, and gave forth
a dry, parched sound when a whiff of
wind struck them, like the rustle of a
field of dead broom sedge.
	She crossed the strip over which the
fire bad swept and burned out every-
thing living, and entered the red battle-
field beyond. It was lighter here, for
there were fewer trees and the moon
had cleared somewhat. She saw many
figures of men: some motionless as they
had been in the burnt woods; others
twisting and distorting themselves like
spiders on a pin; and still others half sit-
ting or leaning against a stone or a stump,
and trying to bind up their own wounds.
The cries were a medley, chiefly groans
and shrieks, but sometimes laughter, and
twice a song. She had never seen
ground so torn, for here the battle had
trod to and fro in all its strength and
ferocity. Three or four trees, cut down
by cannon - balls, had fallen together,
their boughs interlaced, and a hole in
the earth showed where a huge shell
bad burst. Some sharp pieces of the
exploding iron had been driven into a
neighboring tree, and a little further on a
patch of bushes had been mowed down
like grass in a hayfield.
	A man, shot in the legs, who had
propped himself against a rock, saw the
water that she carried, and cried to her
to come to him with it. He damned
her from a full vocabulary because she
did not make enough haste, and when
she came tried to snatch the gourd from
her hand. But with her stronger hand
she pushed his away, and made him
drink while she held the gourd. He was
young, but it did not seem strange to her
to hear such volleys of profanity from
one who had the splendor of youth, for
her older sons had been of his kind. She
left him cursing her because she did not
give him more water, and went on; for
the face of her boy was still leading her,
and the one she left was not like his.
	The field extended further than she
could see, but all around her was the
lament of after-the-battle. Lights trem-
bled or glimmered over the field; the
surgeons and soldiers holding them were
seeking the wounded, and she saw that
some wore the blue and others the gray.
Such a shambles as this was the only
place in which they could meet like bre-
thren, and here they passed each other
without comment; nor did they notice
her, save one, an old man with the shin-
ing tools of a surgeon in his hand, who
gave her an approving nod.
	She heard a moan which seemed to
come from a little clump of bushes
spared by the cannon-balls. A man, 
a boy, rather,  with the animal instinct,
had crawled in there that he might die
unseen. He was in delirium with fever,
and cried for his mother. The widows
heart was touched more deeply than be-
fore, for it was to such as he that her
boys face was leading her. She took
him from out the bushes, stanched his
wounds, and gave him of the cold water
to drink. The fever abated, and his de-
lirious talk sank to a mere mutter, while
she stood and watched until one of the
wagons gathering up the wounded came
by; then she helped put him in, and
passed on with the water to the others.
She was eager to help; it was true pity,
not a mere sense of duty, for she was
now among the boys, the slender lads of
eighteen and seventeen and sixteen;
and very many of them there were, too,
and she knew that her own boy had called
her to help these. They lay thick upon
the ground,  children they seemed to
her; yet this war had such in scores of
thousands, who went from the country
schoolhouses to the battlefield.
	Most of them were dead: sometimes
they lay in long rows, as if they had been
made ready for the grave; sometimes
they lay in a heap, their bodies crossing;
and here and there lay one who had found</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00555" SEQ="0555" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="549">At the Twelfth Hour: A Tale of a Battle.	549

death alone. But amid the dead were a
few living, and the widows hands grew
tenderer and more gentle as she raised
their heads and let them drink. The
water in her buckets was three fourths
gone, and she was very careful of it now,
for a little might mean a life.
	The vapors still hung over the field,
and the thick, clammy air was often
death to the wounded who could not
breathe it. The widow wished more
than once for a little of the water, her-
self, but there were others who needed
it far more, and she went on with her
work among the boys. She thought
often, as she looked at the white young
faces around her, of that slaughter of the
innocents of which the Bible told, and it
seemed to her that this was as wicked
and fruitless as that.
	The lights were growing fewer, and
the carts with the wounded rumbled past
her less often; the cries, a volume of
sound before, became solitary moans.
The darkness, cut here and there by the
vapors, hid most of the field, and she was
forced to search closely to tell the living
from the dead. She was tired, weary
in bone and sinew, but the face of her
boy led her on, and, while any of the
living remained there, she would seek.
She stumbled once, in the darkness, on
a dead body, and, springing back with a
shudder when she felt the yielding flesh
under her feet, walked oa into a little
hollow.
	She heard a boy groan,  very feebly,
but still she could not mistake the sound
for any of the fancied noises of the bat-
tlefield; and then the same faint voice
calling his mother. She had heard other
boys, on that night, calling for their
mothers, but there was a new tone in
this cry. She trembled and stood quite
still, listening for the groan, which came
again, feebler than before. It was so
faint that she could not tell from what
point it came, and all the shadows seemed
to have gathered in the hollow. If she
had only a light! She saw one of the
lanterns glimmering far off in the field,
but even if she obtained it she might not
be able to find the place again. She ad-
vanced into the hollow, bending down
low and searching the thick weeds and
tangled bushes with her eyes. One of
the buckets she had left behind; the
other yet contained a gourdful of water,
and she preserved it as if it were so
much gold, now more jealously than ever.
	She saw nothing. The place was larger
than she had thought, and was thick with
vines and weeds and heaped-up stones.
She stumbled twice and fell upoa her
knees, but each time she held the water
so well that not a drop was spilled. She
stood erect again, listening, but hearing
nothing. She called aloud, saying that
help was there, but no answer came.
Her heart was beating violently, but she
neither wept nor cried aloud, for she was
a woman of strength, and had always
been of few words and less show.
	Where she stood was the lowest point
of the battlefield, and was on its outer
edge. It was likewise the darkest spot,
and the remainder of it seemed to curve
before and above her in a great dusky
amphitheatre, broken faintly by a few
points of light where the lanterns burned.
She saw the formless bulk of a single
cart moving slowly. In a little while
the field would be abandoned to her and
the dead.
	She turned and continued the search,
feeling her way through the mass of ve-
getation, and listening for the guiding
groan. Again she stopped, and her heart
was in the grip of fear lest she should
not find him. She bent her ear close to
the ground, and then she heard a cry so
faint that it was but a sigh. She pushed
her way through some bushes, and there
he lay, his back against a rock, his white
girlish face with its circle of fair hair
turned up to the sky. The eyes were
closed, and the chest seemed not to move.
A great clot of blood hung upon his left
shoulder and made a red gleam against
the cloth of his coat.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00556" SEQ="0556" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="550">550	At the Twelfth Hour: A Tale of a Battle.

	Let it be said again that she was not
a woman who showed her emotions,
though at that first glance her face per-
haps turned as white as his. She set
the bucket down, knelt at his side, and,
putting her face close to his, found that
he was not dead, for she felt his breath
upon her lips. She raised the head a
little, and a sigh of pain, scarcely to be
heard, escaped him. She poured some
of the water, every drop more precious
now than ever, into the gourd, and moist-
ened his lips, which burned with the
fever. Then she raised his head higher
and dropped a little into his mouth. He
sighed again, and his eyelids quivered
and were lifted until a faint trace of the
blue beneath appeared; then they closed.
But she poured water into his mouth and
down his throat a second time, and she
could feel that pulse and breathing were
stronger.
	The blood was clotted and caked over
his wound, but with wisdom she let it
alone, knowing that there was no better
bandage to stop the flow. She wet his
hands and his face with water and gave
him more to drink, and saw a trace of
color appear in his cheeks. His eyes
opened partly two or three times, and
he talked, but not of anything she knew,
speaking in confused words of other bat-
tlefields and long marches; and before
a sentence or its sense was finished an-
other would be begun. She wanted no
help; she looked around in jealousy lest
another should come, and saw how small
was the chance of it. The last cart. had
disappeared from the field, so far as she
could see; she could count but four lights,
and they were far off. In that part of
the field, she, the living, was alone with
the dead and the boy who hung between
life and death.
	Never had she felt herself more strong
of body and mind, more full of re-
source ; never had she felt herself more
ready of head and hand. She gave him
the last of the water, and saw the spot
of color in his cheek, which was not of
fever, grow. Then she lifted him in her
arms, and began to walk with her bur-
den across the battlefield. She looked
at the wound, and seeing no fresh blood
knew that she had not strained it open
in lifting. With that she was satisfied,
and she went on with careful step.
	She felt her way through the rough-
ness of the hollow, where the bushes and
the weeds clung to her dress and her feet
and tried to trip her; but she thrust them
all aside and went on toward the house.
She passed out of the hollow, and into
the space which had received the full
sweep of the cannon-balls and bullets.
	The field was clothed in vapors which
floated around her like little clouds. The
white faces of the dead looked up at her,
and she seemed to be going between rows
of them on either side.
	She walked on with sure and steady
step, not feeling the weight in her arms
and against her shoulder, unmoved by
the ghastly heaps and the dead faces.
She reached the burnt ground, where the
little patches of fire that she had seen as
she passed the other way had ceased to
burn, but the smoke was still rising and
the ground was yet warm. She feared
that the smoke would get into his throat
and choke down the little life that was
left. So she ran, and the burnt arms of
the trees seemed to wave at her and to
jeer her, as if they knew she would be
too late. She stumbled a little, but re-
covered herself. The boy stirred and
groaned. She was in dread lest the rough
jolt had started his wound, but her hand
could not feel the warmth of fresh blood,
and, reassured, she hastened through the
burnt strip and toward home.
	The house was silent and dark; ap-
parently, no one had noticed the log cab-
in, its secluded position and the clump
of woods perhaps hiding it from men
whose attention had been devoted solely
to the battle. She pushed open the door,
and entered with her helpless burden.
Some coals still glowed on the hearth,
and threw out a warm light which bade</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00557" SEQ="0557" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="551">At the Twelfth Hour: A Tale of a Battle.	551

her welcome. She put the boy on the
bed, and covered the coals with ashes, for
it was hot and close in the house. Then
she lighted the piece of candle, and set-
ting it where it could serve her with its
light, and yet not shine into his eyes, she
proceeded with her work.
	Women who live such lives as hers
mu~t learn a little of all things, and she
knew the duties of a surgeon. Twice
she had bound up the wounds of her hus-
band, received in some mountain fray.
She undressed the young soldier, and as
she did so she noticed the scar of a
year-old wound under the shoulder,  a
wound that might well have been mortal.
The bullet of to-night had gone almost
through, and she could feel it against
the skin on the other side. She cut it
out easily with the blade of a pocket-
knife, and put it in the cupboard. Then
she bound up the wound the late bullet
had made when it entered, leaving the
congealed blood upon it as help against
a fresh flow, and sat down to wait.
	He was still talking, saying words that
had no meaning, and threw his arms
about a little; but he was stronger, and
she hoped, though she knew, too, that he
trembled on the edge.
	She sat for a long time watching every
movement, even the slightest. The little
clock ticked so loudly that she thought
once of stopping it; but the sound was
so steady and regular that it lulled them,
the boy as well as herself, and she let it
alone.
	He became quieter and grew stronger,
too, as she could tell by his breathing,
and slept. She spread a sheet over him,
and opened the window that a little air
might enter the close, warm room. She
stood there for a while and looked toward
the battlefield, but she could see nothing
now to tell her of the combat. The va-
pors that floated over it hid it and all its
ruin.
	The wind rose, stirring the hot, close air
and cooling the night. It whistled softly
through the trees and among the hills,
but it did not bring the smell of battle.
That had vanished with the combat that
had been so unreal itself, as she looked
at it from her window. Now she could
not see a human figure nor any sign of
war. The cabin was just the same lone
cabin among the hills that it had always
been. She went outside and made the
circuit of the house, but there was no-
thing for eye or ear to note. The night
was darkening again, the wind had blown
up clouds which hid the face of the moon,
and but a few stars twinkled in the sky.
The air felt damp, and scattered drops
of rain whirled before the wind which
was whistling, far off, as it drove away
through the hills.
	She went back into the house,  for
she could not leave the boy more than a
minute or two,  and found that he was
sleeping well. She prepared some stim-
ulants, and put them where they would
be ready to her hand. Then she made
over all her arrangements for the mor-
row, for two instead of one, and placed
everything about the house in order, that
it might put on its best look in the day.
light. She finished her task, and sat
down by the bed. Presently the sufferer
began to talk of battle and strive to
move, thinking he was in action on the
field again. When she felt of his wrist
and forehead, she saw that the fever was
rising, and she thought he was going to
die. She did all that her experience told
her, and waited. Her bitterness came
back, and she called them fools and bar-
barians once more; she was a fool her-
self to have had pity upon them.
	The boys wild talk was all of war.
She followed him through march and
camp, skirmish and battle, charge and
retreat, and saw how they had taken
their hold npon him, and what courage
and energy he had put into his part. In
half an hour he became quieter, and
the fever sank. A cannon-shot boomed
among the hills,  so far away that
the sound was softened by the distance.
But it echoed long; hill and valley took</PB>

it up and passed it on to farther hill
and valley; and she heard it again and
again, until it died away in the far-
thest hills like the last throb of a dis-
tant drumbeat. It was as if it had been
a minute gun for the dead, and she went
in terror to the bed; but the boy was
not dead. He had passed again from de-
lirium to sleep, and, fearing everything
now, she went outside to see if the cannon-
shot, by any chance, foretold a renewal
of the battle; but it must have been a
stray shot, for, as before, nowhere could
she see a light, nowhere a living figure,
nor could she hear any sound of human
beings. The air was cooler, and, shiver-
ing, she went back into the house.
	Presently the drops changed to steady
rain, which beat upon the windows; but
it was peaceful and sheltered in the little
house, and as she looked out at the rain,
dashed past by the wind, there was a soft-
ness in her heart. The rain ceased after a
while, and the trees and bushes dripped
silver drops. The boy stirred; but it was
some thought in his sleep that made him
stir, not fever. She looked at him close
ly.	His breathing was regular and easy,
and she knew that he would live.
	Going once more to the window, and
with eyes to the skies, she gave her word-
less thanks to God.
	A broad bar of light appeared in the
east. The day was coming.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR FOREIGN POLICY.

	B~ the results of the war with Spain
we are brought face to face with the be-
ginning of a new epoch not only of our
national development, but possibly of the
worlds progress; and, as in former great
epochs of the worlds progress the chief
actors have found themselves borne on-
ward by an irresistible force far beyond
their original intent, so does it seem that
we are irresistibly borne onward to duties
and responsibilities new to us and mo-
mentous in character, by the course of
events during the past six months. It is
unquestionable that our original inten-
tion was as honest as were the original
intentions of Washington and Lincoln at
the beginning of their great life-work;
yet the result of their life-work in each
case was the reverse of their original pnr-
pose, without any intentional breach of
their good faith. Of such may truly be
repeated the profound remark of Crom-
well, One never goes so far as when he
planneth not.
	Whatever may be the theories of
moralists, the worlds life and progress
proceed npon facts. That the colonial
empire of Spain is overthrown by this
war is a fact as absolute as that the
Rome of the C~esars has fallen. It is
also a fact that, whatever may have been
our original intent last April, we are the
successors of Spain in the West Indies
and, to an undefined extent, in the Pa-
cific. We cannot escape the conse-
quences of that fact, nor the duties and

it up and passed it on to farther hill
and valley; and she heard it again and
again, until it died away in the far-
thest hills like the last throb of a dis-
tant drumbeat. It was as if it had been
a minute gun for the dead, and she went
in terror to the bed; but the boy was
not dead. He had passed again from de-
lirium to sleep, and, fearing everything
now, she went outside to see if the cannon-
shot, by any chance, foretold a renewal
of the battle; but it must have been a
stray shot, for, as before, nowhere could
she see a light, nowhere a living figure,
nor could she hear any sound of human
beings. The air was cooler, and, shiver-
ing, she went back into the house.
	Presently the drops changed to steady
rain, which beat upon the windows; but
it was peaceful and sheltered in the little
house, and as she looked out at the rain,
dashed past by the wind, there was a soft-
ness in her heart. The rain ceased after a
while, and the trees and bushes dripped
silver drops. The boy stirred; but it was
some thought in his sleep that made him
stir, not fever. She looked at him close
ly.	His breathing was regular and easy,
and she knew that he would live.
	Going once more to the window, and
with eyes to the skies, she gave her word-
less thanks to God.
	A broad bar of light appeared in the
east. The day was coming.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR FOREIGN POLICY.

	B~ the results of the war with Spain
we are brought face to face with the be-
ginning of a new epoch not only of our
national development, but possibly of the
worlds progress; and, as in former great
epochs of the worlds progress the chief
actors have found themselves borne on-
ward by an irresistible force far beyond
their original intent, so does it seem that
we are irresistibly borne onward to duties
and responsibilities new to us and mo-
mentous in character, by the course of
events during the past six months. It is
unquestionable that our original inten-
tion was as honest as were the original
intentions of Washington and Lincoln at
the beginning of their great life-work;
yet the result of their life-work in each
case was the reverse of their original pnr-
pose, without any intentional breach of
their good faith. Of such may truly be
repeated the profound remark of Crom-
well, One never goes so far as when he
planneth not.
	Whatever may be the theories of
moralists, the worlds life and progress
proceed npon facts. That the colonial
empire of Spain is overthrown by this
war is a fact as absolute as that the
Rome of the C~esars has fallen. It is
also a fact that, whatever may have been
our original intent last April, we are the
successors of Spain in the West Indies
and, to an undefined extent, in the Pa-
cific. We cannot escape the conse-
quences of that fact, nor the duties and
responsibilities that follow from it.
	If we destroy the military forces of the
rulers of a province, we not only break
the enemys prestige and power, but we
must assume the responsibility of the ex-
pelled government for the preservation
of peace and order. As a corollary, it
follows that if we should merely content
ourselves with taking a coaling station,
and should not provide for the orderly
government of the conquered district,
we should become accountable for the
anarchy that would ensue. On the other
hand, if, after taking a coaling station
as a prize of war, we should sell or other-
wise divide the rest of a conquered de</PB>

pendency, should we not be acting the
part of a robber nation, dividing the
spoils of war with other nations for our
own profit, and to silence their demands
and obtain their acquiescence?
	However bad may have been the Span-
ish colonial government, it was a govern-
ment; it did give a certain degree of
peace and order both in the Philippines
and in the West Indies; it was better
than anarchy, probably better than any
semi-barbaric government which it is in
the power of the Philippine insurgents
to establish without our protection and
supervision for a period, at least; and in
Cuba, perhaps better than the Cuban in-
surgents can establish at the present time
without our friendly assistance. It there-
fore seems our duty, however undesired,
to continue for the present in control of
whatever territory may be taken from
Spain as the fruit of our victories, and
to administer the government for the
benefit of the inhabitants until we are
satisfied of their willingness and ability
to maintain in a reasonable degree peace
and order, law and justice. We, as trus-
tees and guardians of several millions of
people of different races from our own,
have become the political arbiters of their
destiny, and are bound to provide against
civil war among them.
	Our responsibility for the administra-
tion of this trust cannot be transferred
by accepting the professions of native in-
surgent leaders and their production of
paper constitutions and forms of govern-
ment. We cannot terminate our trust,
even though unsought and onerous, until
the conquered dependency is under a
government which does give it a reason-
able degree of peace, law, and equity,
and whose permanence may be assumed
from the general confidence and support
of the inhabitants. Inde~d, war assumes
a promise to abide by its consequences,
for better and for worse; to accept the
responsibilities of victory as well as its
glory, with the same manly courage with
which we face wounds and death in bat-
tle, sickness and pestilence in hospital,
and the public cost and private sorrow
at home which may result from it. Let
us not hesitate to perform our duty like
men, and, like prudent men, let us exam-
ine our position so as to measure the dif-
ficulties of our task.

	The long-established foreign policy
of the United States was originally for-
mulated in Washingtons Farewell Ad-
dress, and was more fully defined in the
Monroe Doctrine message and in subse-
quent expositions of its application by
successive secretaries of state.
	In all these state papers the principles
and doctrines were set forth as the dc-
clarations of a sovereign nation. As
in all declarations of intent, the nation
necessarily reserved the right to change
or modify these principles and doctrines
when eases should arise for their practi-
cal application in the promotion of great
permanent interests of the nation. For,
be it distinctly understood, such declara-
tions are unilateral, and without cove-
nant, direct or implied, to bind our hands
to act against what may seem our public
interests. To deny this principle of na-
tional life would be to hang about the
nations neck, like a constantly increasing
weight, the accumulating errors of suc-
cessive generations, and thus ultimately
to destroy the nation,  a doctrine di-
rectly opposed to the paramount duty of
self-preservation. Indeed, a declaration
of intent, announced as an act of courtesy
or warning to foreign nations, and not for
valuable consideration, establishes no pre-
scriptive rights, however long enjoyed,
but may be resumed or reversed at the
will of the nation without prejudice to
its good faith. Nor can such change of
policy be made a ground by other nations
for demanding an explanation; a na-
tions sovereignty and the exercise of its
sovereign rights are not open to the ad-
judication of other nations, its possible
rivals or enemies.
	Therefore, whatever may be the for-</PB>

eign policy which the United States may
adopt in the West Indies or in the Pa-
cific, no European power has a right to
demand an explanation of our intentions,
or even of particular acts, unless they
threaten immediate hostilities. Much less
can the right be claimed that such policy
nullifies our general foreign policy or our
local foreign policy in a distant part of
the world. Such a claim could be looked
upon only as an intolerable insolence on
the part of the government making it,
and should be sternly rejected.
	But assuming that the results of this
war require the adoption by the United
States of a colonial policy in the West
Indies and the Philippines, it has been
held  doubtless with perfect sincerity
by many  that we should thereby defi-
nitely abandon our traditional foreign
policy as defined in Washingtons Fare-
well Address, the Monroe Doctrine mes-
sage, and official expositions of the same
by our state department; and fear has
been expressed that we should give a pro-
vocation for European intervention in
American affairs, to say nothing of the
ruinous consequences to our republic in-
evitable to the control of colonies, as
shown by the corruption and failure of
Spain herself because of these very colo-
nies. To see whether there be such grave
danger, let us briefly review the first ap-
plications of the Farewell Address and
the Monroe Doctrine, and determine to
what extent they truly apply to the con-
ditions that now face us.
	The doctrine of the balance of power
in Europe furnishes the key to European
political history for the past three cen-
turies. It had been intended that the
status quo established by the Peace of
Westphalia (1648), when western Eu-
rope was politically redistributed among
the several rulers, should be permanent.
It was held to be an outrage against the
peace of Europe to attempt a material
change of the territorial distribution then
established; to avert this, standing ar-
mies were maintained and endless di-
plomatic negotiations kept up, requiring
permanent legations at all important cap-
itals.
	Richelieu is credited with devising
this scheme for the purpose of assuring
the superiority in Europe of France and
the house of Bourbon over the Haps-
burg dynasties in Austria and Germany
and in Spain; his central idea was to
keep Germany from unification, and to
this end to reorganize the German Em-
pire into groups of independent states
according to their religion, preserving a
nominal allegiance to elective emperors
and state-rights to the princes, not only
in local affairs, but in foreign relations.
As thus organized there were two hun-
dred and three sovereiguties, separated
by religious differences and by local
jealousies and interests,  an ideal ar-
rangement for foreign intrigues and com-
binations, controversies and wars, as the
normal political condition of Europe for
centuries to come. Thus Richelieu won
the name Father of European Diplo-
macy. So effective was this arrange-
ment that Germany was kept weak and
divided until the Sadowa campaign ob-
literated Austria from German politics
in 1866, and the Franco - German war
resulted in the complete unification of
Germany under the Hoheuzollerns.
	Now the keystone of the doctrine of
the balance of power was perpetuation
of the political distribution of power in
Europe established by the Peace of West-
phalia,  political stagnation fatalto na-
tional development. The constant wars
of the seventeenth and eighteenth cen-
turies were manifestations of the impos-
sibility that the world should stand still;
the readjustments, at the close of such
wars, were all based on throwing in
makeweights to restore the balance
of power in Europe; for all Europe had
come to look upon the rest of the world
 her colonial dependencies in America,
Asia, and Africa  as created solely for
her benefit. This balance of power in
Europe, up to the close of the eighteenth</PB>

century, was the struggle between France
and Austria for supremacy in Europe, 
a dynastic question with which America
had no direct intrinsic concern. Wash-
ingtons Farewell Address happily de-
scribes it as broils of European ambi-
tion, rivalship, interest, humor, or ca-
price.
	Our revolutionary statesmen personal-
ly understood how fatal to peace in Amer-
ica would be the continued extension of
this European doctrine of balance of pow-
er to America,  to the United States
as an ally, to the European colonies in
America if they were to continue to be
used as makeweights. Washingtons own
military career opened in the Virginia
forests because England and Prussia had
become involved in war with France and
Austria over dynastic questions growing
out of this European balance of power;
they knew how Louisburg had been be-
sieged and taken by New England troops
in 1745, and by the treaty of peace in
1748 had been given back to France in
exchange for the French trading factory
at Madras.
	Indeed, these American dependencies
of Europe were sold and exchanged like
West India negroes: some of the West
India islands had changed owners ten
times in less than two centuries; the
Dutch province of New York was ob-
tained by the Eng]ish in exchange for
the English colony of Surinam in Guiana.
After being held by Holland, England,
and Spain in turn, the island of Santa
Cruz was sold successively to the Knights
of Malta, the French West India Com-
pany, the king of France, and the gov-
ernment of Denmark (by which it was
recently offered for sale to the United
States). In like manner, after similar
transfers, the island of St. Bartholomew
was given to the king of Sweden by
France in exchange for the right of
French merchants to trade at the Swe-
dish port of Gottenburg.
	All these facts were notorious, and
were acutely realized by our revolution-
ary statesmen. Hamilton used them as
arguments in favor of the adoption of
the Constitution: we should thus concur
in creating a great American system, su-
perior to all transatlantic force and in-
fluence, and able to dictate the terms of
connection between the Old World and
the New World. 1 John Adams noted
in his Diary this remark of his to the
British plenipotentiary in negotiating our
treaty of peace with Great Britain in
1783: It is obvious that all the pow-
ers of Europe will be continually ma-
neuvring to work us into their real or
imaginary balances of power; they will
all seek to make of us a makeweight can-
dle in weighing out their pounds.
	That this makeweight system would
be a menace to our peace as a nation
was fully understood; for what security
should we have if European powers,
owning West India islands commanding
our coast and commerce, could sell them
to our rivals or enemies?
	Thus we see that the two deside~ata
set forth in Washingtons Farewell Ad-
dress were  no political entanglements
of the United States in European political
broils, and an American system apart
and separate from that of Europe. These
points were finally embodied in Monroes
famous message of December 2, 1823.
	The scheme of the balance of power
had its own development, and was fol-
lowed by other plans to secure similar
ends. The Napoleonic wars made a
new readjustment of European bounda-
ries necessary, but first of all Europe
must overthrow the military domination
of Napoleon. Hence the Holy Alliance
of the five great Powers, arranged by
Lord Castlereagh in the Treaty of Chau-
mont, March 1, 1814. Lord Castle-
reaghs circular of June 19, 1821, offi-
cially states its purpose: It was a union
for the reconquest and liberation of a
great portion of the continent of Europe
from the military despotism of France;
and, having subdued the conqueror, it

took the state of possession, as established
by the peace, under its protection. It
never was, however, intended for the
government of the world or for the su-
perintendence of the internal affairs of
other states. This is a most important
exposition for us to bear in mind, be-
cause it led to the announcement of our
Monroe Doctrine.
	The formation of the Holy Alliance
was essentially the overthrow of the doc-
trine of political equality of sovereign
states, which had been an important fac-
tor in the scheme of balance of power.
It set up the primacy of the great Pow-
ers as trustees for settling European ques-
tions; it made the settlement of questions
of European interest depend upon the
common consent of the great Powers;
hence the later name concert of Eu-
rope.
	The Holy Alliance, after reorganizing
Europe, undertook to re~stablish Spain
in her revolted American colonies. At
this England protested, and withdrew
from the Alliance. Isolated, she decided
to invite the United States to join her
in formal protest against the proposed
interference of the Holy Alliance in Span-
ish America. Mr. Canning suggested this
joint action to United States minister
Rush, who submitted the correspondence
to President Monroe, and the latter sent
the papers to ex-Presidents Jefferson and
Madison, asking their views. The reply
of Jefferson, dated October 24, 1823,
shows how logically he deduced the
Monroe Doctrine from the principles of
Washingtons Farewell Address: The
question presented by the letters you
have sent me is the most momentous
which has been offered to my contempla-
tion since that of Independence. That
made us a nation; this sets the compass
and points the course which we are to
steer through the ocean of time opening
	1 The status of the Suez Canal, being an
Egyptian and therefore a Turkish question,
was recognized as of general European interest,
and, after much fruitless negotiation, the canal
to us. . . . Our first and fundamental
maxim should be never to entangle our-
selves in the broils of Europe; our sec-
ond, never to suffer Europe to inter-
meddle in cisatlantic affairs. America,
North and South, has a set of interests
distinct from those of Europe and pecu-
liarly her own; she should have a system
of her own, separate and apart from that
of Europe. . . . We will oppose with
all our means the forcible interposition
of any other power (in American colo-
nial questions) as auxiliary, stipendia-
ry, or under any other form or pretext;
and most especially their transfer to any
other power by conquest, cession, or ac-
quisition in any other way. This is
a concrete statement of the principles
of the Monroe Doctrine, if we add the
claim, already then announced, that as
all American territory belonged to some
Christian power, none of it was subject
to European colonization.
	Thus we have the Monroe Doctrine
for the protection of America, North
and South, from the European political
schemes of balance of power, primacy of
the great Powers, and European concert.
	Englands refusal to consent to the
restoration of the Spanish Bourbons in
Spanish America, largely because of her
opposition to the Spanish system of co-
lonial monopoly, led to the downfall of
the Holy Alliance. But the idea of com-
mon consent had become a fixed prin-
ciple of European politics and was ex-
tended to the Eastern Question, which
has been the disturbing question of Eu-
ropean politics for three quarters of a
century.
	It was because the concert of Europe
could not agree upon intervention in Tur-
key that the recent Armenian massacres
were allowed to go unpunished, although
all the great Powers individually ab-
horred the outrages.

was neutralized by the convention of 1888 be-
tween the six great Powers, to which Turkey,
Spain, and the Netherlands subsequently be-
came parties by accession. But let it be die-</PB>

	We see, then, that European political
questions are as distinct and apart from
American questions to-day as they have
been at any time during the past cen-
tury; and that an American system
has grown out of the Monroe Doctrine
through its acceptance as their own policy
also by many if not all the other Amer-
ican republics. We claim no right of in-
tervention in the domestic or foreign
concerns of any American state, except
so far as to prevent European intermed-
dling with its political destiny. We stood
as defender of the Mexican people against
the establishment of an empire under a
European intruder backed by a Euro-
pean army of invaders; we extended
our friendly offices in the settlement of
the Venezuela-Guiana boundary dispute,
which  after chronic controversies 
was finally referred to international ar-
bitration; on several occasions we have
consented to adjudicate boundary dis-
agreements between American nations at
their mutual request; and we engaged
in a costly general war to put an end to
an intolerable condition of barbarity in
~ European colony at our door, and as-
sure its people due security of life and
property, peace, law, and equity; nor
could we allow any European power to
redress these wrongs, any more than we
could permit a European power to trans-
fer its American dependencies to another
European power.
	It has been said by a very eminent
European writer on international law
that the position of the United States

tinctly noted that this neutralization was ac-
connted a European question, and that every
one of the signatory Powers (except Austria)
had colonies in Asia or Africa, to which this
canal was a necessary waterway,  the shortest
line of approach. On the other hand, the Eu-
ropean Powers which had no colonies to be
reached by the Suez Canal were not parties to
the convention. The German canal from Kiel
on the Baltic to the North Sea, the Caledonian
canal across Scotland, the canal across the
Isthmus of Corinth, and the projected French
canal from the Bay of Biscay to the Mediterra
on the American continent is in some
respects like, and in others exceedingly
unlike, that which is accorded in Europe
to the six great Powers. . . . If it be
true that there is a primacy in America
comparable to that which exists in Eu-
rope, it must be wielded by her, and by
her alone. 1
	It may be truly said that the United
States does exercise a primacy in Ameri-
ca, but it is confined to the protection of
American states against the land-hunger
of Europe. We have never intervened
in the internal dissensions of any Ameri-
can state, nor in controversies or wars
between American states; we have nev-
er pushed unsought our good offices or
mediation upon them in their difficulties,
nor have we objected to their choice
of European Powers as a~rbitrators. We
have strictly confined ourselves to the
part of a good friend to each of them,
whose friendly offices are always at their
command for the honorable settlement
of controversies among themselves or
with European Powers.
	If this be primacy in America, most
assuredly it is a kind of primacy radi-
cally different from that which has ar-
rayed armies of millions in Europe, and
established a European concert to  su-
perintend the solution of the Eastern
Question,  in other words, to regulate
the disintegration of Turkey, 2 without
producing a general war in the scramble
for desirable bits of the crumbling Turk-
ish Empire. Whatever may be the the-
ory of the concert of Europe, the fact

nean  all ship canals  are considered local,
and not of general European interest.
	For a similar reason, the construction of an
American Isthmus canal, whether at Nicaragua
or at Panama, cannot be claimed to he a Euro-
pean question, or in any way under the control
of the concert of Europe. On the contrary, it
is purely an American question, for the same
reason that the Suez Canal is purely a Euro-
pean question.

is that the Crimean war was made to
prevent Russia getting a larder share
of Turkey than seemed fair to the other
Powers; this same spirit of jealous rival-
ry, perhaps of self-defense, compelled
Russia to yield the fruits of victory ex-
torted from Turkey by the Peace of
S. Stefano two decades ago.
	The foreign policy of this country
has been to have no political connection
with foreign countries in the local Eu-
ropean schemes of European balance of
power, primacy in Europe, concert of
Europe, Triple Alliance, or whatever
other names may represent European
politics. But our policy is settled in re-
gard to the intervention of European
Powers in America for controlling the
political destiny of any American nation
or for the control by transfer of any
European dependency in America.
Hence the escape of the weaker nations
of Latin America from the toils of Eu-
ropean intervention and land-hunger.
	Whatever may be our policy, more-
over, in regard to purely American ques-
tions, as belon,,ing to a system separate
and apart from that of Europe, we are
perfectly free to adopt whatever foreign
policy we may deem proper in regard to
other than American questions; nor can
such policy be held in any way to mili.
tate against or nullify our American
policy.
	When we note the recent land scrab-
ble in Africa, and the partition of that
continent among the great Powers of
western Europe, in some way based on
the doctrine of equivalents, we behold
a disposition to extend the European sys-
tem of balance of power beyond Europe.
And in the Far East to-day we see, in
process of accomplishment, a partition
of China remarkably resembling the re-
cently accomplished partition of Africa.
Whether in Africa or in the Far East,
the fundamental cause is the same,  a
scramble for foreign markets, with po-
litical dominion thrown in to assure their
permanence.
	At this juncture the United States wins
a notable naval victory at Manila, which
presumably puts us in practical control
at least of a part of a tropical archi-
pelago about as large as Japan, inhabited
by some ten million people. We know
that the Philippines, despite Spanish mis-
government and corruption, have an
average foreign trade of fifty million
dollars a year,  as great as Japans
twenty years ago, and one fifth that of
China to-day. Though our knowledge of
the natural resources of the Philippines
is still vague, the general opinion is that
in natural resources they will compare
favorably with any part of the Far East.
And we may believe that, under honest
government, peace and order will reign,
and within a score of years, under the
protection of the United States, they may
become a commercial rival of Japan.
	The opening of this group of islands as
a foreign market of increasing purchas-
ing power, as a goal for our commerce
and navigation~ on the Pacific, comes
when a large and increasing foreign mar-
ket seems to this country, as it has seemed
to European Powers, an absolute neces-
sity not only for industrial prosperity,
but for mitigating the conflict between
labor and capital.
	With China already partly partitioned
between Russia, Germany, and France,
after their colonial system in the anti-
quated interest of colonial monopoly;
with Great Britain and Japan also. shar-
ers of China, but on the principle of the
open door,  that is, all nations to
trade on equal terms,  we are brought
face to face with two radically different
policies for colonial dependencies. To
the people not only of the Philippines,
but of China, the question involved by
these two divergent policies is momen-
tous, involving the destiny of quite a fifth
of the worlds inhabitants. That ques-
tion is whether they shall be the slaves
of commercial monopoly under Russian,
German, and French task - masters, or
whether they shall be open to modern life</PB>

and thought on the open door system
of Anglo-Saxon civilization.
	We can well understand how the par-
tition of China has been arranged on the
doctrine of equivalents, and how an equi-
librium has thus been created. But, as-
suming that Spain permanently loses the
Philippines, who is to take control? It
is evident that the apparent equilibrium
between England, France, Germany,
Russia, and Japan would be entirely de-
stroyed by adding the Philippines to the
holdings of either of those five Powers,
and this would bring grave controversy,
if not war, against the recipient, from the
other four Powers. There seems but one
thing that can avert this terrible result,
namely, the advent of a new first-class
Power in the Far East, which is on terms
of perfect friendship with all five Powers.
	Whether we like it or not, of all the
nations of the world to-day, the United
States is the only Power which can take
these islands and develop them without
disturbing the politico-commercial equi-
librium in the Far East.
	When we look back upon the bureau-
cratic methods adopted by the continen-
tal Powers in colonization, and see how
little of genuine civilization has accrued
to their colonies; when we compare this
meagre exhibit with the steady and no-
ble progress of every Anglo-Saxon state,
territory, colony and dependency 
whether Caucasian or of lower race 
in all that makes man happy, prosperous,
and progressive, the victory at Manila
does seem as an awakening of the Phil-
ippines, and such an awakening as may
hasten the spread throughout eastern
Asia of the blessings of modern civiliza-
tion.
	What is the grand central Anglo-Saxon
idea in the founding of states? It is first
of all, and above all, that government is
organized, according to the condition of
the people to be governed, for a single
practical purpose, and that purpose is to
establish peace, law, and equity; so that,
under it, all men shall be equal before
the law and shall have equal justice;
that all men shall be at peace with one
another under the law, and shall enjoy
equal protection in accumulating and
using their property; that there shall be
no military overlord or military caste to
tyrannize over the plain men of the peo-
ple; that there shall be no religious over-
lord or religious caste to tyrannize over
their souls; that the poor and unfortu-
nate shall not become outcasts, and their
children after them; that public educa-
tion shall be freely dispensed as a means
of uplifting mens souls and lives and
making them good citizens,  self-re-
specting and intellig~nt, and able to take
a constantly increasing part in the affairs
of government.
	The Anglo-Saxon of to-day is the pro-
duct of a thousand years of continuous
effort to make brave and honest men.
For centuries we have practiced the art of
self-government, until to govern has be-
come an instinct, and to be self-governed
a habit. To us power means opportu-
nity to help others; it also means re-
sponsibility, not to man only, but to God,
for the wise use of the power thus given
us. And for this reason we are especial-
ly fitted to act as trustees and guardians
of inferior races, and peculiarly qualified
to fit them eventually to govern them-
selves. That this is very truth, compare
India and Egypt to-day with what they
were before the advent of their Anglo-
Saxon rulers.

		BISMARCK AS A NATIONAL TYPE.

	IT was a spring day in 1883. The
crafts and trades of Berlin were cele-
brating the anniversary of the founding
of one of their guilds some four or five
centuries ago. In good German fash-
ion, there was an abundance of solemn
and sonorous jollification throughout the
day, but the climax of the exercises was
reached in an historical pageant repre-
senting the growth of Berlin commerce
and manufactures from the Middle Ages
down to the present time.
	It had been given out that this pageant
was to be reviewed by the old Emperor
from his familiar corner window; it was
rumored that it would also pass by the
imperial Chancellery, and that Prince
Bismarck would probably be there to see
it pass. In anticipation of this event, a
dense multitude had taken possession of
the square in front of Bismarcks official
residence  the Wilhelmsplatz  hours
before the procession had even begun to
move. An eager, nervous expectation
seemed to hover over the surging masses.
Will the procession really come this way?
If it does, will he appear,  he who is so
indifferent to pompous demonstrations,
so averse to appeals to the crowd? As
yet there was no sign of life in the
Bismarck mansion: the windows were
closed; most of the curtains were drawn.
Perhaps the prince is not even at home,
or is too engrossed in public business to
have given any attention to this local hol-
iday. In spite of such misgivings, the
populace held out unfalteringly; every
minute swelled its numbers. Now, not
only the square, but the adjoining streets
also were literally packed. Presently
there was heard from the direction of
Unter den Linden the low thunder of tu-
multuous cheering, interspersed now and
then with some distant strains of martial
music; evidently the procession was pass-
ing the Emperors palace. Nearer and
nearer the sounds came, and higher and
higher ran our feverish excitement.
	Presently in a wing of the Chancellery
nearest to the Wilhelmstrasse a window
was thrown open: the Princess Bismarck
and Count Herbert leaned out, and far
back in the darkness of the room there,
loomed up a shadowy form, from which
a mighty head seemed to be shining forth
with something like electric energy. To
attempt to describe the frenzy which
seized the thousands in the street at this
sight would be a futile task. It was as
though we had had a vision, as though
something superhuman had suddenly
flashed down upon us and extinguished
every other feeling except the impulse to
worship. How long we had been cheer-
ing before he came forward to the win-
dow I cannot tell, but I venture to say
that even an American football enthusi-
ast would have been pleased with our
efforts.

the Chancellery in seemingly endless ar-
ray, every band striking up The Watch

		BISMARCK AS A NATIONAL TYPE.

	IT was a spring day in 1883. The
crafts and trades of Berlin were cele-
brating the anniversary of the founding
of one of their guilds some four or five
centuries ago. In good German fash-
ion, there was an abundance of solemn

day, but the climax of the exercises was
reached in an historical pageant repre-

	It had been given out that this pageant
was to be reviewed by the old Emperor

maker and unmaker of kings and em-
perors, the founder of German unity,
the arbiter of Europe ? Undoubtedly
this was a large part of it. But politi-
cal achievements alone are not sufficient
to stir the peoples heart. What called
forth this extraordinary outburst of en-
thusiasm, what gave to every one in that
crowd the sense of heightened existence,
was, after all, the man, not his work; it
was the instinctive feeling that in this
one man yonder there were contained
the lives of many millions of Germans,
their dreams and struggles, their eccen-
tricities and yearnings, their mistakes
and triumphs, their prejudices, passions,
ideals, their love, hate, humor, poetry,
religion.
	Let us single out a few of these affin-
ities between Bismarck and the German
people, in order to understand, however
imperfectly, why the news of his death
that has burst so suddenly upon us means
for the sons of the Fatherland, all over
the globe, the severing of their own lives
from what they feel to have been the most
complete embodiment of German nation-
ality since Luther.

I.

	Perhaps the most obviously Teutonic
trait in Bismarcks character is its mar-
tial quality. It would be preposterous,
of course, to claim warlike distinction as
a prerogative of the German race. Rus-
sians, Frenchmen, Englishmen, Ameri-
cans, undoubtedly, make as good fighters
as Germans. But it is not an exagger-
ation to say that there is no other coun-
try in the world where the army is as
enlightened or as popular an institution
as it is in Germany. I do not underrate
the evils of militarism. I believe the
struggle against these evils will be the
foremost task of the next twenty - five
years in German political life. Yet I
fail to see how it can be denied that the
introduction of universal military service,
whichwe owe to the inner regeneration
of Prussia after the downfall of 1806, has
	VOL. LXXXII.  NO. 492.	36
been the very corner - stone of German
greatness in this century.
	The German army is not composed of
hirelings, of professional fighters whose
business it is to pick up quarrels, no mat-
ter with whom. It is, in the strictest sense
of the word, the people in arms. Among
its officers there is a large percentage of
the intellectual ~lite of the country; its
rank and file embrace every occupation
and every class of society, from the
scion of royal blood down to the son of
the seamstress. Although it is based
upon the unconditional acceptance of
the monarchical creed, nothing is farther
removed from it than the spirit of ser-
vility. On the contrary, one of the very
first teachings inculcated upon the Ger-
man recruit is that in wearing the kings
coat he is performing a public duty,
and that by performing this duty he is
honoring himself. Nor can it be said
that it is the aim of German military
drill to reduce the soldier to a mere ma-
chine, at will to be set in motion or be
brought to a standstill by his superior.
The aim of this drill is rather to give
each soldier increased self-control, men-
tally no less than bodily; to develop his
self-respect; to enlarge his sense of re-
sponsibility, as well as to teach him the
absolute necessity of the subordination
of the individual to the needs of the
whole. The German army, then, is by
no means a lifeless tool that might be
used by an unscrupulous and adventurous
despot to gratify his own whims or to
wreak his private vengeance. The Ger-
man army is, in principle at least, a na-
tional school of manly virtues, of disci-
pline, of comradeship, of self-sacrifice, of
promptness of action, of tenacity of pur-
pose. Although the most powerful ar-
mament which the world has ever seen,
it makes for peace rather than for war.
Although called upon to defend the stan-
dard of the most imperious dynasty of
western Europe, it contains more of the
spirit of true democracy than many a city
government on this side of the Atlantic.</PB>

	All this has to be borne in mind, if
we wish to judge correctly of Bismarcks
military propensities. He has never
concealed the fact that he felt himself
above all a soldier. One of his earliest
public utterances was a defense of the
Prussian army against the sympathizers
with the Revolution of 1848. His first
great political achievement was the car-
rying through of King Williams army
reform in the face of the most stubborn
and virulent opposition of a parliament-
ary majority. Never did his speech in
the German Diet rise to a higher pathos
than when he was asserting the mili-
tary supremacy of the Emperor, or call-
ing upon the parties to forget their dis-
sensions in maintaining the defensive
strength of the nation, or showering con-
tempt upon Liberal deputies who seemed
to think that questions of national ex-
istence could be solved by effusions of
academic oratory. Over and over, dur-
ing the last decade of his official career,
did he declare that the only thing which
kept him from throwing aside the worry
and vexation of governmental duties, and
retiring to the much coveted leisure of
home and hearth, was the oath of vassal
loyalty constraining him to stand at his
post until his imperial master released
him of his own accord. At the very
height of his political triumphs he wrote
to his sovereign: I have always regret-
ted that my parents did not allow me to
testify my attachment to the royal house,
and my enthusiasm for the greatness and
glory of the Fatherland, in the front rank
of a regiment rather than behind a writ-
ing-desk. And even now, after having
been raised by your Majesty to the high-
est honors of a statesman, I cannot al-
together repress a feeling of regret at
not having been similarly able to carve
out a career for myself as a soldier. Per-
haps I should have made a poor general,
but if I had been free to follow the bent
of my own inclination I would rather
have won battles for your Majesty than
diplomatic campaigns.
	It seems clear to me that both the de-
fects and the greatness of Bismarcks
character are intimately associated with
these military leanings of his. He cer-
tainly was overbearing; he could toler-
ate no opposition; he was revengeful and
unforgiving; lie took pleasure in the ap-
peal to violence; he easily resorted to
measures of repression; he requited in-
sults with counter-insults; he had some-
thing of that blind furor Teutonious
which was the terror of the Italian re-
publics in the Middle Ages. These are
defects of temper which will probably
prevent his name from ever shining with
that serene lustre of international ven-
eration that has surrounded the memory
of a Joseph II. or a Washington with
a kind of impersonal immaculateness.
But his countrymen, at least, have every
reason to condone these defects; for they
are concomitant results of the military
bent of German character, and they are
offset by such transcendent military vir-
tues that we would almost welcome them
as bringing this colossal figure within
the reach of our own frailties and short-
comings.
	Three of the military qualities that
made Bismarek great seem to me to
stand out with particular distinctness:
his readiness to take the most tremen-
dous responsibilities, if he could justify
his action by the worth of the cause for
which he made himself responsible; his
moderation after success was assured;
his unflinching submission to the dictates
of monarchical discipline.
	Moritz Busch has recorded an occur-
rence, belonging to the autumn of 1877,
which most impressively brings before
us the tragic grandeur and the porten-
tous issues of Bismareks career. It was
twilight at Varzin, and the Chancellor,
as was his wont after dinner, was sitting
by the stove in the large back drawing-
room. After having sat silent for a
while, gazing straight before him, and
feeding the fire now and anon with fir
cones, he suddenly began to complain</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00569" SEQ="0569" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="563">	Btsmarck as a National Type.	563

that his political activity had brought
him but little satisfaction and few
friends. Nobody loved him for what
he had done. He had never made any-
body happy thereby, he said,  not him-
self, nor his family, nor any one else.
Some of those present would not admit
this, and suggested that he had made
a great nation happy. But, he con-
tinued, how many have I made unhap-
py! But for me three great wars would
not have been fought; eighty thousand
men would not have perished; parents,
brothers, sisters, and wives would not
have been bereaved and plunged into
mourning. . . . That matter, however,
I have settled with God. Settled
with God!  an amazing statement, a
statement which would seem the height
of blasphemy, if it were not an expres-
sion of noblest manliness; if it did not
reveal the soul of a warrior dauntlessly
fighting for a great cause, risking for it
the existence of a whole country as well
as his own happiness, peace, and salva-
tion, and being ready to submit the con-
sequences, whatever they might be, to the
tribunal of eternity. To say that a man
who is willing to take such responsibili-
ties as these makes himself thereby an
offender against morality appears to me
tantamount to condemning the Alps as
obstructions to bicycling. At any rate,
a people that glories in the achievements
of Luther has no right to cast a slur upon
the motives of Bismarck.
	Whatever one may think ofthe worth
of the cause for which Bismarck battled
all his life,  the unity and greatness of
Germany,  it is impossible not to ad-
mire the policy of moderation and self-re-
straint pursued by him after every one of
his most decisive victories. Here again
we note in him the peculiarly German
military temper. German war-songs do
not glorify foreign conquest and brilliant
adventure; they glorify dogged resist-
ance, and bitter fight for house and home,
for kith and kin. The German army,
composed as it is of millions of peaceful
citizens, is essentially a weapon of de-
fense. And it can truly be said that Bis-
marck, with all his natural aggressiveness
and ferocity, was in the main a defender,
not a conqueror. He defended Prussia
against the intolerable arrogance and un-
German policy of Austria; he defended
Germany against French interference in
the work of national consolidation; he
defended the principle of state sovereign-
ty against the encroachments of the pa-
pacy; he defended the monarchy against
the republicanism of the Liberals and
Socialists; and his last public act was
a defense of ministerial responsibility
against the new - f angled absolutism of
his young imperial master.
	The third predominant trait of Bis-
mareks character that stamps him as a
soldier  his unquestioning obedience to
monarchical discipline  is so closely
bound up with the peculiarly German
conceptions of the functions and the pur-
pose of the state, that it will be better
to approach this part of his nature from
the political instead of the military side.

II.

	In no other of the leading countries of
the world has the laissez faire doctrine
had as little influence in political matters
as in Germany. Luther, the fearless
champion of religious individualism, was
in questions of government the most pro-
nounced advocate of paternalism. Kant,
the cool dissector of the human intellect,
was at the same time the most rigid up-
holder of corporate morality. It was
Fichte, the ecstatic proclaimer of the
glory of the individual will, who wrote
this dithyramb on the necessity of the
constant surrender of private interests to
the common welfare: Nothing can live
by itself or for itself; everything lives
in the whole; and the whole continually
sacrifices itself to itself in order to live
anew. This is the law of life. Whatever
has come to the consciousness of existence
must fall a victim to the progress of all
existence. Only there is a difference</PB>

whether you are dragged to the shambles
like a beast with bandaged eyes, or
whether, in full and joyous presentiment
of the life which will spring forth from
your sacrifice, you offer yourself freely
on the altar of eternity.
	Not even Plato and Aristotle went
so far in the deification of the state as
Hegel. And if Hegel declared that the
real office of the state is not to further in-
dividual interests, to protect private pro-
perty, but to be an embodiment of the
organic unity of public life; if he saw
the highest task and the real freedom of
the individual in making himself a part
of this organic unity of public life, he
voiced a sentiment which was fully
shared by the leading classes of the Prus-
sia of his time, and which has since be-
come a part of the political creed of the
Socialist masses all over Germany.
	Here we have the moral background
of Bismarcks internal policy. His mon-
archism rested not only on his personal
allegiance to the hereditary dynasty, al-
though no mediawal knight could have
been more steadfast in his loyalty to his
liege lord than Bismarck was in his un-
swerving devotion to the Hohenzollern
house. His monarchism rested above all
on the conviction that, under the pre
sent conditions of German political life,
no other form of government would in-
sure equally well the fulfillment of the
moral obligations of the state.
	He was by no means blind to the value
of parliamentary institutions. More than
once has he described the English Con-
stitution as the necessary outcome and
the fit expression of the vital forces of
English society. More than once has he
eulogized the sterling political qualities
of English landlordism, its respect for
the law, its common sense, its noble de-
votion to national interests. More than
once has he deplored the absence in Ger-
many of the class which in England
is the main support of the state,  the
class of wealthy and therefore conserva-
tive gentlemen, independent of material
interests, whose whole education is di-
rected with a view to their becoming
statesmen, and whose only aim in life is
to take part in public affairs; and the
absence of a Parliament, like the Eng-
lish, containing two sharply defined par-
ties, whereof one forms a sure and un-
swerving majority which subjects itself
with iron discipline to its ministerial
leaders. We may regret that Bismarck
himself did not do more to develop par-
liamentary discipline; that indeed he
did everything in his power to arrest
the healthy growth of German party
life. But it is at least perfectly clear
that his reasons for refusing to allow the
German parties a controlling influence
in shaping the policy of the government
were not the result of mere despotic ca-
price, but were founded upon thoroughly
German traditions, and upon a thorough-
ly sober, though one - sided view of the
present state of German public affairs.
	To him party government appeared
as much of an impossibility as it had ap-
peared to Hegel. In his opinion the
attempt to establish it would have led
to nothing less than chaos. The Ger-
man parties, as he viewed them, repre-
sented, not the state, not the nation, but
an infinite variety of private and class
interests, the interests of landholders,
traders, manufacturers, laborers, politi-
idans, priests, and so on; each particular
set of interests desiring the particular
consideration of the public treasury, and
refusing the same amount of considera-
tion to every other. It seemed highly
desirable to him, as it did to Hegel, that
all these interests should be heard; that
they should be represented in a Parlia-
ment based upon as wide and liberal a
suffrage as possible. But he thought
that to entrust any one of these interests
with the functions of government would
have been treason to the state; it would
have been class tyranny of the worst
kind.
	The logical outcome of all this was his
conviction of the absolute necessity, for</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00571" SEQ="0571" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="565">	B~smarck as a National Type.	565

Germany, of a strong non-partisan gov-
eminent: a government which should
hold all the conflicting class interests in
check, which should force them into con-
tinual compromises with one another; a
government which should be unrestrict-
ed by any class prejudices, pledges, or
theories,  which should have no other
guiding star than the welfare of the
whole nation. The only basis for such
a government he found in the Prussian
monarchy, with its glorious tradition of
military discipline, of benevolent pater-
nalism, and of self-sacrificing devotion
to national greatness; with its patriotic
gentry, its incorruptible courts, its re-
ligious freedom, its enlightened educa-
tional system, its eflicient and highly
trained civil service. To bow before such
a monarchy, to serve such a state, was
indeed something different from submit-
ting to the chance vote of a parliament-
ary majority; in this bondage even a
Bismarck could find his highest freedom.
	For nearly forty years he bore this
bondage; for twenty-eight he stood in
the place nearest to the monarch him-
self; and not even his enemies have
dared to assert that his political conduct
was guided by other motives than the
consideration of public welfare. Indeed,
if there is any phrase for which he, the
apparent cynic, the sworn despiser of
phrases, seems to have had a certain
weakness, it is scdus publica. To it he
sacrificed his days and his nights; for
it he more than once risked his life; for
it he incurred more hatred and slander
than perhaps any other man of his time;
for it he alienated his best friends; for
it he turned not once or twice, but one
might almost say habitually, against his
own cherished prejudices and convic-
tions. The career of few men shows so
many apparent inconsistencies and con-
trasts. One of his earliest speeches in
the Prussian Landtag was a fervent pro-
test against the introduction of civil mar-
riage; yet the civil marriage clause in
the German constitution is his work. He
was by birth and tradition a believer in
the divine right of kings, yet the king
of Hanover could tell something of the
manner in which Bismarck dealt with the
divine right of kings if it stood in the
way of German unity. He took pride in
belonging to the most feudal aristocracy
of eastern Europe, the Prussian Jun-
kerdom; yet he has done more to up-
root feudal privileges than any other
German statesman since 1848. He glo-
ried in defying public opinion; he wns
wont to say that he felt doubtful about
himself whenever he met with popular
applause; yet he is the founder of the
German Parliament, and he founded it
on direct and universal suffrage. He
was the sworn enemy of the Socialist par-
ty,  he attempted to destroy it root and
branch; yet through the nationalization
of railways and the obligatory insurance
of workmen lie infused more S6~ialism
into German legislation than any other
statesman before him. He began as a
quixotic champion of royal autocracy;
he died the advocate of the German
nation against the capricious mysticism
of imperial omnipotence.
	Truly, a man who could thus sacrifice
his own wishes and instincts to the com-
mon good; who could so completely sink
his own personality in the cause of the
nation; who with such matchless cour-
age defended this cause against attacks
from whatever quarter,  against court
intrigue no less than against demagogues,
 such a man had a right to stand above
parties; and he spoke the truth when,
some years before leaving office, in a
moment of gloom and disappointment he
wrote under his portrait, Patrhe in-
serviendo consumor.

III.

fectly natural antithesis in German na-
tional character. The same people that

nalism, that willingly submits to restric-
tions of personal liberty in matters of</PB>

Bismarek as a
state such as no Englishman would ever
tolerate, is more jealous of its independ-
ence than perhaps any other nation in
matters pertaining to the intellectual, so-
cial, and religious life of the individual.
It seems as if the very pressure from
without had helped to strengthen and en-
rich the life within.
	Not only all the great men of Ger-
man thought, from Luther down to the
Grimms and the Humboldts, have been
conspicuous for their freedom from ar-
tificial conventions, and for the original-
ity and homeliness of their human inter-
course, but even the average German
official  wedded as he may be to his
rank or his title, anxious as he may be
to preserve an outward decorum in exact
keeping with the precise shade of his
public status  is often the most delight-
fully unconventional, good-natured, un-
sophisticated, and even erratic being in
the world, as soon as he has left the
cares of his office behind him. Germany
is the classic land of queer people. It
is the land of Quintus Fixlein, Onkel
Brasig, Leberecht HUhnchen, and the
host of Fliegende Blatter worthies; it
is the land of the beer-garden and the
Kaffekrdnzchen, of the Christmas-tree
and the Whitsuntide merrymaking; it is
the land of country inns and of student
pranks. What more need be said to bring
before ones mind the wealth of hearty
joyfulness, jolly good fellowship, boister-
ous frolic, sturdy humor, simple direct-
ness, and genuinely democratic feeling
that characterizes social life in Germany?
	Still less reason is there for dwelling
on the intellectual and religious inde-
pendence of German character. Absence
of constraint in scientific inquiry and re-
ligious conduct is indeed the very palla-
dium of German freedom. Nowhere else
is higher education so entirely removed
from class distinction as in the country
where the imperial princes are sent to
the same school with the sons of trades-
men and artisans. Nowhere else is there
eo little religious formalism coupled with

such deep religious feeling as in the coun-
try where sermons are preached to empty
benches, while Tannhauser and Lohen-
grin, Wallenstein and Faust, are listened
to with the hush of awe and bated breath
by thousands upon thousands.
	In all these respects  socially, intel-
lectually, religiously  Bismarck was the
very incarnation of German character.
Although an aristocrat by birth and bear-
ing, and although, especially during the
years of early manhood, passionately
given over to the aristocratic habits of
dueling, hunting, swaggering, and ca-
rousing, he was essentially a man of the
people. Nothing was more utterly for-
eign to him than any form of libertinism;
even his eccentricities were of the hardy
homespun sort. He was absolutely free
from social vanity; he detested court
festivities; he set no store by orders or
decorations; the only two among the
innumerable ones conferred upon him
which he is said to have highly valued
were the Prussian order of the Iron
Cross, bestowed for personal bravery on
the battlefield, and the medal for res-
cuing from danger which he received
in 1842 for having saved his groom from
drowning by plunging into the water
after him. What he thought of mean-
ingless titles may be gathered from his
remark anent the bestowal upon him by
the present Emperor of the ducal dig-.
nity: If ever I wish to travel incognito,
I shall call myself Duke of Lauenburg.
	All his instincts were bound up with
the soil from which he had sprung. He
passionately loved the North German
plain, with its gloomy moorlands, its pur-
ple heather, its endless wheat-fields, its
kingly forests, its gentle lakes, and its
superb sweep of sky and clouds. Writ-
ing to his friends when abroad,  he
traveled very little abroad,  he was in
the habit of describing foreign scenery
by comparing it to familiar views and
places on his own estates. During sleep-
less nights in the Chancellery at Ber-
lin there would often rise before him ~</PB>

sudden vision of Varzin, his Pomeranian
country - seat, perfectly distinct in the
minutest particulars, like a great picture
with all its colors fresh,  the green
trees, the sunshine on the stems, the
blue sky above. I saw every individual
tree. Never was he more happy than
when alone with nature. Saturday,
he writes to his wife from Frankfort,
I drove to Rudesheim. There I took
a boat, rowed out on the Rhine, and
swam in the moonlight, with nothing
but nose and eyes out of water, as far
as the Mausethurm near Bingen, where
the bad bishop came to his end. It
gives one a peculiar dreamy sensation
to float thus on a quiet warm night in
the water, gently carried down by the
current, looking above on the heavens
studded with moon and stars, and on
each side the banks and wooded hill~
tops and the battlements of the old
castles bathed in the moonlight, whilst
nothing falls on ones ear but the gentle
splashing of ones movements. I should
like to swim like this every evening.
And what poet has more deeply felt
than he that vague musical longing
which seizes one when far away from
human sounds, by the brookside or the
hillslope? I feel as if I were looking
out on the mellowing foliage of a fine
September day, he writes again to his
wife, health and spirits good, but with
a soft touch of melancholy, a little home-
sickness, a longing for deep woods and
lakes, for a desert, for yourself and the
children, and all this mixed up with a
sunset and Beethoven.
	His domestic affections were by no
means limited to those united to him by
ties of blood; he cherished strong, pa-
triarchal feelings for every member of
his household, past or present. He pos-
sessed in a high degree the German
tenderness for little things. He never
forgot a service rendered to him, how-
ever small. In the midst of the most
engrossing public activity he kept him-

of the management of his estates, so that
his wife could once laughingly say that
a turnip from his own fields interested
him vastly more than all the problems
of international politics.
	His humor, also, was entirely of the
German stamp. It was boisterous, rol-
licking, aggressive, unsparing,  of him-
self as well as of others,  cynic, im-
moderate, but never without a touch of
good nature. His satire was often crush-
ing, never venomous. His wit was racy
and exuberant, never equivocal. Whe-
ther he describes his vis-l~-vis at a hotel
table, his Excellency So and So, as one
of those figures which appear to one
when he has the nightmare,  a fat frog
without legs, who opens his mouth as
wide as his shoulders, like a carpet-bag,
for each bit, so that I am obliged to
hold tight on by the table from giddi-
ness; whether he characterizes his col-
leagues at the Frankfort Bundestag as
mere caricatures of periwig diploma-
tists, who at once put on their official
visage if I merely beg of them a light
to my cigar, and who study their words
and looks with Regensburg care when
they ask for the key of the lavatory
whether he sums up his impression of
the excited, emotional manner in which
Jules Favre pleaded with him for the
peace terms in the words, He evi-
dently took me for a public meeting;
whether he declines to look at the statue
erected to him at Cologne, because he
does nt care to see himself fossilized;
whether he speaks of the unprecedented
popular ovations given to him at his
final departure from Berlin as a first-
class funeral,  there is always the
same childlike directness, the same naive
impulsiveness, the same bantering ear-
nestness, the same sublime contempt for
sham and hypocrisy.
	And what man has been more truth..
ful in intellectual and religious matters?
He, the man of iron will, of ferocious
temper, was at the same time the cool-
est reasoner, the most unbiased thinker.</PB>

He willingly submitted to the judgment
of experts, he cheerfully acknowledged
intellectual talent in others, he took a
pride in having remained a learner all
his life, but he hated arrogant amateur-
ishness. He was not a churchgoer; he
declined to be drawn into the circle of
religious schemers and reactionary f a-
natics; he would occasionally speak in
contemptuous terms of the creed of
court chaplains, but writing to his wife
of that historic meeting with Napoleon
in the lonely cottage near the battlefield
of Sedan, he said: A powerful con-
trast with our last meeting in the Tuile-
ries in 67. Our conversation was a dif-
ficult thing, if I wanted to avoid touch-
ing on topics which could not but affect
painfully the man whom Gods mighty
hand had cast down. And more than
once he gave vent to reflections like
these: For him who does not believe
 as I do from the bottom of my heart
 that death is a transition from one
existence to another, and that we are
justified in holding out to the worst of
criminals in his dying hour the comfort-
ing assurance, morsjanua vital,  I say
that for bim who does not share that
conviction, the joys of this life must
possess so high a value that I could al-
most envy him the sensations they must
procure him. Or these: Twenty
years hence, or at most thirty, we shall
be past the troubles of this life, whilst
our children will have reached our pre-
sent standpoint, and will discover with
astonishment that their existence (but
now so brightly begun) has turned the
corner and is going downhill. Were
that to be the end of it all, life would
not be worth the trouble of dressing and
undressing every day.

tions. But after all, the personality of
a man like Bismarck is not exhausted
by the qualities which lie has in com-
mon with his people, however sublimated
these qualities may be in him. His in-
nermost life belongs to himself alone, or
is shared, at most, by the few men of
the worlds history who, like him, tower
in splendid solitude above the waste of
the ages. In the Middle High German
Alexanderlied there is an episode which
most impressively brings out the impel-
ling motive of such Titanic lives. On
one of his expeditions Alexander pene-
trates into the land of Scythian barba-
rians. These childlike people are so
contented with their simple, primitive
existence that they beseech Alexander
to give them immortality. He answers
that this is not in his power. Sur-
prised, they ask why, then, if he is only a
mortal, he is making such a stir in the
world. Thereupon he answers: The
Supreme Power has ordained us to car-
ry out what is in us. The sea is given
over to the whirlwind to plough it up.
As long as life lasts and I am master of
my senses, I must bring forth what is in
me. What would life be if all men in
the world were like you? These words
might have been spoken by Bismarck.
Every word, every act of his public ca-
reer, gives us the impression of a man
irresistibly driven on by some overwhelm-
ing, mysterious power. He was not
an ambitious schemer, like Beaconsfield
or Napoleon; he was not a moral en-
thusiast, like Gladstone or Cavour. If
he had consulted his private tastes and
inclinations, he would never have wield-
ed the destinies of an empire. Indeed,
he often rebelled against his task; again
and again he tried to shake it off; and
the only thing which again and again
brought him back to it was the feeling,
I must; I cannot do otherwise. If ever
there was a man in whom Fate revealed
its moral sovereignty, that man was Bis-
marek.

THE CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE SAND.

during the triumph of naturalism. But
now that naturalism has grown to a

ing and frequented Bohemian society.
She informs one of her correspondents
that her main item of expense is for
tobacco. Like all the romantic writers,
she professed the religion of passion, an
ideal to which she has given expression
in L6lia.  For poetic souls, she says
in this work, the sentiment of worship
enters even into the love of the senses.~~
Of this mixture of idealism and sensual-
ity there is only too much in the whole
modern conception of love. We find in
Petrarek one of the earliest instances of
this epicurean use of the religious senti-
ment, that would bring the ideal down
from heaven and throw its celestial gla-
mour over earthly passions. But the
whole tendency has perhaps reached its
culmination in the extraordinary product
known as romantic love, that mortal
chimera which, in the words of MI.
Rend Doumic, has raged for a century
in French literature,  which has in-
fected peoples minds, perverted their
ideas, disturbed society, undermined mo-
rality, and made thousands of victims, of
whom George Sand and Alfred de Mus-
set are only the most illustrious. Her
affair with Alfred de Musset, we need
hardly add, as well as one or two other
like experiments in romantic love, ended
for her only in disillusion,  disillusion
so complete that for a time she fell into
utter despair, and contempt for herself
and others~ If I should tell you, she
confesses later to a friend, the point to
which I pushed my abhorrence of every-
thing, my horror of existence, I should
seem to you to be relating an idle tale.
She speaks of her anti-social spirit,
of her hatred of all men, and says
she would not stir to save her neighbors
child from drowning. She was haunted
by thoughts of suicide. Ten years
ago, she wrote in 1845 to Mazzini, I
was in Switzerland; I was still in the
age of tempests; I made up my mind
even then to meet you, if I should resist
the temptation to suicide which pursued
me upon the glaciers. She finally re
tired to Nohant, where she was to pass
the rest of her life. Her youth, to use her
own expression, had come to an end in
the midst of convulsions and groans.
We can follow in her letters the process
of reflection by which she arrived at a
state of comparative calm. I have had
a terrible duel with myself, a gigantic
struggle with my ideal; I have been
profoundly broken and wounded; now
I am vegetating quietly enough. Her
return to sanity and self-possession was
made easier by her freedom from self-
love; for, whatever misuse she had made
of the ideal, she had not used it to ideal-
ize herself. She was not infected,
to borrow her own phrase, with that
immense vanity which characterizes the
men of the reign of Louis Philippe. She
began to have doubts about the divine
nature of romantic love. At present I
am going to have the courage to say it,
she writes in one of her recently pub-
lished letters to Sainte-Beuve: the loves
which make us suffer are not the loves
that God intended for us; and we are
deceived in thinking so. Let the reign
of truth once come,  and I believe in
this reign of truth, though I know it will
not be in my day, and what we suf-
fered will no longer have a name in hu-
man language.
	In the meanwhile, a new form of faith
was beginning to rise in the mind of
George Sand on the ruins of the religion
of passion. As for me, she declares,
the teachings of Leroux have resolved
my doubts and founded my religious
faith. I am plunged in the doctrines
of socialism. I have found in them
strength, faith, hope, and the patient and
persevering love of humanity,  trea-
sures of my youth, which I had dreamed
of in Catholicism. It is worth noting
that almost at the same time that George
Sand was thus arriving at the gospel of
humanity, Renan, escaped from St. Sul-
pice, was proclaiming the religion of
science. It is curious to observe, in the
case of both Renan and George Sand,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00577" SEQ="0577" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="571">	The Correspondence of George Sand.	511

how much easier it is to throw off the
old dogmas than to free the mind from
the forms of thought and feeling in which
a century-long inheritance of Catholicism
has moulded it. Just as Renan in his
earlier work arrives at the conception of
a scientific infallibility, a scientific pope,
a scientific heaven and hell, and even of
a God created by scientists, so George
Sand transfers to socialism the whole vo-
cabulary of Christian mysticism. She
speaks of the social rebirth to be
brought about by France, that Christ of
nations, of  social saints, of  social
martyrs, and so on. At the news of
the outbreak of the Revolution of 1848,
she hurried to Paris in boundless exul-
tation. And then, on the complete col-
lapse of all the social dreams and social
dreamers, she again fell into deep dis-
couragement. She found that Leroux,
such an admirable man in the ideal
life, floundered hopelessly when brought
into contact with reality. And Leroux,
in this respect, was symbolical of the
whole movement. She speaks of her
utter depression after the days of
June. She had made the painful discov-
ery that there entered into the composi-
tion of that humanity she had so ideal-
ized a large number of knaves, a very
large number of lunatics, and an im-
mense number of fools. George Sand
remained almost to the very end niore or
less the dupe of those three great words,
Nature, Progress, and Humanity, the in-
discriminate use of which has worked
such havoc in the thinking of the past
two centuries. Yet if she did not give
up her dreams of social rebirth, she
at least saw that they would have to be
adjourned to an indefinite future: 
And long the way appears which seemed so
short
To the less practiced eye of sanguine youth;
And high the mountain-tops in cloudy air,
The mountain-tops where is the throne of
Truth.
It cost her a heavy effort, she owned,
to pass from vast illusions to complete
disillusion.
	But she again mastered her despair,
and in the very midst of the Second
Empire, in the midst of the densest ma-
terialism the world has seen since the
Roman decadence, she founded anew her
faith in the ideal, and this time on a
larger and surer base. She gradually
awoke to the perception that the sal-
vation of France was not to be through
politics, and that the indefinite future
 progress of humanity was not so impor-
tant as the immediate definite progress
of the individual. She saw that what
was most needed was a new direction
given to mens hearts and consciences.~~
They are the slaves of circumstance,
she declares of the politicians of her day,
because they are the born slaves of
themselves. And again: Duty brings
with it its own reward. Calm has been
restored to my spirit, and faith has re-
turned. Everything passes away, 
youth, passions, illusions, and the desire
to live. One thing only remains,  the
integrity of the heart. The heart grows
not old, but, on the contrary, is fresher
and stronger at sixty than at thirty, if
only it is allowed to have its own way.
	It was toward the beginning of the
last period of her life, the period of ma-
turity and insight, that George Sand be-
came acquainted with Flaubert. They
were drawn together by a certain native
distinction of character, by a certain deli-
cacy and disinterestedness they observed
in each other, but especially by the fact
that they were impenitent romanticists
in the midst of a generation hostile to
romanticism. You will always remain
twenty-five, she wrote to him, in vir-
tue of all kinds of ideas which have be-
come antiquated, if we are to believe the
senile young men of to-day.
	Apart from these points of contact, it
would be hard to imagine two persons in
more radical disagreement than George
Sand and Flaubert. She herself avows to
him that there surely never were two
workmen as different as we are; and
Flaubert, wondering at the large and</PB>

easy improvisation of George Sand, re-
plies, You dont know what it is to
spend a whole day with your head in
your hands, racking your miserable brain
in the search for an epithet. The letters
they exchanged owe ninch of their in-
terest to the way in which the traits of
each writer are thus constantly thrown
into relief by opposition and contrast.
George Sand urges Flaubert to exercise
his will, and Flaubert answers that he is
as fatalistic as a Turk. You believe
in life and love it, says Flaubert, and
life fills me with distrust. It s strange
how little faith I naturally have in hap-
piness. I had in my very youth a com-
plete presentiment of life. It was like
a sickly kitchen smell escaping from a
basement window. Yes, replies
George Sand, life is a terrible mixture
of pleasure and pain; yet we must
suffer, weep, hope, be,  in short, we
must exercise our will in every direc-
tion. You at the first leap mount to
heaven, he says elsewhere, while I,
poor devil, am glued to the earth as
though by leaden soles. In spite of
your great sphinx eyes, you have always
seen the world as through a golden mist,
whereas I am constantly dissecting;
and when I have finally discovered the
corruption in anything that is supposed
to be pure, the gangrene in its fairest
parts, then I raise my head and laugh.
Flaubert talks of his need of extraor-
dinary and factitious environments.
You might leave me, says George
Sand, whole hours under a tree, or be-
fore two burning sticks, with the certain-
ty that I should find something to interest
me. I have learned so well how to live
outside of myself. I was not so always.
I too have been young and subject to in-
digestions, but all that is ended.
	Finally Flaubert tells George Sand
that the artist must no~ express his own
feelings in what he writes. Not put
ones feelings into what one writes! re-
torts George Sand. I dont understand
you at all,  oh no, not in the least.
As a matter of fact, Flaubert had ob-
served that the greatest works of art are
impersonal; and not being able to con-
ceive of a region of impersonal human
emotion, he decided to eliminate emotion
altogether, and to arrive at least at the
impersonality of the naturalist. We
must treat men, he says, as though
they were mastodons or crocodiles. And
so he resolutely cut out from what he
wrote the very thoughts and feelings he
was most burning to utter. It is odd,
writes George Sand, but there s a
whole side of you which does nt appear
in your books. It would be hard, in-
deed, to imagine a more curious contrast
than that between the published work of
Flaubert and the medley of interjections,
ejaculations, slang, profanity, and ob-
scenity we find in his letters.
	Paradoxical as the statement is, Flau-
bert and other French men of letters
of the middle of the century who have
been reproached with impassibility are
in reality about the most subjective, the
most completely self-centred, writers in
literature. The whole psychology of the
school of art for arts sake is revealed
in these letters of one of its chief repre-
sentatives. The men who profess this
doctrine have, for the most part, carried
over to art habits of thought, and espe-
cially modes of sensibility, which derive
from Catholicism. Just as we have found
in George Sand the gospel of humanity,
and in Renan the religion of science, so
we fiuid in Flaubert the fanaticism of art.
He preaches abstinence, renunciation,
and mortification of the flesh in the name
of art. He excommunicates those who de-
part from artistic orthodoxy, and speaks
of heretics and disbelievers in art with a
ferocity worthy of a Spanish inquisitor.
	Unfortunately, Flaubert was unable to
attain to that pure artistic ecstasy, that
literary delirium, to which he aspired.
If he was at variance with George Sand,
he was hardly less at variance with him-
self. He tells us that his intellectual
origins are all in Don Quixote, which he</PB>

had learned by heart before he knew
how to read. There was going on with-
in him, in fact, a warfare between me-
dhuval reverie and modern positivism not
unlike that which Cervantes has symbol-
ized in his masterpiece. Born in the
period of transition from an age of sen-
timent to an age of scientific analysis,
Flaubert hung suspended between two
worlds, and was unable to enjoy the full
benefit of either. I have contradic-
tory ideals, he exclaimed, and the
consequence is hesitation, halting, im-
potence! If he burst into tears under
the stress of lyric emotion, his first im-
pulse was to observe himself in a look-
ing-glass. He became the founder of
naturalism, which he abhorred; on the
other hand, if he tried to launch out into
some vast poetical subject, he found that
his lyric sense had been eaten away by
analysis. Like many another writer of
the present century, he tried to hide his
lack of inner vitality under intellectual
accumulation. He tells us that be had
read and annotated three hundred vol-
umes as a partial preparation for writing
Bouvard et P6cuchet. What predomi-
nated in him, however, was his catholic
sensibility, and his consequent hatred of
modern life. Indeed, we shall not un-
derstand Flaubert and one whole school
of nineteenth-century artists, especially
the so-called decadents, unless we see in
them men whose souls are still steeped in
medheval reverie, and who are unable to
acquiesce in our modern rectangular civi-
lization founded on scientific analysis 
Tout est bien balay4 sur vos chemins de fer,
Tont est grand, tout est beau, mais on meurt
dans votre air.
	I am a Catholic! exclaims Flaubert.
I have in my heart something of the
green ooze of the Norman cathedrals.
And speaking of Salammbo: Few per-
sons will guess how melancholy a man
must be to try to resuscitate ancient Car-
thage. That is the Theban desert to
which my horror of modern life has
driven me. This horror of modern life
grew upon Flaubert, until he came at last
to live in a chronic state of indignation,
in a white heat of fury at his contem-
poraries. I have written it,~ he says
of Bouvard et P6cuchet, in the hope of
being able to spit into it some of the bile
which is choking me.
	I should like to see you, writes
George Sand, less indignant at other
peoples stupidity. Flaubert, however,
was unwilling to part with his indigna-
tion. It was pride and the sense of
personal distinction, he is careful to tell
us, which sustained him in his life of
solitary devotion to art; he needed his
indignation to assure himself that he
really was superior to the people about
him. If it were not for my indig-
nation, he confesses in one place, I
should fall flat. Unfortunately, we
come to resemble what we habitually
contemplate. By dint of railing at
idiots, writes Flaubert, one runs the
risk of becoming idiotic ones self. And
he says of his two bourgeois, Bouvard
and P~cuchet, Their stupidity is my
stupidity, and its killing me.
	George Sand takes Flaubert to task,
with admirable tact, for thus tormenting
himself with false theories of art. Tal-
ent, she says, imposes duties; and
art for arts sake is an empty word.
Beauty is not in itself a cause, but a re-
sult, the outcome of the harmony of all
the parts either in the life of an individ-
ual or in that of a people. Beauty, we
may add, is, in itself, only the element
of illusion. The man who pursues it as
a thing apart is trying to divorce form
from substance, and will spend his life,
Ixion - like, embracing phantoms. 0
Art, Art, exclaims Flaubert, bitter
deception, nameless phantom, which
gleams and lures us to our ruin! He
speaks elsewhere of the chimera of
style which is wearing him out soul and
body. George Sand tells us that as
she grew older she came more and more
to put truth above beauty, and good-
ness before strength. I have reflected</PB>

a great deal on what is true, she writes,
and in this search for truth the senti-
ment of my ego has gradually disap-
peared. Flaubert, on the contrary, in
becoming a chercheur dexquis, in con-
secrating his life to the quest for beauty,
had succeeded only in intensifying the
sentiment of his ego and in irritating
his nerves. Attaching an almost reli-
gious importance to ~esthetic sensation,
he had been led to humor all the whims
of a morbid sensibility. He had fallen
into the state which the French describe
by the untranslatable word nostalgie,
the desire to jump out of ones skin,
to be where one is not; he had become
the victim of that artistic hyperiesthesia
from which so many French writers
since Rousseau have suffered. He com-
plains in his old age: My sensibility is
sharper than a razors edge; the creak-
ing of a door, the face of a bourgeois,
an absurd statement, set my heart to
throbbing, and completely upset me.
	We are possibly justified in inferring
from the life of Flaubert, and that of
others of his school, the futility of art
when not subordinated to some principle
higher than itself. If any one prefer
beauty to virtue, says Plato, what is
this but the real and utter dishonor of
the soul ? Hardly anywhere else in
literature will one find such accents of
bitterness, such melancholy welling up
unbidden from the very depths of the
heart, as in the devotees of art for
arts sake,  Flaubert, Leconte de Lisle,
Th6ophile Gautier. George Sand ex-
presses a natural surprise at the agitation
in which Flaubert lives at Croisset, 
that delightful retreat where everything
breathes comfort and tranquillity.
	We need not suppose that George
Sand was entirely right, and Flaubert
entirely wrong, in the theory and prac-
tice of art. We can agree with Flaubert
in thinking that composition with the
great masters was accompanied by fewer
throes and paroxysms, by less effort and
anguish, than with him. On the other
hand, composition with the great mas-
ters was not a pure improvisation, as in
the case of George Sand; they did not
write, as we are to infer she did, in a
half-somnambulistic condition. I am a
mere wind-harp, she tells Flaubert. It
is the other who plays upon my heart at
will. . . . When I think of it I am filled
with fright, and say to myself, I am no-
thing, nothing at all. Genius, George
Sand never tires of repeating, comes
from the heart,  a feminine theory of
genius which offends less in the mouth
of George Sand than when professed by
men like Lamartine and Alfred de Mus-
set. Yet it was a too unquestioning obe-
dience to the promptings of the heart that
kept George Sand from attaining perfec-
tion. Life, she confesses, carries me
off my feet. She is swept away by her
feelings and sentiments, her affections
and sympathies; so that Flaubert might
well write of her: Madame Sand is too
benign and angelical. It may be said,
in justification of Flauberts view, that
the New Testament in one passage pro-
mises the kingdom of heaven to the vio-
lent. It is the lack of power of concen-
tration, of fiery intensity, and at the same
time the lack of that infinite painstaking
in detail possessed by Flaubert, which re-
moves George Sand from the first rank
of artists. I am not, she admits of
herself, the ideal artist. I am too
fond of sewing and scrubbing children;
	and then, besides, I am not a lover
of perfection. I feel perfection, but I
cannot make it manifest.
	The main event that came to disturb
the tranquillity of George Sand in her
old age was the Franco-Prussian war and
the Commune. I am sick with the sick-
ness of my country and my race! she
exclaims, after the Commune. I wish
that I had died without learning that bar-
barism is still so alive and active in the
world. And again: I judged of oth-
ers by myself; I had done a great deal
toward mending my own character; I had
quenched useless and dangerous ebulhi</PB>

tions; I had sown grass and flowers upon
my volcanoes, and I fancied that every-
body was capable of self-enlightenment
and self-restraint. And now I have been
all at once awakened from my dream to
find a generation divided between idiocy
and delirium tremens. Flaubert, who,
whatever his faults, was not a dupe of
humanitarianism, declared, as early as
1848, that Leroux and the other Socialists
were not modern men,  that they were
still up to their necks in the Middle
Ages; and he saw in the Commune a
manifestation of medhevalism. George
Sand, too, taught by experience, was rap-
idly ridding herself, during the last years
of her life, of what was still medheval in
her ways of thinking. This fact appears
in her increasing distrust of absolute a
priori formuhe. She was gradually at-
taining to the insight to which Emerson
has given expression in his essay on Coni-
pensation,  the insight that no truth is
true unless balanced by its counter-truth.
Dont you see, she says to one of her
political friends, that the Catholic priest
is supremely intolerant because he rejects
absolutely the opposite view? Down
with the priests in power, whatever garb
they may happen to wear. The Repub-
lic will take care of itself, if it is not
imposed as a dogma. The principles
of 93, she says elsewhere, have been
our ruin; the Reign of Terror and St.
Bartholomews Day are an expression of
the same spirit.
	With the disappearance of her last
humanitarian hopes, the evolution of the
character of George Sand may be said
to be complete. I believe, she writes
to Alexandre Dumas fils, henceforward
without illusion, and that is the secret of
all my little strength. This survival
of faith is indeed the fact most worthy
of note in a study of the inner life of
George Sand. The great historical error
of Christianity has been to confound
faith with credulity; and for the vast
majority of modern men, faith has per-
ished along with the creeds with which
it had been identified. It is the distinc-
tion of George Sand to have rescued re-
peatedly the precious principle of belief
from the wreck of false ideals, and to
have had a faith so robust as to outlive
shock upon shock of disillusion. In her
old age she arrived more and more at a
faith free from illusion,  faith founded
on the simple feeling, as she expresses
it, that the whole is greater and better
than we are, and on the sentiment of
the divine, entirely apart from any at-
tempt to confine it in a formula.
	If man has drunk at the cup of eter-
nal truth, she says, he no longer takes
sides too passionately for or against rela-
tive and ephemeral truth. Together
with faith, there entered into the life of
George Sand joy, certainty, tranquillity,
the sense of conduct, and the belief in
the freedom of the will,  good and de-
sirable things all, which seem to be dis-
appearing from the world with the dis-
appearance of faith.
	I wish to see man as he is, she
writes to Flaubert. He is not good or
bad: he is good and bad. But he is
something else besides: being good and
bad, he has an inner force which leads
him to be very bad and a little good, or
else very good and a little bad. I
have often wondered, she adds, why
your Education Sentimentale, in spite
of its excellence of form, was so ill re-
ceived by the public, and the reason, as
it seems to me, is that its characters
are passive,  that they do not act upon
themselves. It is this power to act upon
himself, precisely what is most human
in man, that Flaubert neglected when he
proposed to study men as he would mas-
todons or crocodiles.
	The power which George Sand showed
to act on herself is what gives her life
its peculiar interest. She might justly
say of herself, I cannot forget that my
personal victory over despair has been
the work of my will, and of a new way
 of understanding life which is the exact
opposite of the one I held formerly.</PB>

How different is the weary cry of Flau-
bert: I am like a piece of clock-work.
What I am doing to-day I shall be doing
to-morrow; I did the same thing yes-
terday; I was exactly the same man
ten years ago. Or compare the life of
George Sand with that of Victor Hugo,
who, as the ripe fruit of his meditations,
yields nothing better than the apotheosis
of Robespierre and Marat.
	Tame remarks of Sainte-Beuve that he
was the only French writer of the pre-
sent century, besides George Sand, who
showed this power of continuous devel-
opment. George Sand, however, is supe-
rior to Sainte-Beuve in that her growth
is symmetrical, instead of being the ex-
pansion of a single faculty. She grew
toward her ideal as the plant grows to-
ward the sun, and not like the modern
specialist, mechanically in one direction.
We find in Sainte-Beuve something of
that undue confidence in intellectual ma-
chinery, of that abuse of the brain, which
has followed in the trail of the scientific
spirit. Poor Sainte-Beuve, writes
George Sand, his intelligence has per-
haps developed; but the intelligence does
not suffice for the purposes of life, and
it does not teach us how to die. You
have a better sense for total truth (in
vrai total), she tells another correspond-
ent, than Sainte-Beuve, Renan, and
Littr~. They have fallen into the Ger-
man rut: therein lies their weakness.
And Flaubert writes to George Sand:
What amazes and delights me is the
strength of your whole personality, not
that of the brain alone.
	Thus, toward the end of her career,
George Sand became increasingly free
from that nineteenth-century intellectual-
ism which so marred the work of the
closing years of George Eliot. I feel,
she writes, that I am coming to be less
and less a Christian, and I perceive daily
another light dawning beyond that hori-
zon of life toward which I am advancing
with ever greater tranquillity. In spite
of what George Sand says about not be-
ing a Christian, it would be easy enough
to show that many of her faults and
nearly all her virtues are a direct in-
heritance from Christianity,  the Chris-
tianity of St. Francis rather than that
of St. Thomas Aquinas. A study of her
character, indeed, derives its main inter-
est from the fact that she was able to
make what Tame calls the painful
transition from an hereditary faith to a
personal conviction.
	We are living in an age when the
principle of choice, the sense of direc-
tion, is more important than ever before,
and at the same time more difficult of
attainment. We are under special obli-
gation to those who, like George Sand,
have been successful in thus carrying
over what was most vital in the old be-
lief, and in combining it with what is
most advanced in modern thought. In
this respect, George Sand takes rank
with Emerson among the pioneers of the
idealism of the future; and like Emer-
son, she remained true to the ideal with-
out falling into morbid self-conscious-
ness. She perceived no less plainly than
Carlyle the degeneracy of the humanity
of her day from loss of hold on the
moral law, but she did not therefore
have a vision of her contemporaries as a
lot of apes chattering on the shores of
the Dead Sea. For this reason finally
George Sand will be remembered not
merely as a great literary artist; she
will also remain in memory as one of the
few who, in an age of great enlighten-
ment and little light, have persevered in
the cult of the ideal, in the exercise of
in sens conte~platif cit reside Ut foi
invincible,  the contemplative sense
wherein resides invincible faith. And
the passages that bear most striking wit-
ness to her use of this well-nigh obso-
lete sense are contained in her corre-
spondence.

COLONIAL LESSONS OF ALASKA.

And	there s never a law of God or man runs
north of Fifty-Three.


	THE United States is about to enter
on an experience which the London
Speaker cleverly describes as compul-
sory imperialism. Wisely or not, will-
ingly or not, we have assumed duties to-
ward alien races which can be honorably
discharged only by methods foreign to
our past experience. In the interests of
humanity, our armies have entered the
mismanaged territories of Spain. The
interests of humanity demand that they
should stay there, and the duties we have
hastily assumed cannot be discharged
within a single generation.
	It is an axiom of democracy that  gov-
ernment must derive its just powers from
the consent of the governed. This has
been the fundamental tenet of our polit-
ical system. But government by the peo-
ple is not necessarily good government.
It can never be ideally good until indi-
vidual intelligence and patriotism rise to
a higher level than they have yet reached
in any nation whatever. It is possible
that government by the people may be
intolerably bad. This is the case where
individual indifference and greed make
effective codperation impossible. Such
a condition exists in several of the so-
called republics of the New World, for
whose independence our Monroe Doc-
trine has been solicitous in the past. Such
will be the case with the Spanish colonies
of to-day, if we leave them to their own
devices. For the civic ideas of these peo
plc and of their self-constituted leaders
rise to no higher plane than those of the
KIPLING.	vulgar despots from whom they have so
long suffered.
	In such cases as these, a government,
for the time at least, may derive just
powers otherwise than from the con-
sent of the governed. It may justify
itself by being good government. This
is, indeed, the justification of the excel-
lent paternal despotism by which Diaz
holds Mexico in the hollow of his hand.
It is the foundation of the imperialism
of Great Britain. Wherever the flag of
England floats it teaches respect for law.
There is but one political lesson more
important, and that lesson is respect for
the individual man. To teach the one
has been the mission of England; to
teach the other has been the glory of the
United States.
	The essential function of British impe-
rialism is to carry law and order, the
Pax Britannica, to all parts of the globe.
This function has been worked out in
three ways, corresponding to Englands
three classes of tributary districts or colo-
nies. The first class consists of regions
settled and civilized by Englishmen al-
ready imbued with the spirit of law, and
capable of taking care of themselves. In
cur day such colonies are self-governing,
and the bond of imperialism is little more
than a treaty of perpetual friendship.
Over the local affairs of Canada, for ex-
ample, England exerts no authority, and
claims none. The sovereignty of the
home government rests on tradition, and</PB>

it is maintained through mutual consid-
eration and mutual respect.
	A second class of colonies consists of
military posts, strategic points of war or
of commerce, wrested from some weaker
nation at one time or another in the mili-
tant past. In the control of these outposts
the consent of the governed plays no
part. The justifi~ation of Englands rule
lies in the use she makes of it. The in-
habitants of Gibraltar, for instance, count
no more than so many camp follow-
ers. They remain through military suf-
ferance, and the forms of martial law
suffice for all the government they need.
	The third class of colonies is made
up of conquered or bankrupt nations, 
people whose own governmental forms
were so intolerable that Englands pa-
ternalism was forced to take them in
hand. These countries still govern them-
selves in one fashion or another, but
each act of their rulers is subject to
the veto of the British colonial office.
Said England unto Pharaoh, I will
make a man of you; and with Pha-
raoh, as with other irresponsibles of the
tropics, England has in some degree
succeeded. But this success has been
attained only through the strictest disci-
pline of military methods; not by the
method by which we have made a man
of Brother Jonathan, not by the means
through which republics make free citi-
zens out of the masses of which they are
constituted. England has thus become
the guardian of the weak nations of the
earth, the police force of the unruly, the
assignee of the bankrupt. England, as
Benjamin Franklin said a century and a
half ago, is an island which, compared
to America, is but a stepping-stone in a
brook, with scarce enough of it above
water to keep ones shoes dry. Yet,
by the force of arms, the force of trade,
and the force of law, she has become the
ruler of the earth. It is English brain
and English muscle which hold the world
together, and have made it an Anglo-Sax-
on planet. The final secret of Englands
strength lies, as I have said, in her re-
spect for law. Good government is the
justification of British imperialism. If
victories at sea, happy accident, the needs
of humanity, manifest destiny, or any
combination of events force foreign do-
minion on the United States, American
imperialism must have the same justifi-
cation.
	It is a common saying of the day that
the American flag, wherever once raised,
must never be hauled down. This would
have the ring of higher patriotism, were
another resolve coupled with it: the stars
and stripes shall never bring bad govern-
ment,  shall never wave over misrule,
injustice, waste, or neglect. Whatever
lands or people may come under our flag,
they are entitled to good government, the
best that we can give them. This should
be better than we give ourselves, for it is
not accompanied by the advantages of
self-government.
	Imperialism can succeed only along
lines such as England has already laid
down. In the hands of all other nations
 except thrifty Holland  the colony
has been a source of corruption and de-
cay. It will be so with us, if we follow
the prevalent methods of waste and neg-
lect. It is not for the colonies to make
us wealthy through taxation and trade.
That is the outworn conception which
we have forced Spain to abandon. It is
for us to enrich them through enterprise
and law. There are duties as well as
glories inherent in dominion, and the
duties are by far the more insistent.

	For an object lesson illustrating meth-
ods to be avoided in the rule of our fu-
ture colonies we have not far to seek.
Most forms of governmental pathology
are exemplified in the history of Alaska.
From this history it is my purpose to
draw certain lessons which may be use-
ful in our future colonial experience.
	Thirty years ago (1867) the United
States purchased from Russia the vast
territory of Alaska, rich in native re</PB>

sources, furs, fish, lumber, and gold, thinly
populated with half-civilized tribes from
whose consent no government could de-
rive just powers nor any other. In the
nature of things, the region as a whole
must be incapable of taking care of it-
self, in the ordinary sense in which states,
counties, and cities in the United States
look after their own affairs. The town
meeting idea on which our democracy is
organized could have no application in
Alaska, for Alaska is not a region of
homes and householders. The widely
separated villages and posts have few
interests in common. The settlements
are scattered along a wild coast, inacces-
sible one to another; most of the natives
are subject to an alien priesthood, the
white men knowing no law of God or
man. With these elements, a civic feel-
ing akin to the civic life in the United
States can in no way be built up.
	It is a common saying among Ameri-
cans in the north that they are not in
Alaska for their health. They are there
for the money to be made, and for that
only; caring no more for the country
than a fisherman cares for a discarded
oyster-shell. Of the few thousand who
were employed there before the mining
excitement began, probably more than
half returned to San Francisco in the
winter. Their relation to the territory
was and is commercial only, and not
civil.
	Alaska has an area nearly one fifth
as large as the rest of the United States,
and a coast line as long as all the rest.
Outside the gold fields the permanent
white population is practically confined
to the coast, and only in two small vil-
lages, Juneau and Sitka, can homes in
the American sense be said to exist.
Even these towns, relatively large and
near together, are two days journey
apart, with communication, as a rule.
once a week.
	When Alaska came into our hands,
we found there a native population of
about 32,000. Of these, about 12,000 
Thlinkits, Tinnehs, Hydas, etc.  are
more or less properly called Indians. Of
the rest, about 18,000 Innuits, or Eski-
mos, and some 2500 Aleuts  are allied
rather to the Mongolian races of Asia.
There were about 2000 Russian Creoles
and half-breeds living with the Aleuts
and Innuits, and in general constituting
a ruling class among them, besides a few
Americans, mostly traders and miners.
	Then, as now, the natives in Alaska
were gentle and childlike; some of them
with a surface civilization, others living
in squalid fashion in filthy sod houses.
They all supported themselves mainly by
hunting and fishing. Dried salt salmon,
or ukl, was the chief article of diet, and
the luxuries, which as time went on be-
came necessities of civilization,  flour,
tea, sugar, and tobacco,were purchased
by the sale of valuable furs, especially
those of the sea otter and the blue fox.
The Greek Church, in return for its min-
istrations, received, as a rule, one skin in
every nine taken by the hunters. The
boats of the natives outside the timbered
region of southeastern Alaska were made
of the skin of the gray sea lion, which had
its rookeries at intervals along the coast.
With the advent of Americans the sea
lion became rare in southern Alaska,
great numbers being wantonly shot be-
cause they were big game; and the na-
tives in the Aleutian region were forced
to secure sea lion skins by barter with
the tribes living farther to the north.
This process was facilitated by the Alas-
ka Commercial Company, which main-
tained its trading-posts along the coast,
exchanging for furs, walrus tusks, and
native baskets the articles needed or
craved by the natives.
	Of all articles held by the latter for
exchange, the fur of the sea otters was
by far the most important. Since these
animals were abundant throughout the
Aleutian region thirty years ago, and the
furs were valued at from $300 to $1000
each, their hunters became relatively
wealthy, and the little Aleut villages be-</PB>

came abodes of comparative comfort.
In the settlement of Belkofski, on the
peninsula of Alaska, numbering 165 per-
sons all told, I found in the Greek church
a communion service of solid gold, and
over the altar was a beautiful painting, 
small in size, but exquisitely finished, 
which had been bought in St. Petersburg
for $250. When these articles were pur-
chased, Belkofski was a centre for the
sea otter chase. With wise government,
this condition of prosperity might have
continued indefinitely. But we have al-
lowed the whole herd to be wasted. The
people of Belkofski can now secure no-
thing which the world cares to buy. As
they have no means of buying, the com-
pany has closed its trading-post, after a
year or two of losses and charity. The
people have become dependent on the
dress and food of civilization. Suffering
for want of sugar, flour, tobacco, and tea,
which are now necessities, and having no
way of securing material for boats, they
are abjectly helpless. I was told in 1897
that the people of Wosnessenski Island
were starving to death, and that Belkof-
ski, the next to starve, had sent them a
relief expedition. I have no information
as to conditions in 1898, but certainly
starvation is imminent in all the vari-
ous settlements dependent on the coni-
panys store and on the sea otter.1 Some
time ago it was reported that at Port
Etches the native population was already
huddled together in the single cellar of
an abandoned warehouse, and that other
villages to the eastward were scarcely
better housed. However this may be,
starvation is inevitable along the whole
line of the southwestern coast. From

	1 In 1897, the trading-posts of Akutan, San-
nok, Morjovi, Wosnesseoski, Belkofski, Cher-
nofski, Kashega, Makushin, and Bjorka were
abandoned by the Alaska Commercial Com-
pany, while the stores at Atka and Attn were
turned over to a former agent.
	2 In Unga the Aleuts find work in the gold
mines, at Unalaska in the lading of vessels.
Very lately extensive shipyards have been es-
tablished at Unalaska, and natives from the
Prince Williams Sound to Attu, a dis-
tance of nearly 1800 miles, there is not
a village (except LTnalaska and Unga 2)
where the people have any sure means
of support. Reconcentrado between
Arctic cold and San Francisco greed,
these people, 1165 in number, have no
outlook save extermination. For per-
mitting them to face such a doom we
have not even the excuse we have had
for destroying the Indians. We want
neither the land nor the property of the
Aleuts. When their tribes shall have
disappeared, their islands are likely to
remain desolate forever.
	The case of the sea otter merits fur-
ther examination. The animal itself is
of the size of a large dog, with long full
gray fur, highly valued especially in Rus-
sia, where it was once an indispensable
part of the uniform of the army officer.
The sea otters wander in pairs, or some-
times in herds of from twenty to thirty,
spending most of their time in the sea.
They are shy and swift, and when their
haunts on land are once disturbed they
rarely return to them. Any foreign odor
 as the smell of man, or of fire, or of
smoke  is very distasteful to them. Of
late years the sea otters have seldom
come on shore anywhere, as the whole
coast of Alaska has been made offensive
to them. Tile single young is born in the
kelp, and the mother carries it around in
her arms like a babe.
	In tile old days the Indians killed the
otters with spears. When one was dis-
covered in the open sea, the canoes closed
upon it, and the hunters made wild noises
and incantations. To the Indian who
actually killed it the prize was awarded;

various settlements in the Aleutian Islands,
from Akutan to Attn, are temporarily em-
ployed there. It has been found necessary to
build vessels destined for the Yukon River at
some port in Bering Sea, as none of those con-
structed to the southward have survived the
rough seas of the North Pacific. But this ship-
building industry must be of very short dura-
tion.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00587" SEQ="0587" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="581">	Colonial Lessons of Alaska.	581

the others, who assisted in rounding
up the animal, getting nothing. In
case of several wounds, the hunter whose
spear was nearest the snout was regarded
as the killer. This was a device of the
priests to lead the Indians to strike for
the head, so as not to tear the skin of the
body.
	Originally, the sea otter hunt was per-
mitted to natives only. By their methods
there were never enough taken seriously
to check the increase of the species. The
Aleut who had obtained one skin was
generally satisfied for the year. If he
found none after a short hunt, the sick
tum-tum or squaw-heart would lead
him to give up the chase.
	Next appeared the squaw-man as
a factor in the sea otter chase. The
squaw-man is a white man who marries
into a tribe to secure the natives pri-
vileges. These squaw-men were more
persistent hunters than the natives, and
they brought about the general use of
rifles instead of spears. A larger quan-
tity of skins was taken under these con-
ditions, but the numbers of sea otters
were not appreciably reduced.
	The success of squaw-men in this and
other enterprises aroused the envy of
white men less favorably placed. A
law was passed by Congress depriving
native tribes of all privileges not shared
by white men. This opened the sea
otter hunt to all men, and thus forced the
commercial companies, against their will,
to enter on a general campaign of de-
struction.
	Schooners were now equipped for the
sea otter hunt, each one carrying about
twenty Indian canoes, either skin ca-
noes or wooden dugouts, with the pro-
per crew. Arrived at the Aleutian sea
otter grounds, a schooner would scatter
the canoes so as to cover about sixty
square miles of sea. It would then come
to anchor, and its canoes would patrol
the water, thus securing every sea otter
within the distance covered. Then a
station further on would be taken and
the work continued. In this way, in 1895,
1896, and 1897, every foot of probable
sea otter ground was examined. At the
end of the season of 1897 only a few
hundred sea otters were left, most of
them about the Sannak Islands, while a
small number of wanderers were scat-
tered along remote coasts. Of these, two
were taken off Afto Nuevo Island, Cali-
fornia, and two were seen at Point Sur.
One, caught alive on land, was allowed
to escape, its captor not knowing its
value. One was taken in 1896 on St.
Paul Island, in the Pribilof, and one in
1897 on St. George.
	The statistics of the sea otter catch
have been carefully compiled by Cap-
tain Calvin N. looper, commander of
the Bering Sea Patrol Fleet, a man to
whom the people of Alaska owe a last-
ing debt of gratitude. These show that
in the earliest years of American occupa-
tion upwards of 2500 skins were taken
annually by canoes going out from the
shore, and this without apparent diminu-
tion of the herd. Later, with the use
of schooners, this number was increased,
reaching a maximum of 4152 in 1885.
Although the number of schooners con-
tinued to increase, the total catch fell off
in 1896 to 724, these being divided among
more than 40 schooners, with nearly 800
canoes. Very many of the hunters thus
obtained no skins at all.
	At the earnest solicitation of Captain
looper, this wanton waste was finally
checked in 1898. By an order of the
Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Gage, all
sea otter hunting, whether by white men
or by natives, was limited to the original
Iimdian methods. In this chase, no one
is now allowed the use of any boat or
vessel other than the ordinary two hatch
skin-covered bidarka or the open Yakut-
at canoe.
	This simple regulation will prevent
any further waste. Had it been adopt-
ed two years ago, it would have saved
$500,000 a year to the resources of
Alaska, besides perhaps the lives of a</PB>

thousand people, who must now starve
unless fed by the government,  a tardy
paternalism which is the first step toward
extermination. The loss of self-depend-
ence and of self-respect which govern-
ment support entails is as surely destruc-
tive to the race as starvation itself.
	Our courts have decided that the
Aleuts are Americau citizens, their
former nominal status under Russian
law being retained after annexation by
the United States. But citizenship can
avail nothing unless their means of sup-
port is guarded by the government.
They have no power to protect them-
selves. They can have no representa-
tives in Congress. A delegate from
Alaska, even if such an official existed,
would represent interests wholly differ-
ent from theirs. They cannot repel en-
croachments by force of arms, nor in-
deed have they any clear idea of the
causes of their misery, for they have
cheerfully taken part in their own un-
doing. In such case, the only good gov-
ernment possible is an enlightened pa-
ternalism. This will be expensive, for
otherwise it will be merely farcical. If
we are not prepared to give such gov-
ernment to our dependencies, we should
cede them to some power that is ready
to meet the demands. Nothing can be
more demoralizing than the forms of de-
mocracy, when actual self-government is
impossible.
	In general, the waste and confusion
in Alaska arise from four sources, 
lack of centralization of power and au-
thority, lack of scientific knowledge,
lack of personal and public interest, and
the use of offices as political patronage.
	In the first place, no single person or
bureau is responsible for Alaska. The
Treasury Department looks after the
charting and the patrol of its coasts, the
care of its animal life, the prohibition of
intoxicating liquors, and the control of the
fishing industries. The investigation of
its fisheries and marine animals is the duty
of the United States Fish Commission.
The army has certain ill-defined duties,
which have been worked out mainly in a
futile and needless relief expedition, with
an opera bouffe accompaniment of de-
horned reindeer. The legal proceedings
within the territory are governed by the
statutes of Oregon, unless otherwise or-
dered. The Department of Justice has
a few representatives scattered over the
vast territory, whose duty it is to enforce
these statutes, chiefly through the farce
of jury trials. The land in general is
under control of the Department of the
Interior. The Bureau of Education has
an agent in charge of certain schools,
while the President of the United States
finds his representative in his appointee,
the governor of the territory. The of-
fice of governor carries large duties and
small powers. There are many interests
under the governors supervision, but he
can do little more than to serve as a
means of communication between some
of them and Washington. It is to be
remembered that Alaska is a great do-
main in itself, and, considering means
of transportation, Sitka, the capital, is
much further from Attu or Point Bar-
row than it is from Washington.
	The virtual ruler of Alaska is the
Secretary of the Treasury. But in his
hands, however excellent his intentions,
good government is in large degree un-
attainable for lack of power. Important
matters must await the decision of Con-
gress. The wisest plans fail for want of
force to carry them out. The right man
to go on difficult errands is not at hand,
or, if he is, there is no means to send
him. In the division of labor which is
necessary in great departments of gov-
ernuient, the affairs of Alaska, with
those of the customs service elsewhere,
are assigned to one of the assistant sec-
retaries. Of his duties Alaskan affairs
form but a very small part, and this
part is often assigned to one of the sub-
ordinate clerks. One of the assistant
secretaries, Mr. Charles Sumner Ham-
lin, visited Alaska in 1894, in order to</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00589" SEQ="0589" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="583">	Colonial Lessons of Alaska.	583

secure a clear idea of his duties. This
visit was a matter of great moment to
the territory, for the knowledge thus ob-
tained brought wisdom out of confusion,
and gave promise of better management
in the future.
	To this division of responsibility and
confusion of authority, with the conse-
quent paralysis of effort, must be added
the lack of trustworthy information at
Washington. Some most admirable sci-
entific work has been done in Alaska
under the auspices of the national gov-
ernment, notably by the United States
Coast Survey, the United States Fish
Commission, and the United States Re-
venue Service. But for years a profes-
sional lobbyist has posed as the chief au-
thority in Alaskan affairs. Other wit-
nesses have been intent on personal or
corporation interests, while still another
class has drawn the longbow on general
principles. Such testimony has tended
to confuse the minds of officials, who
have come to regard Alaska chiefly as a
departmental bugbear.
	Important as the fur seal question has
become, its subject matter received no
adequate scientific investigation until
1896 and 1897. Vast as are the salm-
on interests, such investigation on lines
broad enough to yield useful results is
yet to be made. The sole good work on
the sea otter is that of a revenue officer
whose time was fully occupied by affairs
of a very different kind.
	Thus it has come to pass that Alaskan
interests have suffered alike from official
credulity and official skepticism. Mat-
ters of real importance have been shelved,
in the fear that in some way or other the
great commercial companies would profit
by them. At other times the word of
these same corporations has been law,
when the department might well have
asserted its independence. The interest
of these corporations is in general that
of the government, because they cannot
wish to destroy the basis of their own
prosperity. To protect them in their
rights is to prevent their encroachments.
These facts have been often obscured by
the attacks of lobbyists and blackmailers.
On the other hand, in minor matters the
interests of the government and the com-
panies may be in opposition, and this fact
has been often obscured by prejudiced
testimony.
	Another source of difficulty is the
lack of interest in distant affairs which
have no relation to personal or partisan
politics. The most vital legislation in
regard to Alaska may fail of passage,
because no Congressman concerns him-
self in it. Alaska has no vote in any
convention or election, no delegate to
be placated, and can give no assistance
in legislative log-rolling. In a large
degree, our legislation at Washington is
a scramble for the division of public
funds among the different congressional
districts. In this Alaska has no part.
She is not a district filled with eager
constituents who clamor for new post-
offices, custom-offices, or improved chan-
nels and harbors. She is only a colony,
or rather a chain of little colonies; and
a colony, to Americans as to Spaniards,
has been in this case merely a means of
revenue, a region to be exploited.
	Finally, the demands of the spoils~
system have often sent unfit men to
Alaska. The duties of these officials
are delicate and difficult, requiring spe-
cial knowledge as well as physical en-
durance. Considerable experience in
the north, also, is necessary for success.
When positions of this kind are given as
rewards for partisan service, the men re-
ceiving them feel themselves underpaid.
The political war-horse, who has
borne the brunt of the fray in some
great convention, feels himself shelved
if sent to the north to hunt for salmon-
traps, or to look after the interests of
half-civilized people, most of whom can-
not speak a word of English. A few
of these men have been utterly unworthy,
intemperate and immoral; and occasion-
ally one, in his stay in Alaska, earns</PB>

that perfect right to be hung which
John Brown assigned to the border
ruffian. On the other hand, a goodly
number of these political appointees, in
American fashion, have made the best
of circumstances, and by dint of native
sense and energy have made good their
lack of special training. The extension
of the classified civil service has raised
the grade of these as of other govern-
mental appointments. The principles of
civil service reform are in the highest
degree vital in the management of colo-
nies.
	As an illustration of official ineffec-
tiveness in Alaska, I may take the con-
trol of the salmon rivers by means of a
body of inspectors. In a joint letter
to the Assistant Secretary of the Trea-
sury, in 1897, Captain looper and I
used the following language: 
At present this work is virtually in-
effective for the following reasons: The
appointees in general have been men
who know little or nothing of the pro-
blems involved, which demand expert
knowledge of salmon, their kinds and
habits, the methods of fishing, and the
conditions and peculiarities of Alaska.
Foi~ effective work, special knowledge is
requisite, as well as general intelligence
and integrity. These men are largely
dependent upon the courtesy of the
packing companies for their knowledge
of the salmon, for their knowledge of
fishing methods, for all transportation
and sustenance (except in southeastern
Alaska), and for all assistance in en-
forcing the law. The inspectors cannot
go from place to place at need, and so
spend much of their time in enforced in-
action. They have no authority to re-
move obstructions or to enforce the law
in case of its violation. For this rea-
son, their recommendations largely pass
unheeded.
	To remedy these conditions, provi-
sion should be made for the appointment
only of men of scientific or practical
training, thoroughly familiar with fishes
or fishery methods, or both, and capable
of finding out the truth in any matter
requiring investigation. For such pur-
poses, expert service is as necessary as it
would be in bank inspection or in any
similar specialized work. The depart-
ment should provide suitable transpor-
tation facilities for its inspectors. It
should be possible for them to visit at
will any of the canneries or salmon
rivers under their charge. They should
be provided with means to pay for ex-
penses of travel and sustenance, and
should receive no financial courtesies
from the packing companies, or be de-
pendent upon them for assistance in
carrying on their work. The inspectors
should be instructed to remove and de-
stroy all obstructions found in the riv-
ers in violation of law. They should
have large powers of action and discre-
tion, and they should have at hand such
means as is necessary to carry out their
purposes.~~
	Umider present conditions, the newly
appointed inspector, knowing nothing of
Alaska, and still less of the salmon in-
dustry, is landed at some cannery by a
revenue cutter. He becomes the guest
of the superintendent of the cannery,
who treats him with politeness, and
meets his ignorance with ready informa-
tion. All his movements are depend-
ent upon the courtesy of the canners.
He has no boat of his own, no force of
assistants, no power to do anything. He
cannot walk from place to place in the
tall, wet rye-grass, and he cannot even
cross the river without a borrowed boat.
All his knowledge of the business comes
from the superintendent. If he dis-
covers infraction of law, it is because he
is allowed to do so, and he receives a
valid excuse for it. It is only by the
consent of the law - breaker that the
infraction can be punished. The law-
breaker is usually courteous enough in
this regard; for his own interests would
be subserved by the general enforcement
of reasonable laws. The most frequent</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00591" SEQ="0591" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="585">	Colonial Lessons of Alaska.	585

violation of law is the building of a dam
across the salmon river just above the
neutral tide water where the fish gather
as if to play, before ascending the stream
to spawn. Such a darn, if permanent,
prevents any fish from running, and thus
shuts off all future increase. Meanwhile,
by means of nets, all the waiting fish can
be captured. This is forbidden by law,
which restricts the use of nets to the sea
beaches. Yet dams exist to-day in al-
most every salmon river in Alaska; even
in those of that most rigidly law-abiding
of communities, New Metlakalitla, on
Annette Island. The lawlessness of the
few forces lawlessness on all.
	All that the inspector can do in the
name of the government is to order the
destruction of an unlawful dam. He
has no power to destroy it; and if he
had, he must borrow a boat from the
company and do it himself. Then, in
the evening, as he sits at the dinner ta-
ble, the guest of the offending superin-
tendent, he can tell the tale of his ex-
ploits.
	The general relation of the salmon
interests to law deserves a moments
notice. Most of the streams of south-
~rn and southwestern Alaska are short
and broad, coming down from moun-
tain lakes, swollen in summer by melt-
ing snows. The common red salmon,
which is the most abundant of the five
species of Alaska, runs up the streams
in thousands to spawn in the lakes in
July and August. One of these rivers,
the Karluk, on the island of Kadiak,
is perhaps the finest salmon stream in
the world, having been formerly almost
solidly full of salmon in the breeding
season. The conditions on Karluk
River may serve as fairly typical. A
few salmon are smoked or salted, but
most of them are put up in one pound
tins or cans, as usually seen in commerce.
This work of preservation is carried on
in large establishments called canneries.
One of these factories was early built at
Karluk, on a sand-spit at the mouth of
the river. All Alaska is government
land. The cannery companies are
therefore squatters, practically without
claim, without rights, and without re-
sponsibilities. The seining-ground on
this sand-spit of Karluk is doubtless the
best fishing-ground in Alaska. The law
provided that no fish should be taken on
Saturday, that no dams or traps should
be used, that no nets should be placed
in the river, and no net set within one
hundred feet of a net already placed.
This last clause is the sole hold that any
cannery has on the fishing-ground where
it is situated. Soon other factories were
opened on the beach at Karluk by other
persons, and each newcomer claimed the
right to use the seine along the spit.
This made it necessary for the first
company to run seines day and night,
in order to hold the ground, keeping
up the work constantly, whether the
fish could be used or not. At times
many fish so taken have been wasted;
at other times the surplus has been
shipped across to the cannery of Chig-
nik, on the mainland. Should the nets
be withdrawn for an hour, some rival
would secure the fishing-ground, and
the first company would be driven off,
because they must not approach with-
in a hundred feet of the outermost net.
With over-fishery of this sort the pro-
duct of Karluk River fell away rapidly.
Some understanding was necessary. The
stronger companies formed a trust, and
bought out or froze out the lesser
ones, and the canneries at Karluk fell
into the hands of a single association.
All but two of them were closed, that the
others might have full work. Under pre-
sent conditions, Alaska has more than
twice as many canneries as can be oper-
ated. Some of these were perhaps built
only to be sold to competitors, but others
have entailed losses both on their owners
and on their rivals.
	Meanwhile, salmon became scarce in
other rivers, and canners at a distance
began to cast greedy eyes on Karluk.</PB>

In 1897 a steamer belonging to another
great trust invaded Karluk, claiming
equal legal right in its fisheries. This
claim was resisted by the people in pos-
session,  legally by covering the beach
with nets, illegally by threats and in-
terference. More than once the heights
above Karluk have been fortified; for to
the north of Fifty-Three injunctions
are laid with the rifle. On the other
hand, Scar-Faced Charley of Prince
Williams Sound and his reckless asso-
ciates stood ready to do battle for their
company. In one of the disputes, a small
steamer sailed over a net, cast anchor
within it, then steamed ahead, dragged
the anchor, and tore the net to pieces. In
another case, a large steamer anchored
within the fishing-grounds. The rival
company cast a net around her, and
would have wrecked her on the beach.
The claim for damages to the propeller
from the nets brought this case into the
United States courts. Fear of scandal,
and consequent injury to the companys
interests in the East, is doubtless the
chief reason why these collisions do not
lead to open warfare. The difficulty in
general is not due to the lawlessness of
the companies, nor to any desire to de-
stroy the industry by which they live.
Our government makes it impossible for
them to be law-abiding. It grants them
no rights and no protection, and exacts
of them no duties. In short, it exercises
toward them in adequate degree none
of the normal functions of government.
What should be done is plain enough.
The rivers are government property, and
should be leased on equitable terms to
the canning companies, who should be
held to these terms and at the same time
protected in their rights. But Congress,
which cannot attend to two things at once,
is too busy with other affairs to pay at-
tention to this. The utter ruin of the
salmon industry in Alaska is therefore
a matter of a short time. Fortunately,
however, unlike the sea otter, the salmon
cannot be exterminated, and a few years
of salmon-hatching, or even of mere neg-
lect, will bring it up again.
	Of the marine interests of Alaska, the
catch of the fur seal is by far the most
important, and its details are best known
to the public. Whenever the fur seal
question promises to lead to internation-
al dispute, the public pricks up its ears;
but this interest dies away when the
blood ceases to boil against England.
The history of this industry is more
creditable to the United States than that
of the sea otter and the salmon, but it is
not one to be proud of. When the Pri-
bilof Islands came into our possession,
in 1867, we found the fur seal industry
already admirably managed. A com-
pany had leased the right to kill a cer-
tain number of superfluous males every
year, under conditions which thoroughly
protected the herd. This arrangement
was continued by us, and is still in opera-
tion. If not the best conceivable dispo-
sition of the herd, it was the best possible
at the time; and to do the best possible
is all that good government demands.
	We were, however, criminally slow
in taking possession of the islands after
their purchase from .Russia. In 1868,
about 250,000 skins of young males
(worth perhaps $2,000,000), the proper-
ty of the government, were openly stolen
by enterprising poachers from San Fran-
cisco. As only superfluous males were
taken, this onslaught caused no injury
to the herd. It was simply the con-
version to private uses of so much
public property, or just plain stealing.
After 1868 the Pribilof Islands yielded
a regular annual quota of 100,000 skins
for twenty years, when pelagic seal-
ing, or the killing of females at sea,
was begun, and rapidly cut down the
herd. This suicidal industry origi-
nated in the United States; but adverse
public opinion and adverse statutes final-
ly drove it from our ports, and it was
centred at Victoria, where, as this is
written, it awaits its coup de grdce from
the Quebec commission of 1898.</PB>

	During the continuance of this mon-
strous business, the breeding herd of
the Pribilof Islands was reduced from
about 650,000 females (in 186884)
to 130,000 (in 1897). It is not fair
to charge the partial extinction of this
most important of fur-bearing animals
to our bad government of Alaska, in-
asmuch as it was accomplished by for-
eign hands against our constant protest.
Yet in a large sense this was our own
fault, for the lack of exact and unques-
tioned knowledge has been our most not-
able weakness in dealing with Great
Britain in this matter. The failure to
establish as facts the ordinary details of
the life of the fur seal caused the loss
of our case before the Paris Tribunal of
Arbitration. Guesswork, however well
intended, was met by the British with
impudent assertion. British diplomacy
is disdainful of mere opinion, though it
has a certain respect for proved fact.
Moreover, it was only after a long strug-
gle that our own people were prevented
(in 1898) from doing the very things
which were the basis of our just com-
plaint against Great Britain.
	The other interests of Alaska I need
not discuss here in detail. The recent
discovery of vast gold fields in this re-
gion has brought new problems, which
Congress has made little effort to meet.
If we may trust the newspapers, our
colonial postal system is absurdly inad-
equate, and the administration of justice
remains local or casual. The Klondike
adventurers make their own law as they
go along, with little responsibility to the
central government. Lynch law may
be fairly good law in a region whence
criminals can escape only to starve or to
freeze; but martial law is better, and the
best available when the methods of the
common law are out of the question.
The real criminals of Alaska have
been the wild-cat~ transportation com-
Monstrous in an economic sense, because
grossly and needlessly wasteful; monstrous in
a moral sense, because grossly and needlessly
panies which sprang up like mushrooms
with the rush for the Klondike. There
are three or four well-established com-
panies running steamers to Alaska, well-
built, well-manned, and destined to ports
which really exist. But besides the le-
gitimate business there has been a great
amount of wicked fraud. A very large
percentage of the Klondike adventurers
know nothing of mining, nothi~ng of Alas-.
ka, little of the sea, and little of hard-
ship. These people have been gathered
from all parts of the country, and sent
through foggy, rock-bound channels and
ferocious seas, in vessels unseaworthy
and with incompetent pilots, their desti-
nation often the foot of some impossible
trail leading only to death. I notice in
one circular that a graded railroad bed
is shown on the map, through the tre-
mendous ice-filled gorges of Copper Riv-
er, a wild stream of the mountains, in
which few have found gold, and from
whose awful glaciers few have returned
alive. In the height of the Klondike
season of 1898, scarcely a day passed
without a shipwreck somewhere along
the coast,  some vessel foundering on
a rock of the Alaskan Archipelago or
swamped in the open sea. Doubtless
most of the sufferers in these calamities
had no business in Alaska. Doubtless
they should have known better thami to
risk life and equipment in ships and
with men so grossly unfit. But the
public in civilized lands is accustomed
to trust something to government inspec-
tion. The common man has not learned
how ships may be sent out to be wrecked
for the insurance. In established com-
munities good government would have
checked this whole experience of fraud;
but in this case no one seemed to have
power or responsibility, and the affair
was allowed to run its own course. The
wild-cat~ lines have now mostly failed,
for the extent of the Klondike traffic is

cruel; withal perfectly legal, because not yet
condemned by any international agreement in
which Great Britain has taken part.</PB>

far less than was expected, and the
Alaska promoter plies his trade of ob-
taining money under false pretenses in
some other quarter.
	The control of the childlike native
tribes of Alaska offers many anomalies.
As citizens of the United States, living
in American territory, they are entitled
to the protection of its laws; yet in most
tarts of Alaska the natives rarely see an
officer of the United States, and know
nothing of our courts or procedures. In
most villages the people choose their own
chief, who has vaguely defined but not
extensive authority. A Greek priest is
furnished to them by the Established
Church of Russia. He is possessed of
power in spiritual matters, and such
temporal authority as his own character
and the turn of events may give him.
The post trader, representing the Alaska
Commercial Company, often a squaw-
man of some superior intelligence, has
also large powers of personal influence,
which are in general wisely used. The
fact that the natives are nearly always
in debt to the company 1 tends to accen-
tuate the companys authority. The con-
trol of the Greek priest varies with the
character of the man. Some of the priests
are devoted Christians, whose sole pur-
pose is the good of the flock. To oth-
ers, the flock exists merely to be shorn
for the benefit of the Church or the
priest. But there are a few whom to
call brutes, if we may believe common
report, would be a needless slur on the
bear and the sea lion.
	On the Pribilof Islands, an anomalous
joint paternalism under the direction of
the United States government and the
lessee companies has existed since 1868.

	1 The credit system has been almost wholly
abandoned recently, as the future of the sea ot-
ter leaves no hope of payment of debts.
	2 For example, some ten or twelve years ago
N. K. was fined fifty dollars by the government
agent in charge of the Pribilof Islands, for
distnrbance of the peace. His fault was a
too vehement remonstrance against the viola-
tion of his young wife by American scoundrels
The lessees furnish houses, coal, physician,
and teacher,besides caring for the widows
and orphans. The government agent
has oversight and control of all opera-
tions on the islands, and is the official
superior of the natives, having full pow-
er in all matters of government. This
arrangement is not ideal, and is in part
a result of early accident. It has worked
fairly in practice, however, and the na-
tives of these islands are relatively pro-
sperous and intelligent. The chief dan-
ger has been in the direction of pamper-
ing. With insurance against all accidents
of life, there is little incentive to thrift.
Outside of the seal-killing season (June
and July) the people become insuffer-
ably lazy. There are records of occasion-
al abuses of power in the past,2  abuses
of a kind to be prevented only by the
sending of men of honor as agents. In
general, self - interest leads the commer-
cial companies to send only sober and
decent men to look after their affairs;
and the government cannot afford to do
less, even for Alaska. Of this the ap-
pointing power at Washington seems to
have a growing appreciation.
	Among the irregular methods of gov-
ernment in Alaska we must mention one
of the most remarkable experiments in
the civilization of wild tribes yet at-
tempted anywhere in the world. I re-
fer to the work of William Duncan, the
pastor and director of a colony of Sim-
sian Indians at New Metlakahtla. I
can only mention Duncans work in pass-
ing, but his methods and results deserve
careful study,  far more than they have
yet received. The single will of this
strong man has, in thirty years, convert-
ed a band of cannibals into a sober, law-

temporarily employed on the island. The case
was a most flagrant one, but the weak-minded
agent felt unable to cope with it. With the
plea that boys will be boys he excused the
culprits, visiting the punishment on the in-
jured husband. The ill feeling resulting from
this action is still a source of embarrassment
on St. Paul Island.</PB>

abiding, industrious community, living in
good houses, conducting a large salmon
cannery, navigating a steamer built by
their own hands, and in general proving
competent to take care of themselves in
civilized life.
	One of the least fortunate acts of the
United States Congress in regard to
Alaska has been the enactment of a most
rigid prohibitory law as to alcoholic li-
quors. This is an iron-clad statute for-
bidding the importation, sale, or manu-
facture of intoxicants of any sort in
Alaska. The primary reason for this
act is the desire to protect the Indians,
Aleuts, and Eskimos from a vice to
which they are excessively prone, and
which soon ruins them. But a virtu-
ous statute may be the worst kind of
law, as was noted long ago by Confu-
cius. ~ statute has not checked the
flow of liquor in Alaska, while it has
done more than any other influence to
subvert the respect for law. Usually,
men who are not in Alaska for their
health are hard drinkers, and liquor
they will have. It is shipped to Alaska
as Florida water, Jamaica ginger,
bay rum. Demijohns are placed in
flour barrels, in sugar barrels, in any
package which will contain them.1 With
all this there is a vast amount of out-
right sniuggling, which the Treasury De-
partment tries in vain to check. All
southeastern Alaska is one vast harbor,
with thousands of densely wooded islands,
mostly uninhabited. Cargoes of liquors
citn be safely hidden almost anywhere,
	It is said that when the Umatilla foundered
off Port Townsend, August, 1896, those who
took away her cargo found in each of the sugar
barrels consigned to Alaska only a demijohn
of whiskey, the sea having dissolved the sugar.
	2 The appeal of this case (Eudleman et al. vs.
the United States) has proved a matter of the
greatest importance in relation to the govern-
ment of American colonies. It was contended
(according to the New York Evening Post)
that the law on which the prosecution was
based was unconstitutional, because the gov-
ernment of the United States can exercise only
those specific powers conferred unon it by the
to be removed piece by piece in small
boats. Many such cargoes have been
seized and destroyed; but the risk of
capture merely serves to raise the price
of liquor. Once on shore the liquor is
safe enough. Upwards of seventy sa-
loons are running openly in Juneau, and
perhaps forty in Sitka. There are dives
and groggeries wherever a demand ex-
ists. Most of the tippling - houses are
the lowest of their kind, because, as they
are outlaws to begin with, the ordinary
restraints of law and order have no ef-
fect on them.
	In 1878, it is said, a schooner loaded
with Florida water  came to the island
of St. Lawrence, in Bering Sea, and the
people exchanged all their valuables for
drink. The result was that in the win-
ter fo]lowing the great majority died
of drunkenness and starvation, and in
certain villages not a person was left.
Sometimes the stock in trade of whis-
key smugglers is seized by the Treasury
officials. But high prices serve as a
sort of insurance against capture, and
there are ways of securing a tip in ad-
vance when raids are likely to occur.
This traffic demoralizes all in any way
connected with it. But one conviction
for illegal sale of liquors has ever been
obtained in Alaska, so far as I know; and
it was understood that this was a test
case for the purpose of determining the
constitutionality of the law.2 A jury trial
in any case means an acquittal, for every
jury is made up of law-breakers, or of
men in sympathy with the law-breaking.

Constitution; that the Constitution guarantees
to the citizen the right to own, hold, and ac-
quire property, and makes no distinction as to
the character of the property that intoxicat-
ing liquors are property, and are subject to ex-
change, barter, and traffic, like any other com-
modity in which a right of property exists;
that inasmuch as the power to regulate com-
merce was committed to Congress to relieve it
from all restrictions, Congress cannot itself im-
pose restrictions upon commerce by prohibiting
the sale of a particular commodity; and that
if Congress has the power to regulate the sale
of intoxicating liquors within the territories</PB>

This fact vitiates all other criminal pro-
cedure in Alaska. It should secure the
entire abblition of jury trials and other
forms of procedure adapted only to a
compact civilization.1
	Whatever laws are made for the con-
trol of the liquor traffic in Alaska
should be capable of enforcement. They
should be supported, if need be, with the
full force of the United States. To im-
pose upon a colony laws with which the
people have no sympathy, and then to
leave these people to punish infraction
for themselves, is to invite anarchy and
to turn all law into a farce.
	Whiskey is the greatest curse of the
people of Alaska,  American, Russian,
and native. I have not a word to say
in favor of its use, yet I am convinced
that unrestricted traffic, that any condi-
tion of things, would be better than the
present law, with its failure in enforce-
ment. The total absence of any law
would not make matters much worse than
they are. In fact, law would hardly be
missed. In any case, Alaska gets along
fairly well,  much better than any trop-
ical region would under like conditions.

as a police regulation, it can only enact laws
applicable to all the territories alike.
	Judge W. W. Morrow, of the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for California, de-
claring the decision of the court upon these
claims, said: 
The answer to these and other like objec-
tions urged in the brief of counsel for the de-
fendant is found in the now well-established
doctrine that the territories of the United
States are entirely subject to the legislative au-
thority of Congress. They are not organized
under the Constitution, nor subject to its com-
plex distribution of the powers of government
as the organic law, but are the creation exclu-
sively of the legislative department, and sub-
ject to its supervision and control. The United
States, having rightfully acquired the territo-
ries, and being tbe only government which can
impose laws upon them, have the entire do-
main and sovereignty, national and municipal,
federal and state. Under this full nnd com-
prehensive authority, Congress has unquestion-
ably the power to exclude intoxicating liquors
from any or all of its territories, or limit their
sale under such regulations as it may prescribe.
Cold disinfects in more ways than one,
and Alaska gets the benefit of it.
	We cannot throw blame on the offi-
cials at Washington. They do the best
they can under the circumstances. The
dishonest men at the capital are not
many, and most of them the people elect
to send there. The minor officials in
general are conscientious and painstak-
ing, making the best possible of condi-
tions not of their choosing. The primary
difficulty is neglect. We try to throw
the burden of self-government on people
so situated that self-government is im-
possible. We impose on them statutes
unfitted to their conditions, and then
leave to them the enforcement. Above
all, what is everybodys business is no-
bodys, and what happens in Alaska is
generally nobodys business. INo con-
centration of power, no adequate legis-
lation, no sufficient appropriation,  on
these forms of neglect our failure chiefly
rests.
	If we have colonies, even one colony,
there must be some sort of a colonial
bureau, some concentrated power which
shall have exact knowledge of its people,

It may legislate in accordance with the special
needs of each locality, and vary its regulations
to meet the circumstances of the people. Whe-
ther the subject elsewhere would be a matter
of local police regulations or within the state
control nuder some other power, it is immate-
rial to consider; in a territory, all the func-
tions of government are within the legislative
jurisdiction of Congress, and may be exercised
through a local government or directly by such
legislation as we have now nuder considera-
tion.
	In other words, the colonies are under the
absolute control of Congress, subject to no re-
strictions of any sort, and free from the oper-
ation of any form of constitutional checks and
balances. Only through such freedom is colo-
nial government un~ler the United States pos-
sible.
	1 These facts were stated in detail a few years
ago by a special agent of the United States
Treasury. As a result, this truthful witness
was indicted by the grand jury at Sitka for
slander.  a futile act, but one which was the
source of much annoyance.</PB>

its needs, and its resources. The peo-
ple must be protected, their needs met,
and their resources husbanded. This
fact is well understood by the authorities
of Canada. While practically no gov-
ernment exists in the gold fields of Alas-
ka, Canada has chosen for the Klondike
within her borders a competent man,
thoroughly familiar with the region and
its needs, and has granted him full
power of action. The dispatches say
that Governor Ogilvie has entire charge
through his appointees of the depart-
ments of timber, land, justice, royalties,
and finances. The federal govern-
ment believes that one thoroughly re-
liable, tried, and trusted representative
of British laws and justice, and of Do-
minion federal power, can better guide
the destinies of this new country than a
number of petty untried officials with
limited powers, and Ogilvie thinks so
himself. 1
	Under the present conditions, when
the sea otters are destroyed, the fur seal
herd exterminated, the native tribes
starved to death, the salmon rivers de-
populated, the timber cut, and the pla-
cer gold fields worked out, Alaska is to
be thrown away like a sucked orange.
There is no other possible end, if we con-
tinue as we have begun. We are not
in Alaska for our health, and when we
can no longer exploit it we may as well
abandon it.
	But it may be argued that it will be
a very costly thing to foster all Alaskas
widely separated resources, and to give
good government to every one of her
scattered villages and posts. Further-
more, all this outlay is repaid only by
the enrichment of private corporations,2
which, with the exception of the fur seal

	Sau Francisco Chronicle, August 15, 1898.
2 The interests of Alaska, outside of mining,
are now largely in the hands of four great com-
panies,  the Alaska Commercial Company,
lessees, pay no tribute to the govern-
ment.
	Doubtless this is true. Government
is a costly thing, and its benefits are un-
equally distributed. But the cost would
be less if we should treat other resources
as we have treated the fur seal. To
lease the salmon rivers and to protect
the lessees in their rights would be to
insure a steady and large income to the
government, with greater profit to the
salmon canneries than comes with the
present confusion and industrial war.
	But admitting all this, we should
count the cost before accepting colo-
nies. It is too late to do so when
they once have been annexed. If we
cannot afford to watch them, to care
for them, to give them paternal rule
when no other is possible, we do wrong
to hoist our flag over them. Govern-
ment by the people is the ideal to be
reached in all our possessions, but there
are races of men now living under our
flag as yet incapable of receiving the
town meeting idea. A race of children
must be treated as children, a race of
brigands as brigands, and whatever au-
thority controls either must have behind
it the force of arms.
	Alaska has made individuals rich,
though the government has yet to get its
money back. But whether colonies pay
or not, it is essential to the integrity of
the United States itself that our control
over them should not be a source of cor-
ruption and waste. It may be that the
final loss of her colonies, mismanaged for
two centuries, will mark the civil and
moral awakening of Spain. Let us hope
that the same event will not mark a civil
and moral lapse in the nation which re-
ceives Spains bankrupt assets.

successfully carried out. To discard the
teachings of the past is even more dan-
gerous than to imitate them slavishly; to
set up for ourselves in the difficult busi-
ness of life, as if we were the flrst-comers
in the field and could frame the laws of
trade to suit our convenience, would be to
invite a failure which would be not only
complete, but ridiculous. The race is
greater than any community or individ-
ual, and it is the part of wisdom to take it
into partnership in all our undertakings.
We moderns have our own duties, re-
sponsibilities, rights, and work; we have
fresh fields to conquer and new tools to
work with. But the ancients were our
forbears; we are blood of their blood,
and bone of their bone. They survive
in us in instinct, temperament, and char-
acter; we have entered into the fruit of
their labors; they did a large part of
the work of life for us in the slow and
painful making of that invisible home
for the race which we call civilization.
We may break with the traditions of the
past, but we cannot escape from its vital
influence; we may discard the teachings
of our fathers,, but we can never get away
from them until we can get away from
ourselves. The hope of the world is in
this unbroken continuity of human expe-
rience and effort.
	Men in great masses act from instinct
rather than from intelligence; and the
early colonists on this continent, how-
ever radical in religious or political con-
viction, kept in close touch with the spir-
itual life of the race, even while they
endeavored with passionate earnestness
to break with some of its traditions.
No section of the new country and no
group of settlers was long content with
the hewing of wood and the drawing of
water. There was work of the most ru-
dimentary kind to be done, and it was
done in many cases with consuming ener-
gy; but the Atlantic, which then present-
ed such serious obstacles to intercourse,
was not broad enough to sever the men in
the New World from the men in the Old.
	VOL. LXXXII.  NO. 493.	38
The hands of the early colonists were
set to pressing tasks; they were clearing
wild land, fighting wild men, building
homes and churches and blockhouses;
but their minds were dealing with the old
questions, and their spiritual fellowship
with the world behind them was never
broken. The schools, the universities,
the literature, philosophy, and science of
Europe had left their impress on many
of these pioneers, planters and builders;
and the tradition of. culture, the unbro-
ken spiritual life of the race, was not suf-
fered to fall into abeyance. The tools
of the mind were brought over with the
tools of the hand; there were small col-
lections of books in many well - to - do
homes in every colony. The Puritan
had his scholarly traditions; Emmanuel
College was one of the formative influ-
ences in the making of the new nation.
It would be interesting, if it were possi-
ble, to trace the rivulets of knowledge
which found their way from Cambridge
University to this virgin continent, and
contributed largely to its fertilization.
The continuity of the essential life of
men, behind all changes of condition
and environment, was never more strik-
ingly shown than in the reappearance in
new institutions, on new soil, in a re-
mote quarter of the globe, of the ideals
and spirit of schools imbedded in an-
cient tradition and already venerable
with years. There was a wide differ-
ence of external aspect between the
plain, unadorned buildings in which tJ~e
earliest American colleges began their
york, and those ivy - clad walls and
lovely gardens beside~ the Cam or on
the Isis; but there was no break in the
continuity of interest and work which
the ripe old university and the crude
young college were set to conserve and
accomplish. The time-honored course
of study, in its transference from the
Old to the New World, suffered no seri-
ous change. In the homes of the well-
to-do colonists, the great textbooks, which
many generations had already thumbed</PB>

and conned and learned by heart, were
read with the zest of men whose minds
were often forced to postpone their claims
until a more convenient season. The
older classics found places and times in
those homes. Theological works were
read with avidity, but the love of liter-
ature for its own sake never died out.
The seeds of the first important move-
ment in American literature were plant-
ed in those early days of hardship and
arduous toil.
	Harvard College had its modest be-
ginning in 1636, and Yale followed it
sixty-four years later; both institutions
not only fostering and aiding the strug-
gling intellectual life of the young com-
munities, but appearing because the time
was ripe in the needs and demands of
these communities. As soon as the col-
onies could gain time from the necessi-
ties of their physical work, they began
building for the spirit as ardently as
they had already built for the body.
	In New York the Dutch influence
was soon blended with the English in-
fluence, but, in spite of great\commercial
opportunities, it was not devoid of in-
tellectual quality. Kings College, which
has grown into Columbia University, and
become one of the most promising and
progressive of the higher schools of thq
country, was founded in 1754. Nassau
Hall, now expanded to the large dimen-
sions of Princeton University, dates back
to 1746. The University of Pennsyl-
vania was organized as a university in
1779. Virginia brought from the Old
World an intellectual tradition which
differed from that which was fostered
in New England chiefly in its indiffer-
ence to theological issues and its leaning
toward belleslettres. In those fine old
houses on the James, which registered
the high water mark of social develop-
ment in the New World, were to be
found small collections of the best liter-
ature in at least four languages. The
library of Mr. Byrd, of Westover, con-
tained six hundred and fifty volumes of
classics. The best class of Virginians
were bred, later, in the school of Addi-
son, Pope, Steele, and Johnson. They
were attracted by the elegance of style,
the urbanity of manner, the social qual-
ity, of the writers of the Queen Anne
period and their immediate successors.
The New Englander put the eniphasis
on the intellectual quality of literature,
its content of thought; the Virginian, on
its form, atmosphere, polish. The New
Englander, for instance, would have
cared for Lucretius; the Virginian, for
Horace. The New Englander would
have been drawn to Aristotle by the
closeness of his intellectual processes;
the Virginian would have drifted to
Plato under the attraction of the rich
and varied social life in the atmosphere
of which the Dialogues are steeped.
	Those who have grown up under the
influence of New England education
and of the New England writers have
failed, as a rule, to understand and ap-
preciate the culture which was shared
by the best people of Virginia, and the
depth and vital power of which are sug-
gested by the fact that of the five chief
makers of the nation four were Virgin-
ians. That culture found its expression
in statesmanship rather than in litera-
ture, and it is owing to the inadequate
and somewhat sectional idea of culture
which once prevailed that its quality
and extent were so long overlooked. In
any true history of the spiritual life of
the nation Virginia must always have
its place beside New England. The
two sections were not only the chief fac-
tors in the shaping of affairs in the colo-
nies, the direction of the Revolutionary
movement, and the organization of the
government; they were also original
sources of intellectual influences which
supplemented each other in a very un-
usual fashion. If the intellectual qual-
ity which Virginia gave to public life in
the early days of the government had
been sustained at the level which it
reached in Madison, Jefferson, and Mar-</PB>

shall, we should have furnished an exam-
ple of the highest intellect dealing with
public affairs which society has seen
since the days of Pericles.
	The University of Virginia was opened
for students in 1825. Kings and bish-
ops have often laid the foundations of
great schools, but that magnificent ser-
vice to humanity has rarely come in the
way of a statesman. It was Wolsey
the ecclesiastic, rather than Wolsey the
minister of state, who founded Christ
Church. Jefferson was as far as possi-
ble removed from the ecclesiastical tra-
dition. He was a man of affairs, with
a distinct philosophical bent of mind; a
politician by instinct and in method, a
statesman in temper and aim. For ab-
stract education he had small sympathy;
for culture as a mere refinement of the
processes of mind he had no respect.
His conception of education had a touch
of antique breadth and vitality; it was,
in his view, the occupation of the scholar
and the privilege of the gentleman, but
it was also the duty of the citizen. Its
fruits were not to be ripened in studious
seclusion; they were to be borne in the
tumult of public affairs. Culture was
to find expression in politics no less than
in literature and the arts. He defined
the purposes of the higher education in
this fashion 
(1.) To form the statesmen, legisla-
tors, and judges, on whom public pro-
sperity and individual happiness are so
much to depend. (2.) To expound the
principles and structures of government,
the laws which regulate the intercourse
of nations, those formed municipally for
our own government, and a sound spirit
of legislation, which, banishing all un-
necessary restraint on individual action,
shall leave us free to do whatever does
not violate the equal rights of another.
(3.) To harmonize and promote the in-
terests of agriculture, manufactures, and
commerce, and by well-informed views
of political economy to give a free scope
to the public industry. (4.) To develop
the reasoning faculties of our youth, en-
large their minds, cultivate their morals,
and instil into them the principles of
virtue and order. (5.) To enlighten
them with mathematical and physical
sciences, which advance the arts, and
,administer to the health, the subsistence,
and comforts of human life. (6.) And
generally, to form them to habits of re-
flection and correct action, rendering
them examples of virtue to others, and
of happiness within themselves.
	Here was an ideal of culture essen-
tially different from that which New
England shaped with such definiteness,
and, later, illustrated with such beauty,
and set forth with such persuasiveness, 
an ideal which took less account of spir-
itual relations, and concerned itself more
with the harmonizing of existing condi-
tions with high aims and ultimate prin-
ciples. These two ideals have so far
dominated our civilization; neither of
them has been realized, but both have
been immensely influential. It is im-
possible to say which has been the more
important; the higher interests of the
country would have suffered irreparably
if either had been lost. When a na-
tional ideal finally takes shape on this
continent, it will be born of the fusion
of these different ideals; which are, in
reality, attenipts to realize in conscious-
ness the relations of men to two great
aspects of experience.
	In the endeavor to give reality to Jef-
fersons ideal of education, rooted in pub-
lic interests and duties, as cQntrasted with
education for the advancement of know-
ledge pure and simple, the University of
Virginia instinctively took a long step in
advance in assuming greater moral ma-
turity in its students; aiming to train
men of affairs in their social relations,
it took for granted a certain preliminary
moral as well as intellectual preparation.
It based its discipline on the sense of hon-
or in its studeiits, and prepared men for
self-government by permitting them to
govern themselves; it went a step beyond,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00602" SEQ="0602" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="596">596	The Intellectual lJfovement in the West.

in harmony with its ideal, and gave its stu-
dents wide latitude in the choice of lines
of study; and it took the further and
final step, inevitable alike in the work-
ing out of its system and in the impulse
received from its founder, and planted
itself on the basis of absolute religious
liberty. Here, then, was a singularly
coherent and consistent expression, along
educational lines, of the ideal of life
which silently formed itself in the mind
of the Virginia community: an ideal es-
sentially social, as the ideal of New
England was essentially individual; an
ideal secular and practical, as the New
England ideal was religions and ethical;
an ideal which involved the training of
communities, as that of New England
involved the training of persons. When
the spiritual history of the continent is
written, five hundred years hence, the
University of Virginia will be given a
much larger place in the making of the
American community than has yet been
set aside for her.
	The richness of the colonies in types
of character, temper, and training is
brought out very strikingly as one fol-
lows the coast line from Boston to New
Orleans. In those early times, New
York was already a town of cosniopoli-
tan interests and habits, speaking eigh-
teen languages before the Revolution-
Philadelphia was combining a certain
quietism of spirit with charm of manner
and sagacity in dealing with practical
affairs. In Charleston there was as
distinct a background of religious con-
viction as in Boston, but it was less
radical in its individualism, and it was
speedily modified by social and economic
conditions. The Huguenots brought into
the new country not only religious con-
victions as deep as those of the Puritan
colonists, but also a large iiifusion of the
best blood of France. Many of their
children were educated in Europe, and
society had the interest and charm of an
intimate contact with the Old World.
	The community at New Orleans ap
proached life from another side, and
produced a type of character with a
distinct touch of the Latin passion for
intimacy of relationship in meeting the
experiences and developing the resources
of life. In this semi-tropical city, which
has not lost its traditional charm of man-
ner, nor that hospitality which adopts
rather than simply includes and enter-
tains, one finds individualism, which is
so prominent in New England, entirely
absorbed in the social ideal: the ideal
which makes the family and the com-
munity the units; which continually
checks the tendency to self-assertion by
insistence upon the superior authority of
the family and the community; which
brings individual opinion to the bar of
general opinion; and which develops
the common life of the community by
drawing into it all that is best in per-
sonal life. Types are thrown into strik-
ing relief by their abnormal illustration
in individuals. In New England, where
the emphasis of nearly three centuries
has been on individuality, the abnormal
characters are distinctly anti-social; they
take refuge in solitude, in isolation from
society, in the extravagant assertion of
their opinions, convictions, and purposes.
They are the victims of a will which
has become tyrannical and irrational.
Many of Miss Wilkinss studies of the
New England degenerate convey an im-
pression of the helplessness of men and
women in whom the will acts arbitrarily,
and is no longer cotirdinated with the
reason. These extreme illustrations of
individualism are the inevitable results,
upon certain classes of minds, of centu-
ries of emphasis on the sovereignty of
the individual conscience. In the South,
on the other hand, the akiormal types
show an excessive development of the
social instinct. They do not hide them-
selves in solitary houses or live like her-
mits; they frequent the taverns, are
found at the country stores, and seem to
seek rather than shun companionship.
The habit of living together is so deep-</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00603" SEQ="0603" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="597">The Intellectual Illliovernent in the West.	597.

seated that it acts automatically when
the mind loses its balance.
	This habit of acting together in all the
affairs of life bears its fruit in New Or-
leans in a grace, ease, and freedom of hu-
man intercourse which owes something,
it must be confessed, to French influence.
The social ideal, which dominates every
kind of organization and every form of
art in France, is modified in the fascinat-
ing city, with its reminiscence of Spain
in the architecture of the older quarters,
its atmosphere of human intimacy in the
presence of the Latin temperament, and
the commercial energy which has its
roots in the American character.
	The art of human intercourse, like
other arts of the deepest charm, i~ not
distinctively intellectual in its origin and
its expression; and its significance as an
expression or product of culture has been
greatly undervalued in this country. The
urbanity, tact, delicate subordination of
self to the ease and comfort of others
the sensitiveness which discerns and
shares other moods and minds without
formal approach; that nice harmonizing
of divergent tempers, dispositions, and
aims which is effected only in a highly
civilized society for the purpose of making
common stock of individual knowledge.
experience, and charm,  these things
are understood in New Orleans, and are
utilized perhaps with more effect than
in any other city in the country. To
the ideal of individual development in
New England, and to that of commu-
nity development in Virginia, New Or-
leans adds an ideal of social development
which could not be lost without losing
one of those graces of living which are
invaluable not only for the pleasure they
give, but also for the refinement of spir-
it which they constantly reveal. This
is the distinctive contribution of New
Orleans, and the communities it repre-
sents, to American civilization.
	In so large a country, with such long
distances between the centres of indus-
try and intelligence, a certain develop-
ment of provincialism was inevitable;
for lack of contact involves lack of know.~
ledge, and lad: of knowledge is the pro-
lific mother of that form of unabashed
and unconscious ignorance which we call
provincialism. Before the Revolution,
the colonies were distrustful and jealous
of one another, because they were in con-
tact at so few points. After the Revo-
lution, the states, into which the original
colonies were divided and subdivided,
looked askance at one another; and the
misconceptions of spirit, aim, and relative
strength which grew out of that soil bore
fruit in the tragedy of the civil war.
This failure to perceive the deeper drift
of affairs, to discern the partial charac-
ter of sectional ideals, and to recognize
the necessity of harmonizing the national
types did not end with the tremendous
shock of two diverse conceptions of the
national idea thirty-five years ago. It
has continued to show itself in the blind-
ness or indifference of the older com-
munities to the spiritual development of
the newer sections of the country; and
this latest provincialism is shown in the
assumption, not uncommon in some parts
of the East, that while material progress
has been phenomenal in the Mississippi
Valley and the Far West, spiritual pro-
gress has not kept pace with it.
	The chief difference between the older
and the newer sections of the country in
the matter of culture is a difference of
time; or, in other words, of opportunity.
The history of the country has been so
far a history of colonization; the wave
of human restlessness and energy which
rolled over the seaboard in the seven-
teenth century has moved across the con-
tinent, and the successive communities
which sprung up in its track have repro-
duced, with certain inevitable modifica-
tions, the stages through which the older
communities passed. Virginia saw her
history repeated in Kentucky, and New
England read her story again in Ohio,
Iowa, and Kansas; and for a genera-
tion the old East and that West which</PB>

was its first-born have been able, if they
~liave had insight, to discern the working
out of their own destiny in the further
West. There have been interruptions,
but there has been no break in the his-
torical process; new influences have
made their appearance and novel condi-
tions have bred strange types, but at
bottom the historical movement has been
continuous and consistent. The West
has passed stage by stage through the
experience of the East. It has had to
create the physical conditions of life, but
it has never been content with them; it
has no sooner laid the material founda-
tions of the state than it has proceeded
to lay its spiritual foundations. It has
not waited to get the rough work done
before taking up the higher work.
	It has founded colleges with too lib-
eral a hand, and the word university
has come to mean, in some sections of
the West, any school above the primary
grade. That the university ideal has
been temporarily cheapened by this reck-
less and misleading use of the word uni-
versity is beyond question. But, apart
from what appears to be the natural ten-
dency of new countries to exaggerate
the rank and importance of undertak-
ings still in the rudimentary stages, the
instinct which prompted the founding of
such a large number of colleges is iden-
tical with that which early began the
work of organizing the higher education
on the seaboard. Many of these col-
leges have not only rendered an imme-
diate service of the highest importance
to the growing communities in which
they were placed, but have maintained
a high level of teaching and scholarship.
The University of Michigan has long
been recognized as one of the centres of
higher education in the country,  a uni-
versity in spirit and standards as well
as in name. Rarely has the practical
value of generous dealing with the edu-
cational question been more significantly
illustrated than in the history of Michi-
gan, a state which has gained in public
regard and in general reputation through
the high standing and widespread fame
of its university. Wisconsin, Minnesota,
and Nebraska have shown a similar
breadth of view in building up and sup-
porting state universities,, which are re-
paying the community an hundredfold
every dollar appropriated to their use.
The group of institutions represented by
the Western Reserve University at Cleve-
land, Miami University, Beloit, Kenyon,
Marietta, Knox, and Iowa colleges have
borne the fruit of personal sacrifice and
unselfish love of knowledge. Often limit-
ed in income, and working, during their
earlier years at least, with very inad-
equate educational apparatus, they have
never lacked the generous service of
men and women of noble character and
of genuine culture, and they have con-
tributed to the active scholarship of the
country some of the most productive and
thoroughly trained men in many de-
partments.
	The University of Chicago is too re-
cent a foundation, and has been too wide-
ly discussed, to need extended comment.
It is easy to point out the mistakes in
the rapid development of an institution
of such magnitude as the new university
on the shore of Lake Michigan, and it
is quite certain that some of the fruits
of the higher culture cannot be plucked
until time has ripened them; but those
who attempt to minimize the work of
this vigorous institution, because it has
not yet completed its first decade, lay
themselves open to the charge of a seri-
ous lack of true vision. A young uni-
versity cannot wholly escape the crudity
which is the healthful characteristic of
youth, because it is the necessary accom-
paninient of all growth; but it is the
very essence of provincialism to be blind
to vitality, energy, and power, because
the use of these great forces is not ideal-
ly mastered at the start. No one who
has spent any time in the atmosphere of
the University of Chicago; has taken ac-
count of the opportunities it offers; has</PB>

become aware of its invigorating influ-
ence on the colleges of the West, and of
the stimulus which it is giving the teach-
ers of the South and West; and has
recognized the far-seeing sagacity with
which it is steadily organizing educa-
tional forces, can question the reality of
the intellectual impulse which it expresses
on such a great scale, or the important
place which it is to occupy in the educa-
tional history of the country. It holds
a strategical point in the development of
the higher civilization, and it is to be
one of the leaders in its spiritual un-
folding.
	That a distinct type of academic life
will be developed at the University of
Chicago, which will reflect and define
the characteristics and aims of the Cen-
tral West, is highly probable. But it
takes time to harmonize temperament
and character, and to give them definite-
ness and firmness of outline; and time is
an element for which the most generous-
ly endowed institution must wait with
such patience as it can command. That
type, when it appears, will present un-
mistakable differences froni the types al-
ready formed in New England, the Mid-
dle States, and the South. It will, sooner
or later, care as much for thoroughness;
for the appreciation of the fundamental
quality of genuine scholarship and of the
intellectual life is only a matter of time,
in a community so energetic, so sensi-
tive to criticism, and so eager to lay
hold of the best in life. It will care for
thoroughness, but it is likely to care
still more for vitality. The peculiar dry-
ness of mind which once infected univer-
sities, as certain fevers infect hospitals,
has of late years almost disappeared,
in the presence of intellectual and social
forces which have stimulated into active
co~iperation or equally energetic antag-
onism the great majority of the most
cultivated men and women; but the de-
tachment from affairs, which always en-
dangers the freshness of feeling and the
sense of partnership with ones people
and ones age among scholars, is not
likely, for a long time to come, to affect
the Western universities.
	The student and scholar in the West
is likely to be not only energetic, but ag-
gressively hopeful and ardently patriotic.
He may not always disclose perfect bal-
ance of intelligence and feeling; he may
sometimes err on the side of optimistic
confidence in the value of what he is do-
ing and what his community is doing.
But fortunate is the country in which
scholars share those deep and vital im-
pulses which keep races productive and
masterful. In their greatest moments,
progressive races are likely to have a
touch of audacity in their temper and a
touch of arrogance in their manners.
This was true of the Greeks of the age
of Pericles, of the Romans of the time
of the Republic, of the Italians of the
Renaissance, and of the English of the
spacious days of great Elizabeth. A
superabundance of life invariably finds
escape in a fuller and more assured note
of self-confldeiice; in an unquestioning
faith that life is not only worth living,
but worth the most intense living. In
answer to the charge of excesses and
violence brought against the Ameri-
can colonists, Burke, with characteristic
breadth of view, urged that something
must be pardoned to the spirit of liberty.
It is a fortunate hour when peoples are
obliged to concede something to the spirit
of life; when vitality is too deep and
too vigorous to find adequate expression
through critical forms, to conform wholly
to accepted opinions, or to wear easily
the conventional garb. Too much vital-
ity is far better than too little vitality,
and the crudest life is more promising
than the most polished death. The note
of boastful self-assertion so often sounded
in the West is irritating because it mis-
reports the real force of the section, and
dreary because it is inflated out of all
proportion to the thought or fact behind
it. There is something touching in the
patience with which Americans in the</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00606" SEQ="0606" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="600">600	The Intellectual ljfovement in the West.

newer sections of the country will listen
to wearisome repetitions of the same
boastful platitudes decade after decade.
The politician whom Mr. Lincoln once
described as throwing back his head, in-
flating his lungs, and leaving the rest to
God is still heard in the West, and some-
times in the East, with an attention which
deserves a better reward.
	But this inflated note is, after all, the
escape of a real force through an in-
ferior personality; there is something
genuine and true behind it, and that
something is the confidence which is
born of the sense of vitality. This sense
the students and scholars of the West
are certain to share; and they are likely
to gain and to keep ultimate leadership
in public life.
	It would not be easy to find a more
characteristically American community
than that which has grown to such large
proportions around Oberlin College. In
this academic village, which contains,
during the college year, a population of
not less than fifteen hundred students of
both sexes, one finds himself in contact
with a life which is shaped exclusively
by American conditions and absorbed in
American interests. Not long ago, an
intelligent student of education in this
country said that, in his judgment, a dol-
lar went further in educational purchas-
ing power at Oberlin than at any other
college in the land. It is probable that
economy of expenditure and lavishness
of opportunity and of work are nowhere
more fruitfully united. The sturdy,
plain, God-fearing, hard-working people,
who have the conscience of the country
so largely in their keeping, have put
behind Oberlin a background of ethical
education which is one of the most im-
portant endowments of the college. The
moral life of the institution is insistent
and bti enuous; one cannot breathe its
atmosphere without becoming conscious
of that moral energy which once found
utterance in Dr. Finneys stirring preach-
ing. but which has found more adequate
expression in the closeness of touch be-
tween the college and the moral agita-
tions and reforms of the last fifty years.
At Oberlin education instinctively shapes
itself for immediate ends in the needs of
the time and the community, and in the
courses of study arid in the interests and
tastes of the students one finds a keemi
sense of the utility of studies for prac-
tical uses. There is little of that sense
of leisure which lingers in the older col-
leges, and gives the undergraduate the
feeling that the four years will never
run their course; there is, in its place,
an alert perception of the value of the
time of preparation, and a great eager-
ness to get to work.
	This does not prevent genuine enjoy-
ment of student life; on time contrary,
no academic life could be more simple
and hearty. The kindlin~ss and frank
sociability which, in certain ways, make
the whole continent one great comnmn-
nity find the freest possible expression
in the village of young men and women,
associating with one another on the most
easy and un~onventional terms. A for-
eign observer would probably find him-
self as much perplexed by social condi-
tions at Oberlin as at any other place
in America; nowhere else would his tra-
(litions and experience be more likely to
mislead him. The contrast between the
English or Continental university and
Oberlin is so marked as to be violent to a
scholar from beyond the sea; even to an
American it is so broad as to be humor-
ous. But if the scholar brought with
him not only traditions, but freshness of
feeling and keenness of insight, he would
soon discern in the conditions at Ober-
lin the most convincing evidence of the
soundness of American character and
the purity of the American home. Such
a community would not be possible in
the seaboard states, North or South; but
it is the natural growth of social condi-
tions in its own wide neighborhood, and
it is one of the most distinctive and in-
teresting places in America to all who</PB>

wish to understand the spiritual life of
the country.
	The view from Colorado College is
perhaps as striking as that which can
be commanded from any college win-
dows. There are those who affirm that
the outlook from Robert College, with
the ceaseless movement of the commerce
of the Bosphorus, is the most enchant-
ing academic prospect in the world; the
charm of the surroundings of Heidelberg
has been felt by generations of travelers;
Cambridge and Oxford have a spell that
no sensitive mind escapes; Williams and
Amherst hold the imagination of their
students loyal to a beauty of hill and
shaded street which exerts no small edu-
cational influence; Wellesley has a no-
ble setting, and Princeton looks across a
charming country. On the campus of
Colorado College one recalls these and
other college outlooks, of exceptional
grandeur or extent or loveliness, and is
fain to confess that this young institution
holds its own among the most fortunate-
ly placed colleges of the world. The ab-
sence of depth of foliage and the restful-
ness of a rich and long cultivated coun-
try finds compensation in the brilliancy
of a mountain background, notable not
only for mass and ruggedness, but also
for color. In the stimulating air one
shares the general faith that on this lofty
plateau, where the continent reaches its
highest habitable altitude, there must be
bred a race of men and women of keen
intelligence and quick imagination, who
will render tbe country higher services
than the opening of mines, the reclama-
tion of great stretches of arid territory to
the uses of agriculture, and the herding
of cattle. The local witticism, that it is
impossible to tell the truth about Colo-
rado without lying, is only another way
of saying that in any complete account
of a country you must include the sky
and the air as well as the soil.
	Colorado College may be taken as a
type of the Far Western college, and as
such it gives every lover of sound learn-
ing the assurance that the light which
has been handed down from generation
to generation with such jealous care will
not suffer any loss of purity or intensity
on the slopes of the Rocky Mountains.
It is not a rich college, for the wealth
of the country is still largely prospec-
tive; but it is well equipped, its endow-
ment is steadily increasing, and the af-
fection and interest of the community
are quietly gathering about it. That
which gives the college its deepest sig-
nificance, however, is the spirit of its
body of self-denying teachers. Bred in
the best traditions of the older commu-
nities, they are putting into their work
not only trained intelligence, but a de-
votion which found expression last year,
when a large sum of money was urgent-
ly needed in order to secure a condi-
tional gift, in a cheerful surrender of a
considerable proportion of salaries al-
ready taxed to the utmost to meet the
most moderate personal expenses. It
is this missionary spirit in the hearts
of men and women who have obtained
thorough special training in their differ-
ent fields, and who are giving themselves,
body and soul, to the work of teaching
in the new West, which furnishes ground
for the belief that the foundations of the
latest commonwealths are as genuinely
ethical and spiritual as those which the
Puritans laid.
	On the Pacific coast, such institutions
as the University of California and the
younger and more aggressive Leland
Stanford University give expression to
the spiritual aspiration of communities
which are still dealing with material
problems in their most pressing forms;
while such noble beginnings of educa-
tional foundations as Whitman College
attest the persistence of that devout
spirit in which so many American col-
leges have had their inception.
	There are too many colleges in cer-
tain sections of the West, especially of
the Central West; and in many cases
these institutions have no claim to the</PB>

use of the word college; but it remains
true that the majority of higher institu-
tions of learning in the West belong, by
right of honorable descent and of pre-
sent service, to the academic brotherhood.
Their foundations are very much larger
than were those of Harvard, Yale, Wil-
liam and Mary, or Princeton at the same
age; they are served by men as thorough-
ly equipped as were the teachers in the
oldest colleges. They are placed in a so-
ciety more alert and energetic, with vig-
orous impulses and a determination to
know and to possess the best life has to
offer; and wherever this vital ambition
controls, time and experience will inevi-
tably correct false ideas of the relative
values of ends, and advance standards
which are too low.
	The few and scattered centres and
sources of intellectual influence which
have been enumerated are representa-
tive of a great group of organized en-
deavors to convey and to advance learn-
ing in the newer parts of the continent;
the work of these institutions is supple-
mented by a great volume of personal
and private effort to the same end.
Those who know the Central West well
are persuaded that it has entered what
may be called the culture stage of its de-
velopment; the stage, that is, which in-
volves a serious attempt to rationalize its
life, to measure its spiritual success, to
secure an accurate estimate of the value
of its material production, to know the
best the older communities have thought
and spoken, to command the ultimate
uses of life and its materials. Those
who can recognize a spiritual develop-
ment in the germ as well as in the com-
plete unfolding are deeply impressed
by the eagerness with which great num-
bers of sincere people are reaching out
after the things of the spirit, and are
determined to possess them. If there
is an immense amount of crudity in this
country, there is also an immense force
of aspiration working in it and through
it.	The head of an Oxford college,
who happened to be at one of those
summer assemblies which have become
a feature of life in many parts of the
country, confessed that all his traditions
as a university man were shocked by
some of the methods and a good deal
of the teaching which he had been ob-
serving; but added that he was filled
with reverence for the hunger and thirst
for knowledge which had become a pas-
sion with a multitude of people whose
work is severe and whose leisure is lim-
ited: men and women of limited educa-
tional opportunities, who were striving
in middle life to gain the outlook on
life which was denied them in youth;
hard-worked mothers, who were patheti-
cally endeavoring to keep within spirit-
ual reach of their more fortunate chil-
dren in college. It is easy to dismiss
the movement which finds expression in
summer schools and assemblies as shal-
low in method and superficial in spirit.
The methods are, it is true, sometimes
inadequate and even cheap, but they
are also, in many cases, intelligent and
wisely planned; and the spirit behind
the movement is quite as deep and gen-
uine and uplifting as that which has
from time to time set great educational
forces at work in older societies. In
the long run, it will be found that these
assemblies and schools are the nurseries
of the colleges and universities; and
that the awkward and sometimes badly
directed endeavor of the unprivileged
classes intellectually to share the higher
resources of civilization with the more
fortunate is not only sound and real,
but the clear prophecy of the approach
of an era of culture in this country,  an
extended though often unconscious en-
deavor to assimilate the culture of the
race, and to realize in clear ideals the
deepest impulses,- instincts, and aspira-
tions of the New World.
	One of the significant signs of this
movement is the enthusiasm with which
Froebels educational ideas have been
received during the last ten years. The</PB>

movement to establish kindergartens has
become national in its scope; mothers
classes have been organized in nearly all
the large cities, as well as in smaller com-
munities; the study of children, as well
as their care, is engrossing the attention
of many of the most intelligent women.
It is a long time since any educational
movement has swept so great a number
of people into its current, and has in-
spired so many sincere and cultivated
women to active coilperation. The two
enthusiastic women who, not long ago,
drove through a considerable section of
one of the Central Western States, and
held out-of-door meetings for the pur-
pose of extending the knowledge of the
kindergarten, showed no exceptional de-
votion to a movement which promises to
become the most important feature of
contemporary educational history. It is
a great mistake to interpret this move-
ment as a new expression of a more in-
telligent conception of motherhood on
the one hand, and of the importance, for
educational purposes, of the years be-
tween three and six on the other hand;
it is deeper and more inclusive. The
Froebelian philosophy is something more
than a system of education; it is a spirit-
ual conception and interpretation of life,
and it has been eagerly received be-
cause it gives rational form and expres-
sion to a deep stirring of spiritual in-
stinct in this country. It identifies
education with the vital processes of
experience; sets the individual in harmo-
nious order with his kind; establishes
science, art, and history on a basis of
revelation; roots all activity and growth
in religion; and interprets the life of the
race in the light of spiritual progression.
Such a conception, in the contention of
diverse theories of religion, art, and edu-
cation, has not only commanded the in-
tellectual assent of a host of open-minded
men and women, but has touched their
imaginations and awakened their enthu-
siasm. It is as a spiritual even more
than as an intellectual movement that
the remarkable spread of the kinder-
garten idea must be interpreted; it is a
significant phase of the movement for
culture.
	One of its chief sources, on this conti-
nent, must be sought in the remarkable
group of men and women who gave the
schools of St. Louis a new and vigorous
impulse more than a quarter of a cen-
tury ago. It is a notable fact that The
Journal of Speculative Philosophy was
issued beyond the Mississippi River, and
that for years an interest in philosophy
was sustained in St. Louis which has
been more directly fruitful along educa-
tional lines than any other movement of
the kind in the history of the country.
That interest did not exhaust itself in
the study of Kant and Hegel; it carried
the larger vision into the interpretation
of art, literature, and teaching. Dr.
Harris, who is now, as Commissioner of
Education, the official representative of
the educational system of the country,
has made philosophical study constantly
fruitful in the application of philosophi-
cal ideas to educational questions. Miss
Blow has made original and important
contributions to the literature of educa-
tion. Mr. Denton J. Snider has inter-
preted literature in its greatest creations
as revelations of the inner structure of
the soul and of the laws of life, in a
series of very suggestive commentaries
on Homer, Dante, Goethe, and Shake-
speare, and has spent many years of en-
thusiastic work in the classroom and on
the platform, expounding what he has
called the four literary Bibles of the
world. In his tireless zeal, the range
of his knowledge, the vitality of his
methods, Mr. Snider is a true descend-
ant of the Humanists; whose wandering
life he has also adopted, moving like a
true missionary of scholarship through
the Central West, and leaving behind
him a new ardor for learning in schools
and communities.
	There are other names associated with
the St. Louis movement which deserve</PB>

an attention that is made impossible by
the limits of this article. The influence
of this group of scholars and thinkers
has made itself felt through a large
part of the Central West, and can be
traced in the deepening of educational
ideas and the freshening of educational
methods.
	The Literary Schools which have
been held under the auspices of the Chi-
cago Kindergarten College, and under
the direction of the friends of the kin-
dergarten in St. Louis, have been not-
able for breadth of view and insight.
Concerned chiefly with the study and
discussion of the most important works
of literature, they have revealed an in-
stinctive tendency to interpret art in
terms of human experience, and to ar-
rive at the fundamental unity which
gives structure and significance to every
manifestation of the human spirit. In
the predominance of the interpretative
over the purely critical or scholastic
spirit, which has characterized the ses-
sions of these schools, some observers
h~ave found the evidence of genuine cul-
ture, and the promise of a vigorous ar-
tistic activity in the future; and to such
observers these schools have seemed to
bring to light a real arid widespread in-
terest in the spiritual achievements of
the race, and a passionate eagerness to
share the spiritual experience of the
race.
	To these observers there come all
manner of confirmations of this convic-
tion from all parts of the West: stories
of eager young scholars who are mak-
ing struggles for educational opportuni-
ties as heroic as those which have
touched the history of the German uni-
versities with a noble idealism, of the
Scotch universities with a courage akin
to the spirit which inspires the Scotch
ballads, and have introduced into the
life of our own older institutions a strain
of the highest moral energy; the inci-
dent of the elaborate carving of the en-
tire interior of a church, in a small com
munity, by the loving skill of a congre-
gation which gave up its leisure hours
for many months in order that the art
of wood-carving might be mastered suffi-
ciently to be put to use in the service of
religion. The product of this zeal may
not remind one of the work of the Flem-
ish carvers, but it was out of the depths
of such a feeling for beauty that the skill
of the Low Countries was born.
	One recalls also the countless organi-
zations for the study of history, political
economy, literature, art, and philosophy
which cover the West with a network of
intellectual influences ; the wide interest
in serious lectures; the general habit of
serious reading, the evidences of which,
in remote localities, surprise the unin-
formed visitor from the East; the large
numbers of students from the West who
are pursuing advanced courses of study
in this country and in Europe.
	It would be impossible to present any
inclusive survey of the signs and evi-
dences of the intellectual activity of the
Central and Far West, and it would be
an impertinence to set these few typical
facts in order, if a certain provincialism
in some of the older sections of the coun-
try did not call for enlightenment. That
provincialism has its roots in an igno-
rance which is easily explained by the
great distances which separate commer-
cial and social centres from one another,
and constitute a serious obstacle to com-
munity of feeling and unity of action in
this country. This ignorance is, unf or-
tunately, shared by many cultivated peo-
ple who ought to be quick to recognize
and sympathize with a spiritual move-
ment of the very highest importance.
That such a movement is the most sig-
nificant fact in the contemporary history
of the West is the conviction of many
who have had the opportunity of becom-
ing acquainted with their own country.
The material progress of the section is
reported with the utmost detail and in
the most flamboyant style; but its real
progress, revealed in its intellectual lio</PB>

eration and its realization of its own
character and work, is very inadequate-
ly presented.
	It is probable that no country has
ever invested so much spiritual, moral,
and monetary capital in education, tak-
ing into account the brevity of its his-
tory, as the West; it has done far more
for its intellectual life than the East did
in the same number of years. It is, in
fact, repeating the history of the East;
for it is eagerly assimilating the expe-
rience of the race, expressed in its
thought, its art, and its history. This is
the impulse behind the passion for know-
ledge,  the instinctive desire to know
what the race knows, and then to codp-
erate in the race life and work. Ia the
face of declamatory assertions of inde
pendence of the past, this instinct stead-
ily asserts itself and has its way. The
struggle of the new community to break
with the race, and start out for itself, is
inspired by a mistaken idea of independ-
ence. Real freedom comes from that
mastery, through knowledge, of historic
conditions and race character which
makes possible a free and intelligent use
of experience for the purposes of pro-
gress. This is the process through
which the West is now passing, and
which gives its society a deep and ap-
pealing interest. For out of this move-
ment for the clear realization in its own
consciousness of its race relationships and
inheritance, modified by its own condi-
tions and shaped by its own needs, are to
come, at no distant date, its own ideals.

have learned is practically the same as
that stated briefly by a French admiral
writing of our victories in 1812 There
is success only for those who know how
to prepare it. Our chief glory, there-
fore, is careful preparation and an accu-
rate fitting of means to end. This re-
mark applies mainly to the individual
ships in service before the war broke out,
and not to the general preparedness of
the country for a severe struggle. There
are many elements which go toward suc-
cess in war, and the commonest of these
is courage. Most nations, with proper
training and good leadership, will pro-
duce good soldiers; it is only a question
of time. Thorough familiarity with the
weapons and instruments placed in their
hands is one of the requisites even of
courage. The lack of mechanical in-
stinct accounts for the failure of some
nations to produce first-rate seamen, es-
pecially in these days of machinery upon
the sea. This quality is perhaps the
vital difference between Americans and
Spaniards. The latter seem incapable
of grappling with the construction and
management of guns and machinery.
The war, therefore, sets clearly before
our people the value of education and
technical training to a specific end, and
the lesson is applicable as well to the vo-
cations of peace as to the preparations
for war.
	But at no time have we been prepared
for a prolonged conflict against a well-
equipped navy, and our fortunate exodus
from the affair should serve as a warn-
ing. We had at the outset only a few
well-selected types of ships manned by a
first-rate personnel, or what has been
called the nucleus of a good navy. The
smaller craft for picket, patrol, and
supply duty had to be obtained and
equipped in a great hurry. In not a
few cases the money placed at the dis-
posal of the President was squandered,
to the minimum benefit of the country.
This is doubtless inevitable in stress of
emergency, when all the safeguards of
purchase and inspection do not obtain.
On the eve of the recent war the supply
of powder for the navy was at a very
low ebb, through the neglect of Congress,
and the Bureau of Ordnance deserves no
small credit for making good the defi-
ciency so quickly that not a ship lacked
ammunition when the demand for it
came. This speaks volumes for the ef-
ficiency of the system prevailing in the
Navy Department.
	While our ships were individually well
prepared for the conflict, the fleets as a
whole were at first composed of ill-as-
sorted vessels. There had never been
a settled policy in Congress looking to-
ward the development of the navy. As
a consequence, we find monitors of ten
knots speed and torpedo boats of twenty
knots associated in the blockade of Cuba.
The squadron that went to Porto Rico
was made up of battleships, torpedo
boats, and monitors, with an average
speed pulled down from fifteen to ten
knots for the benefit of the last-named.
It seems absurd to have expected vessels
of little freeboard and of minimum coal
capacity, designed especially for harbor
defense, to cruise in squadron, and yet
the department was forced into the se-
lection of these ships for want of others.
Then, again, we had no choice but to
send two monitors on the long cruise
across the Pacific. The torpedo boats
suffered all kinds of ill usage, even tak-
ing part in the bombardment of shore
fortifications. They served as tenders,
dispatch boats, scouts, and in fact as any-
thing except torpedo boats. Some of
them carried only a few hours supply of
fresh water for their boilers, which would
have been ruined by the free introduction
of salt water; nevertheless, they were
required to steam hundreds of miles.
It seemed a pity, but the officers felt
obliged to use what was at hand, rather
than to delay the campaign for boats
better adapted to the purpose. Later,
the converted yachts and tugs, armed in
great haste, arrived to take their places.</PB>

And it may be added that these little
boats rendered effective service; two of
them participated in the battle of Sant-
iago.
	The history of the naval part of the
war falls naturally into four chapters, 
the preparation, the blockade, and the
total destruction of two fleets; but it is
not the purpose of this article to give
more than a passing glance at the two
principal events. Our small fleet in the
Pacific went from Hong Kong to Ma-
nila, destroyed a Spanish fleet, and held
the bay until an American army arrived
to control the situation on land. A fleet
in the Atlantic closed up the harbors of
Cuba, and destroyed a second Spanish
fleet off Santiago. Incidentally, there
were many smaller conflicts in Cuban
waters.
	The problems which confronted the
commanders on the two oceans were es-
sentially different, and time will show
them to have been solved with equal
ability and good sense. The situation
at Manila was very simple. Upon the
declaration of war, Admiral Dewey was
turned out of Hong Kong by Great Brit-
ain, and all other Asiatic ports were
closed to him. He was seven thousand
miles from home, a distance which none
of his ships could make without recoal-
ing, and his line of communication was
liable to interruption at any time. Fur-
thermore, the safety of our Pacific coast
trade was in jeopardy so long as a hostile
vessel remained in the Orient. The duty
was a plain one,  to obtain a base in
the Philippines, and to capture or destroy
every Spanish ship that could be found.
With rare good judgment, Admiral
Dewey made straight for Manila, and
caught the whole fleet before they had
time to scatter. He had already proven
himself to be a man of foresight by load-
ing up with provisions and coal before
war was declared. When the English
told him to go he was ready. His fleet
passed through the fortified entrance
of Manila bay by night, and attacked
the ships and shore batteries simultane-
ously. The victory over what must be
conceded to have been a weak and dis-
organized foe, although gun for gun
there was not much difference between
the two sides, was a great one, in the
splendid management of the American
ships, and in the results which must flow
from our enforced entrance into Asiatic
politics.
	There was not an armored ship on
either side, and the battle sheds little
light upon construction for the future.
We know that the Spaniards suffered
fearfully from fire, and that our ships
escaped with little damage. No victory
was ever purchased more cheaply ; not
a man was killed on the American side.
	The task before Admiral Sampson
was immensely more complicated. He
had to maintain the blockade over a long
coast line, to be on the lookout for tor-
pedo boats and ships whose whereabouts
he could not fix, and to convoy troop
ships. The sustained readiness and vi-
gilance of the fleet, during its long wait
before Santiago, were enough in them-
selves to make the reputation of an or-
dinary commander-in-chief. Added to
these duties he had to contend with cer-
tain newspaper reporters and dispatch
boats, striving to ascertain his plans for
the benefit of their unscrupulous em-
ployers. The last was not the least of
his difficulties, and the attempt of the
Associated Press to besmirch his reputa-
tion and to deprive him of the credit of
Santiago sprang, no doubt, from disap-
pointment in obtaining authentic news as
to his intentions. The first expedition
against Porto Rico was practically ruined
by the press, and the slightest movement
of any ship was promptly cabled home
by way of neutral lines over which the
government could exercise no control.
The Spaniards thus obtained regular in-
formation of the location of our squad-
rons, and profited by it in directing Ad-
miral Cerveras fleet. The astonishing
feature of the matter is that the Navy</PB>

Department should have prohibited com-
munication of war news by officers, and
then have forced newspaper reporters
upon them to pick up and to color the
bits of information they could glean. It
was only natural that our people should
want news of their fleet, and some of the
newspapers served them well. The end
would have been attained far better by
placing an officer on the stiff of every
commander of a squadron, with author-
i~y to supply legitimate news which
would not affect the conduct of the cam-
paign. The element of the picturesque
might have been lacking, but the de-
scriptions would have been accurate.
This, however, would not have elitninat-
ed the dispatch boat. It was common
talk in the fleet, after the return to New
York, that an Associated Press boat had
led the Oregon a chase of one hundred
miles toward Jamaica, and when finally
hauled up had displayed her flag, and
treated the matter as a huge joke.
	The progress of the blockade, the nu-
merous attacks upon Spanish fortifica-
tions, and the search for Admiral Cerve-
ras fleet will form an interesting story
when all the threads can be gathered
together in a connected whole. The
work of the navy in the West Indies
was virtually completed at Santiago, and
our ships were set free for a movement
against the coast of Spain. As the At-
lantic was at the same time freed from
all danger of fleet cruisers, the home
coast no longer required protection. The
naval battle at Santiago was very dif-
ferent from that at Manila, in the char-
acter of the ships engaged. The Span-
iards had six of their best vessels: four
armored cruisers, and two very fast tor-
pedo destroyers, with an average speed
of eighteen and a half knots. We had
four battleships, two armored cruisers,
and several smaller craft, with a mean
speed of fifteen and a half knots. In
both cases, the maximum speed of the
slowest ship is taken as the average for
the fleet. There were only two very fast
ships on the American side, the New
York and the Brooklyn, and the for-
mer was hull down to eastward of the
harbor. Admiral Cerveras plan was,
therefore, to go out quickly, turn to the
westward along the coast, and disable the
Brooklyn before the slower ships could
come to her rescue, thus carving out a
road to the sea. The plan, though well
conceived, could be carried out only in
part. He did not succeed in disabling
the Brooklyn, which was evidently ma-
nwuvred with a view to chasing, and five
of his ships were overwhelmed by the
American fleet before they had time to
gather full headway. The battle had
resolved itself into but little more than
an exciting target practice for our ships,
when each Spanish vessel, in turn, head-
ed toward the beach, and hauled down
her flag. The Cristobal Colon, which
had passed through the fire without in-
jury, and had escaped to the westward,
survived only two hours. The Brook-
lyn, and, to the surprise of everybody,
the Oregon, overtook her about fifty
miles from the mouth of the harbor.
Her burst of speed had lasted only a
short time, and she had not averaged
more than fourteen knots, just six knots
less than she was capable of making.
Her captain struck his flag and ran her
ashore without a fight. Our ships did
their work with the precision of ma-
chines set up on shore, and nothing broke
down in stress of action. The rapid and
complete destruction of the whole Span-
ish fleet, within three hours and a half
after it had emerged under full head of
steam, forms a victory big enough for
all of us, as reported by Admiral Schley;
and yet one cannot help sympathizing
with the American commander who said,
Dont cheer, boys; they are dying.
We lost only one man.
	When the Spanish ships came out, the
Oregon and the Gloucester appear to
have been the only ships ready for them,
and nothing but lack of engineering skill
prevented two of theni from escaping.</PB>

Had the Colon really attained her speed,
she could easily have outrun all the
American ships. As it was, the Brook-
lyn, which should have overhauled her
rapidly, was distanced at the start. The
unexpected had occurred, and she was
not ready. Some of her boilers had no
steam, and the forward propelling en-
gines were not coupled up. Fifteen or
twenty miles would have been lost in
bringing her to full speed, if the Colon
could have done her best. The Iowa and
the Indiana were even worse off than the
Brooklyn. The Oregon, on the other
hand, was able to make even better than
her maximum recorded speed in less than
half an hour after the order was given.
From a position of fourth place in the
line, she passed the other ships and over-
took even the Brooklyn, a faster ship
by four knots. It is very comforting to
know that Admiral Cerveras plan would
not have succeeded, even if he had been
able to overcome the Brooklyn.
	The Oregons performance, which offi-
cers of other ships pronounce one of the
most magnificent sights ever witnessed,
will always remain the ideal toward
which our navy must strive. She made
a long voyage, at fair speed, from Cali-
fornia to the coast of Florida, without
accident or repairs, and joined Admiral
Sampsons fleet in first-rate condition
for immediate duty. After a number
of weeks off Santiago, she was still ready
to do her best, and even to excel any-
thing else on the station. This splendid
record was possible only with good work-
manship and a very capable engineering
staff. This combination is a necessary
requisite to the highest success of a well-
conducted battleship under steam. The
readiness of the Oregon to do her best
illustrates in a forcible manner the in-
fluence of small things upon a ships
career. Her steam joints were all tight.
Consequently, there was so little waste
of steam or of fresh water that no sea
water had to be pumped into her boilers,
and none of the boilers had to be laid
	VOL. LxXxii. NO. 493.	39
off for cleaning and repairs during the
entire blockade. The other ships had
greater or less difficulty in making up
the fresh water supply, and their boilers
suffered from the use of salt water.
When Cervera appeared, the Oregon had
good fires in every furnace.
	Another marked feature of the battle
was, the part taken by the Gloucester, a
converted yacht with a few rapid-fire
guns placed on board. Her maximum
speed was fully a knot below that of the
slowest Spanish ship, and she had no
protection to her machinery; yet her
commander fearlessly turned her against
the two dreaded torpedo boat destroyers,
while they were still under the protec-
tion of the shore batteries and of the
enemys fleet. As he says in his report:
It was the plain duty of the Gloucester
to look after the destroyers, and she was
held back gaining steam until they ap-
peared at the entrance. In the cap-
tains reports, several of the battleships
claim to have struck one of them with a
heavy shell. It is probable that they
were both finished by the Gloucester. If
Commander Wainwrights action savors
of rashness, let one.stop to ask whether
it was not better to risk a small yacht
against torpedoes than to send in a bat-
tleship. It was as deliberate a piece of
self-renunciation as we have in our his-
tory. There is a curious story connected
with this incident. When the Gloucester
turned to intercept the torpedo destroy-
ers, she had to cross the line of fire from
the Indiana, and her captain felt quite
reassured by a signal on the latter ship
which he read, Gunboats will close in.
The commanding officer of the Indiana
afterward stated that the signal he or-
dered was, The torpedo boats are com-
ing out.
	The Spaniards appear to have been
frightened, and their officers to have
taken advantage of the earliest possible
excuse for running their ships ashore.
As one ~f the Oregons officers re-
marked: The Colon was weak. She</PB>

surrendered with a good two hours fight
left in her. Beyond the fact that they
came out to hazard an escape in the face
of great odds, there are few acts of hero-
ism recorded in their favor. Their men
were slaughtered and their ships de-
stroyed, with little damage to their foe.
	The deficiency of mechanical skill
throughout the Spanish navy was count-
ed upon to give our sailors a decided ad-
vantage, but no one supposed the Span-
iards would display what at this distance
looks like cowardice. It may have been
the untrained man in the presence of
the machine. Courage springs from two
sources,  experience in the work which
the meii have to do, and entire confi-
dence in their leaders. Even a brave
man may run from a cow, if he has not
been brought up on a farm. Familiar-
ity with guns and machinery is the es-
sential element of success in a modern
battleship. It was probably ignorance
which robbed the Spaniard of his
courage. Added to this, he found him-
self so suddenly under a withering fire
that he could do nothing with his own
guns. The board ordered to examine
the wrecks found many of the guns load-
ed, thus indicating the haste with which
their crews had deserted them. Some
of the gunsights had evidently been set
for thirty-nine hundred yards at the be-
ginning of the action, and they had never
been changed, although the ships had
closed up to a thousand or fifteen hun-
dred yards. The most significant aspect
of this sad failure is that it sprang from
deficiency in that kind of knowledge
which probably cannot be supplied in
many generations.
	For obvious reasons, the war has shed
little light upon future developments in
naval warfare. Many details of con-
struction will be changed, no doubt; but
there have been no startling revelations
destined to render our battleships anti-
quated, or even seriously to impair their
efficiency. Hereafter the minimum of
combustible materials will enter into the
construction of fighting ships. The bat-
tle of the Yalu in the Japanese-Chinese
war, and the two great battles of this
war, have demonstrated beyond perad-
venture the danger from fire. In many
cases the Spaniards were driven from
their guns by burning woodwork, and
their fire mains were cut by shell. This
experience will relegate all water mains
and steam pipes to the hold well below
the water line, with branches rising to
the necessary connections on the upper
decks.
	The value of rapid-fire guns was so
clearly shown at Santiago that improve-
ment can hereafter follow only along the
line of a more rapid fire. The smaller
guns are already fitted with special
mechanism to facilitate loading and fir-
ing, and we shall be obliged to extend
the system to the whole battery. Our
chief lesson, however, in connection with
battleships is that we need more of them.
The cost is great, but these ships are
well-nigh impregnable; and they must
continue to hold their own as our main
reliance for offense and defense. High-
er speeds will undoubtedly be demand-
ed. The coal problem has apparently
solved itself. Our ships found no trou-
ble in taking coal from colliers at sea,
and it was habitually done at Santiago
before Guantanamo bay was captured.
It follows, therefore, that a coaling sta-
tion is a convenience, and not an abso-
lute necessity, in conducting a campaign
far from home ports.
	Cruisers like the Columbia and the
Minneapolis had no real test. As scouts
they are too large, and as fighting ves-
sels they are of no real value against an
armored fleet. The country would profit
by putting the money for such ships into
a subsidy for merchant vessels of suffi-
cient size to serve as transports or scouts
in emergency. The smaller cruisers and
gunboats did fine work at Manila and
on the blockade, but we must not con-
clude from their immunity against shore
batteries in Cuba that they would be</PB>

equally fortunate again. Some of the
attacks seem almost foolhardy, and the
use of torpedo boats in a fortified harbor,
except as a desperate measure, should
not be encouraged.
	We have learned next to nothing about
torpedoes. They played no part in the
war, except as a moral barrier at Sant-
iago. It seems doubtful if they will
ever prove dangerous to any but a care-
less foe; on the other hand, they may
become a source of real peril to the ship
which is trying to use them. Two torpe-
does exploded on the Almirante Oquen-
do, and killed a great number of men.
One was reported to have been struck
by the fragments of a shell, and the oth-
er to have been set off by the heat of the
flames near it. A loaded torpedo may
thus become a more serious menace to
friend than to foe. The fast torpedo
boat accomplished none of the terrific
feats we expected. The duties per-
formed by our own boats have already
been described, and the principal busi-
ness of the Spanish destroyers was evi-
dently to keep out of the way. Their
defeat by an ordinary yacht must have
been very humiliating. One advantage
possessed by our fleet around the entrance
to Santiago harbor added materially to
their harmlessness: the attack could come
only from one quarter, and the skillful
manipulation of search lights destroyed
all hope of success. The contrast be-
tween our early fears of the torpedo boat
flotilla and its subsequent achievements
is simply ludicrous. It would not be
safe to draw sweeping conclusions as to
the use of these craft in future wars.
If the Pluton and the Furor had been
handled by Englishmen, the Gloucester
would probably be at the bottom of the
sea, and some of the larger ships might
possibly have suffered a like fate.
	The monitors seem to have been out
of their element on the blockade. We
had no need of them in the defense of
coast or harbors, and, with none of the
excitement of the chase, they served prin
cipally as prisons for a few unhappy of-
ficers and men. Our experimental craft,
such as the dynamite cruiser, the sub-
marine boat, and the ram, had no oppor-
tunity to indicate their possible utility.
The Vesuvius threw a few hundred
pounds of dynamite upon the hills out-
side of Santiago, and she may have ex-
erted some moral pressure toward the
surrender, but there is nothing to prove
that she is of value to the country.
	Men are, after all, more important than
types of ships, and we may well inquire
what we have learned about them in
stress of action. It has been asserted
that the war has demonstrated the per-
fection of our organization, and that it
cannot be improved. This is like se-
lecting a crew for a four mile race by a
half mile spurt. The trade of the sea-
man has been changing during the past
generation. and while we know him in
peace, we have not had time to study
him in a war which would call out all
his strength and resources. We could
make no greater mistake than to rest
satisfied with what we have, in the face
of the additions and changes destined to
come during the next ten years. Con-
gress authorized almost a new navy dur-
ing its late session, and we have that to
consider in the new organization. So
far as physical courage is concerned, we
have seen that our sailors possess the
same qualities in the presence of the ma-
chine that their ancestors possessed in
the old sailing frigate. Time has not
changed their nature, however much it
may have modified their occupation.
	The attempt of Somers, ninety-four
years ago, to destroy the Tripolitan fleet
with a fire ship is paralleled by Hobson
on the Merrimac. The two cases have
many points in common: both crews
carried explosives for the destruction of
their ships; both planned to escape in
small boats after having applied the
match; both entered boldly a well-forti-
fied channel; both left friends waiting
outside to pick them up; and both failed</PB>

The Navy in the
to accomplish what they had set out to do.
There the likeness ceases. One went in
under steam, with directive power de-
pendent upon himself, and all his men
were saved; the other depended upon
wind and sails, and all were lost. The
deed of ilobson and his crew is only what
we have a right to expect of our men and
our race. Many officers of the fleet vol-
unteered for duty as soon as they heard
that the Merrimac was to go in. Few
other opportunities for individual hero-
isin presented themselves, and our list
is brief only on that account. The jour-
ney of Lieutenant Blue on a scouting
expedition around Santiago, the coolness
of Cadet Powell waiting close under the
batteries in a steam launch to carry back
the Merrimac s crew, and the rescue of
many prisoners from their burning ships
are all of a piece.
	The contrast between the two nations
stands out very clearly in connection
with the Yizcaya. The torpedo boat
Ericsson ran close alongside of her, and
sent a small boat to take off all that
were alive of her crew. A few boats
from the Iowa assisted. The Vizcaya
was on fire fore and aft; the ammuni-
tion on board was exploding, and the
guns that had been left loaded were go-
ing off one after another in the intense
heat, to say nothing of the proximity of
the shore. The position of the little craft
has been described as perilous in the
extreme. Our men risked their lives
repeatedly to help their fallen enemy;
but no sooner were the Spaniards trans-
ferred to the deck of the Ericsson than
they urged immediate withdrawal, with-
out regard to their comrades who had
been left behind. To the honor of our
navy, Lieutenant Ushur remained until
every living being had been rescued from
the burning ship. A similar scene was
enacted around the two torpedo boat de-
stroyers. It was a case of mad panic
on the one side, and of perfect coolness
on the other. One officer of the Vizcaya
afterward stated, on board the Iowa, that
War with Spain.

they were obliged to close the gun ports
on the disengaged side of the ship, to
prevent the men from jumping overboard
rather than face the American gun fire.
	Even the cadets fresh from the Naval
Academy caught the spirit of their coun-
trymen, and entered into the contest
with the greatest zeal and fearlessness.
During the blockade, a number of picket
launches were kept close around the en-
trance every night, to guard against sur-
prise. These small boats, in charge of
cadets, sometimes approached within a
hundred feet of the shore, and remained
all night. They had orders to go out at
the first streak of dawn, and they were
almost invariably fired on. One boat
got nine shots through her hull. The
danger seemed to be an incentive to
these boys, and there was considerable
rivalry among them for the privilege of
taking the night picket.
	The behavior of the seamen, firemen,
and marines was beyond praise. Hap-
pily few lost their lives, while all were
prepared to risk them. The story of the
men in the fire rooms of the Oregon has
the true ring of the old navy. They
had no share in the exciting, spectacular
part of the fight. Their duty was sim-
ply to push the ship ahead with all their
might. Shut up below an armored deck
in watertight compartments, they were
in the presence of dangers which they
could not see, and their safety depended
upon the good judgment and courage of
their comrades. Yet they thought only
of getting their ship into action. In
the long chase of the Colon the strain
began to tell on them, and the chief en-
gineer, walking up to the bridge, re-
quested the captain to fire a gun just
to cheer my men up. The roar of a
thirteen-inch rifle acted like magic upon
their flagging energies, and gave them
a new incentive to shovel coal. Apart
from the rapidity of movement intro-
duced by steam, the whole scene resem-
bles the old fleet actions of the English
navy in its best days. We may safely</PB>

say that the blockade of Santiago, the
carefully planned attack, and the total
destruction of six good ships were car-
ried out in a manner worthy of the finest
traditions of our race.
	Few details of the battle of Manila
have reached us, but we may be sure that
officers and men were inspired by the
example of Admiral Dewey. The great
central fact of his entering a landlocked
bay on the other side of the world, and
without hesitation attacking a fleet under
the guns of shore batteries, will forever
give a character to this battle. As vic-
tory has meant so much, defeat would
have been fatal to him. Its profound
significance cannot now be measured.
The admirals signal to haul off for
breakfast is not the least characteristic
part of the battle.
	There is another question in relation
to organization aside from the qualities
of individual men. Every seaman must
fulfill a special function in addition to
being as generally useful as possible in
making his ship a fighting machine.
The war has confirmed some theories in
this direction, and the tendency to edu-
cate all combatants, especially officers,
in machinery, or what is better, in en-
gineering, will doubtless be acceler&#38; ted.
The fate of battle will always be gov-
erned by men, whatever the changes in
store for us may be, but their education
must be adapted to the times. The man
of wood and hemp must give way to his
successor of iron and steel.
	Fears were expressed from time to
time, before the war, that our engineer-
ing force would prove insufficient, and
that the machinery would therefore
suffer from lack of intelligent care. The
first of these fears was ftund to be jus-
tified, and a large number of volunteer
engineers, many of them young men of
no experience in marine work, were add-
ed to the list. Notwithstanding, on the
whole they have done as well as could
be expected.
	The anxiety over the performance of
machinery has proved to be groundless,
as engines and boilers have done re-
markably well. No serious breakdown
hampered the movement of any ship,
and the fleets were able to go about
their business without undue delay. It
was to be expected that materials put
into machinery and snbjected to wear
would suffer, and the Navy Department
very wisely made provisions for rapid
repairs. The Vulcan, a ship specially
fitted as a repair shop, and capable of
dealing with all ordinary casualties, was
sent to Santiago before the battle. This
development is a new one, and we have
reason to be well satisfied with it.
	The whole subject of the education
and training of officers had been under
serious discussion for a year before war
was declared, and the opinion of the
navy had gradually crystallized into a
bill in Congress for the improvement of
the personnel. This bill was drawn up
by a board of officers, with Mr. Roose-
velt as chairman, and the Secretary of
the Navy presented it to Congress with
his approval last winter. It was report-
ed favorably to the House of Represent-
atives by the committee, but the pressure
of other business forced it into the sec-
ond session. The measure provides for
a combination of the deck officers and
engineers into one corps; for such a flow
of promotion that officers will reach
command rank before they have passed
middle life; and for pay substantially
equal to that of the army, grade for
grade. It remains to be seen how far
the results of the war will modify the
views of the service on this subject. At
present, every clause of the bill seems to
have been strengthened. The last two
parts will be accepted without dissent
by all persons interested in the improve-
ment of the national service. The first
part, which really looks toward the edu-
cation of all officers in engineering, has
already been accomplished to a certain
extent in the duties of the men without
change of title. As the captain of one</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00620" SEQ="0620" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="614">	614	The Navy in the War with Spain.
of our ships writes me: I am asked
often to account for the little injury to
lives or ships. One great reasoii is
that many of us are seamen, and most
of us engineers; we should all be both
seamen and engineers.
	It was a curious phase of the war to
find deck officers serving as engineers
on torpedo boats, and an engineer serv-
ing as deck officer on a converted yacht.
The change from one duty to the other
is not so violent as it seems, for the men
received practically the same education
at the Naval Academy. Our striking
success is chargeable in a large mea-
sure to familiarity with machines. There
was little opportunity for the desperate
courage which the Spanish might have
displayed. It would appear, therefore,
that any system which contemplates a
more thorough training in engineering
all through the navy is in the right di-
rection.
	The proper promotion of officers in
time of peace has always presented
great difficulty, and the navy list is like
a long line of men toiling gradually up-
ward without regard to ability or zeal.
We dare not adopt a system of selection
for advancement, through fear of open-
ing wide the door to political and social
intrigue in Washington. The war has
developed a method of promotion which
might almost be called iniquitous. When
the advancement of officers has been
accomplished by pushing backward other
deserving men, the result is bad enough;
but when officers have been advanced
simply for being present in an engage-
ment, the whole service may well feel
disheartened. All captains, first lieu-
tenants, and chief engineers in the bat-
tle of Santiago were promoted in num-
bers at the expense of their seniors.
Most of them contributed to the success
of the battle~ and are no doubt worthy;
but some of them have been carried on
the shoulders of their juniors for so many
years as to be incapable of responsible
service. In justice to the navy, the whole
list should be scrutinized in Congress
with the greatest care. It would be bet-
ter to promote none than to reward men
whose careers have been a discredit to
the navy.
	This war has called attention to prize
money as a blot upon the civilization of
the dawning century. Congress should
abolish it in the same bill which ad-
vances the pay of the navy to an equal-
ity with that of the army. The better
sentiment of the whole service would
sustain such action. While so much is
appearing in the newspapers about Ad-
miral Sampson and his prize money, a
remark of his, bearing indirectly on the
subject, may prove illuminating. In a
conversation last fall, I suggested a
method of increasing the pay of officers
as an inducement for continued good
service and study, and the admiral said:
No, that wont do. The word induce-
ment is bad. You will get the best
work out of officers from a high sense of
duty, and not otherwise.
	The lessons for peace taught by this
war should not pass without profit to the
nation. We learn the value and efficien-
cy of training to a specific end. Our
consular service and our civil service
can ~e vastly improved by requiring all
applicants for office to give some evi-
dence of special fitness for the positions
which they seek to fill. On the other
hand, the inefficiency and waste of a
bad system are plainly exhibited in the
unhappy experience of the War Depart-
ment. The two services present a strik-
ing contrast, although the officers of
both have been educated at government
schools. The army, unfortunately, is not
looked upon as a profession, and any
one who has sufficient political influence
is regarded as competent for a commis-
sion. Officers educated at West Point
are set aside, and the service is so dilut-
ed with inexperienced men that its es-
prit is well-nigh destroyed, and its effi-
ciency seriously impaired. The same
scandal has always attended the forma</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00621" SEQ="0621" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="615">The Navy in the War with ~Spain.	615

tion of an army in the United States,
and our country has in every case been
denied the full benefit of its expenditure
for the education of army officers. There
is no doubt of the quickness with which
our enlisted force responds to training.
By sheer good sense and native self-re-
liance, they can sometimes offset the ig-
norance of their officers, as an intelli-
gent horse often knows the way home
better than its master. Their principal
difficulty springs from inability of the
country to secure the proper men to train
them. Through political aspirations or
downright stupidity, even a Secretary
of War may become an insurmountable
obstacle to the effectiveness of his own
department.
	The army may well take a lesson
from the navy in this matter. During
the late war many volunteer commis-
sions were issued in the navy, but the
recipients were invariably placed in sub-
ordinate positions where they came un-
der the directions of regular officers.
Besides this precaution, every officer ap-
pointed in the line and engineer corps
had to pass an examination to establish
his competency. The administration
of the Navy Department has been wise
in this respect, aided doubtless by the
nature of the seamans calling. The
chaos that might have been created by
a political secretary can be more easily
imagined than described. It is to be
hoped that years of peace will never
lead the country into a volunteer estab-
lishment for the navy, like the state
organizations for the arn~y. The naval
reserves belonging to the different states
have filled a gap for the time being, but
their permanent usefulness has not been
established. However courageous the
individual members may be, they carry
into the service local influences essential-
ly disorganizing. The habit of reach-
ing the President and the Navy Depart-
ment through governors and senators
cannot fail to undermine discipline. The
idea that courage in the face of an en-
emy makes up for other deficiencies is
too prevalent. Obedience and attention
to a carefully planned routine become
at times far more important elements in
holding a command to its work for any
length of time. The difference in effec-
tiveness between the marines at Guanta-
namo and the soldiers at Santiago, after
they had been three weeks in the ene-
mys country, is sufficient proof of that.
The naval reserve should be wholly un-
der national control, and not in any
way connected with a state. The rela-
tion of the navy to the general govern-
ment would seem to warrant more ef-
fective organization than the army. It
must always take the first blow in any
foreign war, and its readiness to act may
in some eases become the surest guaran-
tee of peace.
	The spectacular side of the war has
attracted the whole attention of the press,
and we have read much about the nerve
and coolness of individuals under fire.
It is unquestionably a great thing for a
man to risk his life for his country, but
there is something to be said for the
men who are behind him. Efficiency
in supplying the needs of a fleet or an
army, and in maintaining it in a condi-
tion for effective work, is not so common
that we can afford to pass it by in si-
lence, while the combatant is earning
distinction and promotion. The credit-
able record of guns and machinery
throughout the war does not spring from
chance or solely from the skill of the
ships officers and crews, and Congress
should find some method of rewarding
the administrative officers responsible
for them.
	The head of the navy deserves the
gratitude of the whole nation for a wise
and sensible administration. There has
been no interference with the duties be-
longing properly to trained officers, and
no selection of civilians for duties which
they could not perform. The efficiency
of a navy depends as much upon the
strength and intelligence which control</PB>

it as it does upon the ships and person-
nel. Suppose, for instance, that a weak
secretary had directed Admiral Dewey
to establish a pacific blockade of Ma-
nila! The result would have been dis-
astrous, and the war might have been
indefinitely prolonged. The case is not
an imaginary one, as worse errors have
been committed in other wars ; in fact,
even in this war they were committed
by the Spanish naval administration.
We have much to be thankful for in
having found two true and loyal sons of
America at the head of the Navy Depart-
ment during the early days of prepara-
tion for action, when Dewey was sup-
plied with coal and ammunition, and the
standard of accomplishment was set.

MESSMATES.

HE gave us all a good-by cheerily
At the first dawn of day;
We dropped him down the side full drearily
When the light died away.
It s a dead dark watch that be s a-keeping there,
And a long, long night that lags a-creeping there,
Where the Trades and the tides roll over him,
And the great ships go by.

He s there alone, with green seas rocking him
For a thousand miles round;
He s there alone, with dumb things mocking him,
And we re homeward bound.
It s a long, lone watch that he s a-keeping there,
And a dead cold night that lags a-creeping there,
While the months and the years roll over him,
And the great ships go by.

I wonder if the tramps come near enough,
As they thrash to and fro,
And the battleships bells ring clear enough
To be heard down below;
If through all the lone watch that he s a-keeping there,
And the long, cold night that lags a-creeping there,
The voices of the sailor-men shall comfort him
When the great ships go by.

make my acquaintance; but the bears
kept out of my way.
	An old mountaineer, in reply to my
questions, told me that bears were very
shy, all save grim old grizzlies, and that
I might travel the mountains for years
without seeing one, unless I gave my
mind to them and practiced the stealthy
ways of hunters. Nevertheless, it was
only a few weeks after I had received
this information that I met the one men-
tioned above, and obtained instruction
at first-hand.
	I was encamped in the woods about a
mile back of the rim of Yosemite, beside
a stream that falls into the valley by the
way of Indian Caiion. Nearly every
day for weeks I went to the top of the
North Dome to sketch; for it commands
a general view of the valley, and I was
anxious to draw every tree and rock
and waterfall. Carlo, a St. Bernard
dog, was my companion,  a fine, intel-
ligent fellow that belonged to a hunter
who was compelled to remain all sum-
mer on the hot plains, and who loaned
him to me for the season for the sake
of having him in the mountains, where
he would be so much better off. Carlo
knew bears through long experience,
nnd he it was who led me to my first in-
terview, though he seemed as much sur-
prised as the bear at my unhunter-like
behavior. One morning in June, just as
the sunbeams began to stream through
the trees, I set out for a days sketching
on the dome; and before we had gone
half a mile from camp Carlo snuffed
the air and looked cautiously ahead,
lowered his bushy tail, drooped his ears,
and began to step softly like a cat, turn-
ing every few yards and looking me in
the face with a telling expression, saying
plainly enough, There is a bear a little
way ahead. I walked carefully in the
indicated direction, until I approached a
small flowery meadow that I was famil-
iar with, then crawled to the foot of a
tree on its margin, bearing in mind what
I had been told about the shyness of
bears. Looking out cautiously over the
instep of the tree, I saw a big, burly cin-
namon bear, about thirty yards off, half
erect, his paws resting on the trunk of
a fir that had fallen into the meadow, his
hips almost buried in grass and flowers.
He was listening attentively and trying
to catch the scent, showing that in some
way he was aware of our approach. I
watched his gestures, and tried to make
the most of my opportunity to learn what
I could about him, fearing he would
not stay long. He made a fine picture,
standing alert in the sunny garden walled
in by the most beautiful firs in the world.
	After examining him at leisure, noting
the sharp muzzle thrust inquiringly for-
ward, the long shaggy hair on his broad
chest, the stiff ears nearly buried in hair,
and the slow, heavy way in which he
moved his head, I foolishly made a rush
on him, throwing up my arms and shout-
ing to frighten him, to see him run. He
did not mind the demonstration much;
only pushed his head farther forward,
and looked at me sharply as if asking,
What now? If you want to fight, I in
ready. Then I began to fear that on
me would fall the work of running. But
I was afraid to run, lest he should be
encouraged to pursue me; therefore I
held my ground, staring him in the face
within a dozen yards or so, putting on
as bold a look as I could, and hoping the
influence of the human eye would be as
great as it is said to be. Under these
strained relations the interview seemed
to last a long time. Finally, the bear,
seeing how still I was, calmly withdrew
his huge paws from the log, gave me
a piercing look as if warning me not to
follow him, turned, and walked slowly
up the middle of the meadow into the
forest; stopping every few steps and
looking back to make sure that I was
not trying to take him at a disadvan-
tage in a rear attack. I was glad to
part with him, and greatly enjoyed the
vanishing view as he waded through the
lilies and columbines.</PB>

	Thenceforth I always tried to give
bears respectful notice of my approach,
and they usually kept well out of my
way. Though they often came around
my camp in the night, only once after-
ward, as far as I know, was I very near
one of them in daylight. This time it
was a grizzly I met; and as luck would
have it, I was even nearer to him than I
had been to the big cinnamon. Though
not a large specimen, he seemed forini-
dable enough at a distance of less than a
dozen yards. His shaggy coat was well
grizzled, his head almost white. When
I first caught sight of him he was eat-
ing acorns under a Kellogg oak, at a
distance of perhaps seventy-five yards,
and I tried to slip past without disturb-
ing him. But he had either heard my
steps on the gravel or caught my scent,
for he caine straight toward me, stop-
ping every rod or so to look and listen;
and as I was afraid to be seen running,
I crawled on my hands and knees a little
way to one side and hid behind a libo-
cedrus, hoping he would pass me unno-
ticed. He soon came up opposite me,
and stood looking ahead, while I looked
at him, peering past the bulging trunk
of the tree. At last, turning his head,
he caught sight of mine, stared sharply
a minute or two, and then, with fine dig-
nity, disappeared in a mauzanita - cov-
ered earthquake talus.
	Considering how heavy and broad-
footed bears are, it is wonderful how
little harm they do in the wilderness.
Even in the well-watered gardens of the
middle region, where the flowers grow
tallest, and where during warm weather
the bears wallow and roll, no evidence
of destruction is visible. On the contra-
ry, under natures direction, the massive
beasts act as gardeners. On the forest
floor, carpeted with needles and brush,
and on the tough sod of glacier meadows,
bears make no mark, but around the
sandy margin of lakes their magnificent
tracks form grand lines of embroidery.
Their well-worn trails extend along the
main caiions on either side, and though
dusty in some places make no scar on
the landscape. They bite and break off
the branches of some of the pines and
oaks to get the nuts, but this pinning is
so light that few mountaineers ever no-
tice it; and though they interfere with
the orderly lichen-veiled decay of fallen
trees, tearing them to pieces to reacb the
colonies of ants that inhabit them, the
scattered ruins are quickly pressed back
into harmony by snow and rain and over-
leaning vegetation.
	The number of bears that make the
park their home may be guessed by the
number that have been killed by the
two best hunters, Duncan and old David
Brown. Duncan began to be known as
a bear-killer about the year 1865. He
was then roaming the woods, hunting
and prospecting on the south fork of the
Merced. A friend told me that he
killed his first bear near his cabin at
Wawona; that after mustering courage
to fire he fled, without waiting to learn
the effect of his shot. Going back in a
few hours he found poor Bruin dead,
and gained courage to try again. Dun-
can confessed to me, when we made
an excursion together in 1875, that he
was at first mortally afraid of bears,
but after killing a half dozen be began
to keep count of his victims, and be-
came ambitious to be known as a great
bear-hunter. In nine years lie had killed
forty - nine, keeping count by notches
cut on one of the timbers of his cabin
on the shore of Crescent Lake, near the
south boundary of the park. He said
the more he knew about bears, the more
he respected them and the less he feared
them. But at the same time he grew
more and more cautious, and never fired
until he had every advantage, no matter
how long he had to wait and how far he
had to go before he got the bear just
right as to the direction of the wind, the
distance, and the way of escape in case
of accident; making allowance also for
the character of the animal, old or young,</PB>

cinnamon or grizzly. For old grizzlies,
he said, he had no use whatever, and he
was mighty careful to avoid their ac-
quaintance. He wanted to kill an even
hundred; then he was going to confine
himself to safer game. There was not
much money in bears, anyhow, and a
round hundred was enough for glory.
	I have not seen or heard of him lately,
and do not know how his bloody count
stands. On my excursions, I occasion-
ally passed his cabin. It was full of
meat and skins hung in bundles from
the rafters, and the ground about it was
strewn with bones and hair,  infinitely
less tidy than a bears den. He went
as hunter and guide with a geological
survey party for a year or two, and was
very proud of the scientific knowledge
lie picked up. His admiring fellow
mountaineers, he said, gave him credit
for knowing not only the botanical names
of all the trees and bushes, but also the
botanical names of the bears.
	The most famous hunter of the region
was David Brown, an old pioneer, wh~
early in the gold period established his
main camp in a little forest glade on
the north fork of the Merced, which is
still called Browns Flat. No finer
solitude for a hunter and prospector
could be found; the climate is delight-
ful all the year, and the scenery of
both earth and sky is a perpetual feast.
Though he was not much of a scenery
fellow, his friends say that he knew a
pretty place when he saw it as well as
any one, and liked mightily to get on the
top of a commanding ridge to look off.
	When out of provision, he would take
down his old - fashioned long - barreled
rifle from its deer-horn rest over the fire-
place and set out in search of game.
Seldom did he have to go far for veni-
son, because the deer liked the wood-
ed slopes of Pilot Peak ridge, with its
open spots where they could rest and
look about them, and enjoy the breeze
from the sea in warm weather, free
from troublesome flies, while they found
hiding - places and fine aromatic food
in the deer-brush chaparraL A small,
wise dog was his only companion, and
well the little mountaineer understood
the object of every hunt, whether deer
or bears, or only grouse hidden in the
fir - tops. In deer - hunting Sandy had
little to do, trotting behind his master
as he walked noiselessly through the
fragrant woods, careful not to step hea-
vily on dry twigs, scanning open spots in
the chaparral where the deer feed in the
early morning and toward sunset, peer-
ing over ridges and swells as new out-
looks were reached, and along alder and
willow fringed flats and streams, until
he found a young buck, killed it, tied
its legs together, threw it on his shoul-
der, and so back to camp. But when
bears were hunted, Sandy played an im-
portant part as leader, and several times
saved his masters life; and it was as a
bear-hunter that David Brown became
famous. His method, as I had it from
a friend who had passed many an even-
ing in his cabin listening to his long
stories of adventure, was simply to take
a few pounds of flour and his rifle, and
go slowly and silently over hill and vah
hey in the loneliest part of the wilderness,
until little Sandy came upon the fresh
track of a bear, then follow it to the
death, paying no heed to time. Wher-
ever the bear went he went, however
rough the ground, led by Sandy, who
looked back from time to time to see
how his master was coming on, and reg-
ulated his pace accordingly, never grow~
ing weary or allowing any other track
to divert him. When high ground was
reached a halt was made, to scan the
openings in every direction, and per-
chance Bruin would be discovered sitting
upright on his haunches, eating manza~
nita berries; pulling down the fruit-la-
den branches with his paws and pressing
them together, so as to get substantial
mouthfuhs, however mixed with leaves
and twigs. The time of year enabled
the hunter to determine approximately</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00627" SEQ="0627" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="621">Among the Animals of the Yosemite.	621

where the game would be found: in
spring and early summer, in lush grass
and clover meadows and in berry tangles
along the banks of streams, or on pea-
vine and lupine clad slopes; in late sum
mer and autumn, beneath the pines, eat-
ing the cones cut off by the squirrels, and
in oak groves at the bottom of cafions,
munching acorns, mauzanita berries, and
cherries; and after snow had fallen, in
alluvial bottoms, feeding on ants and
yellow-jacket wasps. These food places
were always cautiously approached, so as
to avoid the chance of sudden encoun-
ters.
	Whenever, said the hunter, I saw
a bear before he saw me, I had no trouble
in killing him. I just took lots of time to
learn what he was up to and how long
he would be likely to stay, and to study
the direction of the wind and the lay of
the land. Then I worked round to lee-
ward of him, no matter how far I had to
go; crawled and dodged to within a hun-
dred yards, near the foot of a tree that I
could climb, but which was too small for
a bear to climb. There I looked well to
the priming of my rifle, took off my boots
so as to climb quickly if necessary, and,
with my rifle in rest and Sandy behind
me, waited until my bear stood right,
when I made a sure, or at least a good
shot back of the fore leg. In case he
showed fight, I got up the tree I had in
mind, before he could reach me. But
bears are slow and awkward with their
eyes, and being to windward they could
not scent me, and often I got in a second
shot before they saw the smoke. Usual-
ly, however, they tried to get away when
they were hurt, and I let them go a good
safe while before I ventured into the
brush after them. Then Sandy was pretty
sure to find them dead; if not, he barked
bold as a lion to draw attention, or rushed
in and nipped them behind, enabling
me to get to a safe distance and watch
a chance for a finishing shot.
	Oh yes, bear-hunting is a mighty in-
teresting business, and safe enough if fol
lowed just right, though, like every other
business, especially the wild kind, it has
its accidents, and Sandy and I have had
close calls at times. Bears are nobodys
fools, and they know enough to let men
alone as a general thing, unless they
are wounded, or cornered, or have cubs.
In my opinion, a hungry old mother
would catch and eat a man, if she could;
which is only fair play, anyhow, for we
eat them. But nobody, as far as I know,
has been eaten up in these rich moun-
tains. Why they never tackle a fellow
when he is lying asleep I never could un-
derstand. They could gobble us mighty
handy, but I suppose it s nature to re-
spect a sleeping man.
	Sheep-owners and their shepherds have
killed a great many bears, mostly by
poison and traps of various sorts. Bears
are fond of mutton, and levy heavy toll
on every flock driven into the mountains.
They usually come to the corral at night,
climb in, kill a sheep with a stroke of
the paw, carry it off a little distance,
eat about half of it, and return the next
night for the other half; and so on all
summer, or until they are themselves
killed. It is not, however, by direct kill-
ing, but by suffocation through crowd-
ing against the corral wall in fright, that
the greatest losses are incurred. From
ten to fifteen sheep are found dead, smo-
thered in the corral, after every attack;
or the walls are broken, and the flock is
scattered far and wide. A flock may
escape the attention of these marauders
for a week or two in the spring; but af-
ter their first taste of the fine mountain-
fed meat the visits are persistently kept
up, in spite of all precautions~ Once I
spent a night with two Portuguese shep-
herds, who were greatly troubled with
bears, from two to four or five visiting
theni almost every night. Their camp
was near the middle of the park, and
the wicked bears, they said, were getting
worse and worse. Not waiting now un-
til dark, they came out of the brush in
broad daylight, and boldly carried off as</PB>

many sheep as they liked. One even-
ing, before sundown, a bear, followed by
two cubs, came for an early supper, as
the flock was being slowly driven toward
camp. Joe, the elder of the shepherds,
warned by many exciting experiences,
promptly climbed a tall tamarack pine,
and left the freebooters to help them-
selves; while Antone, calling him a cow-
ard, and declaring that he was not going
to let bears eat up his sheep before his
face, set the dogs on them, and rushed
toward them with a great noise and a
stick. The frightened cubs ran up a
tree, and the mother ran to meet the
shepherd and dogs. Antone stood as-
tonished for a moment, eying the on-
coming bear; then fled faster than Joe
had, closely pursued. He scrambled to
the roof of their little cabin, the only
refuge quickly available; and fortunate-
ly, the bear, anxious about her young,
did not climb after him,  only held him
in mortal terror a few minutes, glaring
and threatening, then hastened back to
her cubs, called them down, went to the
frightened, huddled flock, killed a sheep,
and feasted in peace. Antone piteous-
ly entreated cautious Joe to show him a
good safe tree, up which he climbed like
a sailor climbing a mast, and held on as
long as he could with legs crossed, the
slim pine recommended by Joe being
nearly branchless. So you too are a
bear coward, as well as Joe, I said,
after hearing th~ story. Oh, I tell
you, he replied, with grand solemnity,
bear face close by look awful; she just
as soon eat me as not. She do so as eef
all my sheeps blong every one to her
own self. I run to bear no more. I
take tree every time.
	After this the shepherds corralled the
flock about an hour before sundown,
chopped large quantities of dry wood and
made a circle of fires around the corral
every night, and one with a gun kept
watch on a stage built in a pine by the
side of the cabin, while the other slept.
But after tbe first night or two this fire
fence did no good, for the robbers seemed
to regard the light as an advantage, af-
ter becoming used to it.
	On the night I spent at their camp
the show made by the wall of fire when
it was blazing in its prime was magni-
ficent: the illumined trees round about
relieved against solid darkness, arid the
two thousand sheep lying down in one
gray mass, sprinkled with gloriously bril-
liant gems, the effect of the firelight in
their eyes. It was nearly midnight when
a pair of the freebooters arrived. They
walked boldly through a gap in the fire
circle, killed two sheep, carried them out,
and vanished in the dark woods, leaving
ten dead in a pile, trampled down and
smothered against the corral fence; while
the scared watcher in the tree did not
fire a single shot,, saying he was afraid
he would hit some of the sheep, as the
bears got among them before he could
get a good sight.
	In the morning I asked the shepherds
why they did not move the flock to a new
pasture. Oh, no use! cried Antone.
Look my dead sheeps. We move three
four time before, all the same bear come
by the track. No use. To-morrow we
go home below. Look my dead sheeps.
Soon all dead.
	Thus were they driven out of the
mountains more than a month before
the usual time. After Uncle Sams sol-
diers, bears are the most effective for-
est police, but some of the shepherds
are very successful in killing them. Al-
together, by hunters, mountaineers, In-
dians, and sheepmen, probably five or
six hundred have been killed within the
bounds of the park, during the last thirty
years. But they are not in danger of
extinction. Now that the park is guard-
ed by soldiers, not only has the vegeta-
tion in great part come back to the de-
solate ground, but all the wild animals
are increasing in numbers. No guns
are allowed in the park except under
certain restrictions, and after a permit
has been obtained from the officer in</PB>

charge. This has stopped the barbarous
slaughter of bears, and especially of deer,
by shepherds, hunters, and hunting tour-
ists, who, it would seem, can find no plea-
sure without blood.
	The Sierra deer  the blacktail 
spend the winters in the brushy and ex-
ceedingly rough region just below the
main timber-belt, and are less accessi-
ble to hunters there than when they are
passing through the comparatively open
forests to and from their summer pas-
tures. near the summits of the range.
They go up the mountains early in the
spring as the snow melts, not waiting for
it all to disappear; reaching the High
Sierra about the first of June, and the
coolest recesses at the base of the peaks
a month or so later. I have tracked
them for miles over compacted snow from
three to ten feet deep.
	Deer are capital mountaineers, making
their way into the heart of the roughest
mountains; seeking not only pasturage,
but a cool climate, and safe hidden places
in which to bring forth their young.
They are not supreme as rock-climbing
animals; they take second rank, yield-
ing the first to the mountain sheep, which
dwell above them on the highest crags
and peaks. Still, the two meet frequent-
ly; for the deer climbs all the peaks
save the lofty summits above the glaciers,
crossing piles of angular boulders, roaring
swollen streams, and sheer-walled cafions
by fords and passes that would try the
nerves of the hardiest mountaineers, 
climbing with graceful ease and reserve
of strength that cannot fail to arouse ad-
miration. Everywhere some species of
deer seems to be at home, on rough or
smooth ground, lowlands or highlands,
in swamps and barrens and the densest
woods, in varying climates, hot or cold,
over all the continent; maintaining glo-
rious health, never making an awkward
step. Standing, lying down, walking,
feeding, running even for life, it is al-
ways invincibly graceful, and adds beau-
ty and animation to every landscape, 
a charming animal, and a great credit to
nature.
	I never see one of the common black-
tail deer, the only species in the park,
without fresh admiration; and since I
never carry a gumi I see them well: lying
beneath a juniper or dwarf pine, among
the brown needles on the brink of some
cliff or the end of a ridge commanding
a wide outlook; feeding in sunny open-
ings among chaparral, daintily selecting
aromatic leaves and twigs ; leading their
fawns out of my way, or making them
lie down and hide; bounding past through
the forest, or curiously advancing and
retreating again and again.
	One morning when I was eating break-
fast in a little garden spot on the Kaweah,
hedged around with chaparral, I noticed
a deers head thrust through the bushes,
the big beautiful eyes gazing at me. I
kept still, and the deer ventured forward
a step, then snorted and withdrew. In
a few minutes she returned, and came
into the open garden, stepping with infi-
nite grace, followed by two others. Af-
ter showing themselves for a moment,
they bounded over the hedge with sharp,
timid snorts and vanished. But curios-
ity brought them back with still another,
and all four came into my garden, and,
satisfied that I meant them no ill, began
to feed, actually eating breakfast with
me, like tame, gentle sheep around a
shepherd,  rare company, and the most
graceful in movements and attitudes.
I eagerly watched them while they fed
on ceanothus and wild cherry, daintily
culling single leaves here and there from
the side of the hedge, turning now and
then to snip a few leaves of mint from
the midst of the garden flowers. Grass
they did not eat at all. No wonder the
contents of the deers stomach are eaten
by the Indians.
	While exploring the upper cafion of
the north fork of the San Joaquin, one
evening, the sky threatening rain, I
searched for a dry bed, and made choice
of a big juniper that had been pushed</PB>

down by a snow avalanche, but was rest-
ing stubbornly on its knees high enough
to let me lie under its broad trunk. Just
below my shelter there was another juni-
per on the very brink of a precipice, and,
examining it, I found a deer-bed beneath
it, completely protected and concealed by
drooping branches,  a fine refuge and
lookout as well as resting-place. About
an hour before dark I heard the clear,
sharp snorting of a deer, and looking
down on the brushy, rocky ca?ion bottom
discovered an anxious doe that no doubt
had her fawns concealed near by. She
bounded over the chaparral and up the
farther slope of the wall, often stopping
to look back and listen,  a fine picture
of vivid, eager alertness. I sat perfect-
ly still, and as my shirt was colored like
the juniper bark I was not easily seen.
After a little she came cautiously toward
me, sniffing the air and gazing, and her
movements, as she descended the cafion
side over boulder piles and brush and
fallen timber, were admirably strong and
beautiful; she never strained or made
apparent efforts, although jumping high
here and there. As she drew nigh she
sniffed anxiously, trying the air in differ-
ent directions until she caught my scent;
then bounded off, and vanished behind a
small grove of firs. Soon she came back
with the same caution and insatiable cu-
riosity,  coming and going five or six
times. While I sat admiring her, a
Douglas squirrel, evidently excited by
her noisy alarms, climbed a boulder be-
neath me, and witnessed her perform-
ances as attentively as I did, while a
frisky chipmunk, too restless or hungry
for such shows, busied himself about his
supper in a thicket of shadbushes, the
fruit of which was then ripe, glancing
about on the slender twigs lightly as a
sparrow.
	Toward the end of the Indian summer,
when the young are strong, the deer be-
gin to gather in little bands of from six
to fifteen or twenty, and on the approach
of the first snowstorm they set out on
their march down the mountains to their
winter quarters; lingering usually on
warm hillsides and spurs eight or ten
miles below the summits, as if loath to
leave. About the end of November, a
heavy, far - reaching storm drives them
down in haste along the dividing ridges
between the rivers, led by old experi-
enced buc~ks whose knowledge of the to-
pography is wonderful.
	It is when the deer are coming down
that the Indians set out on their grand
fall hunt. Too lazy to go into the re-
cesses of the mountains away from trails,
they wait for the deer to come out, and
then waylay them. This plaii also has
the advantage of finding them in bands.
Great preparations are made. Old guns
are mended, bullets moulded, and the
hunters wash themselves and fast to some
extent, to insure good luck, as they say.
Men and women, old and young, set
forth together. Central camps are made
on the well-known highways of the deer,
which are soon red with blood. Each
hunter comes in laden, old crones as well
as maidens smiling on the luckiest. All
grow fat and merry. Boys, each armed
with an antlered head, play at buck-fight-
ing, and plague the industrious women,
who are busily preparing the meat for
transportation, by stealing up behind
them and throwing fresh hides over
them. But the Indians are passing away
here as everywhere, and their red camps
on the mountains are fewer every year.
	There are panthers, foxes, badgers,
porcupines, and coyotes in the park, but
not in large numbers. I have seen coy-
otes well back in the range at the head
of the Tuolumne Meadows as early as
June 1st, before the snow was gone,
feeding on marmots; but they are far
more numerous on the inhabited low-
lands around ranches, where they en-
joy life on chickens, turkeys, quail eggs,
ground squirrels, hares, etc., and all kinds
of fruit. Few wild sheep, I fear, are
left hereabouts; for, though safe on the
high peaks, they are driven down the</PB>

eastern slope of the niountains when the
deer are driven down the western, to
ridges and outlying spurs where the
snow does not fall to a great depth, and
there they are within reach of the cat-
tlemens rifles.
	The two squirrels of the park, the
Douglas and the California gray, keep
all the woods lively. The former is far
more abundant and more widely distrib-
uted, being found all the way up from
the foothills to the dwarf pines on the
summit peaks. He is the most influen-
tial of the Sierra animals, though small,
and the brightest of all the squirrels I
know,  a squirrel of squirrels, quick
mountain vigor and valor condensed,
purely wild, and as free from disease as
a sunbeam. One cannot think of such
an animal ever being weary or sick. He
claims all the woods, and is inclined to
drive away even men as intruders. How
he scolds, and what faces he makes! If
not so comically small, he would be a
dreadful fellow. The gray, Sciurus fos-
sor, is the handsomest, I think, of all the
large American squirrels. He is some-
thing like the Eastern gray, but is
brighter and clearer in color, and more
lithe and slender. He dwells in the oak
and pine woods up to a height of about
five thousand feet above the sea, is rather
common in Yosemite Valley, Hetch-
Hetchy, Kings River Caffon, and indeed
in all the main cafions and Yosemites,
but does not like the high fir-covered
ridges. Compared with the Douglas,
the gray is more than twice as large;
nevertheless, he manages to make his
way through the trees with less stir than
his small, peppery neighbor, and is much
less influential in every way. In the
spring, before pine-nuts and hazel-nuts
are ripe, he examines last years cones
for the few seeds that may be left in
them between the half-open scales, and
gleans fallen nuts and seeds on the
ground among the leaves, after making
sure that no enemy is nigh. His fine
tail floats, now behind, now above him,
	VOL. LXXXII.  NO. 493.	40
level or gracefully curled, light and ra-
diant as dry thistledown. His body
seems hardly more substantial than his
tail. The Douglas is a firm, emphatic
bolt of life, fiery, pungent, full of brag
and show and fight, and his movements
have none of the elegant deliberation of
the gray. They are so quick and keen
they almost sting the onlooker, and the
acrobatic harlequin gyrating show he
makes of himself turns one giddy to see.
The gray is shy and oftentimes stealthy,
as if half expecting to find an enemy in
every tree and bush and behind every
log; he seems to wish to be let alone,
and manifests no desire to be seen, or
admired, or feared. He is hunted by the
Indians, arid this of itself is cause enough
for caution. The Douglas is less attrac-
tive as game, and is probably increasing
in numbers in spite of every enemy. He
goes his ways bold as a lion, up and down
and across, round and round, the happi-
est, merriest, of all the hairy tribe, and
at the same time tremendously earnest
and solemn, sunshine incarnate, making
every tree tingle with his electric toes.
If you prick him, you cannot think he
will bleed. He seems above the chance
and change that beset common mortals,
though in busily gathering burs and
nuts he shows that he has to work for a
living, like the rest of us. I never found
a dead Douglas. He gets into the world
and out of it without being noticed;
only in prime is he seen, like some lit-
tle plants that are visible only when in
bloom.
	The Townsend tamias, a plump, slow,
sober, well-dressed chipmunk, nearly as
large as the Douglas squirrel, may occa-
sionally be seen about the roots of the firs
or fallen trunks, solemnly staring as if
he never had anything to do. The little
striped species, 1. quadrivittatus, is
more interesting and a hundred times
more numerous than the Townsend. A
brighter, cheerier chipmunk does not ex-
ist. He is smarter, more arboreal and
squirrel-like, than the familiar Eastern</PB>

species, and is distributed as widely on
the Sierra as the Douglas. Every for-
est however dense or open, every hilltop
and caflon however brushy or bare, is
cheered and enlivened by this happy lit-
tle animal. You are likely to notice him
first on the lower edge of the coniferous
belt, where the sabine and yellow pines
meet; and thence upward, go where you
may, you will find him every day, even
in winter, unless the weather is stormy.
He is an exceedingly interesting little
fellow, full of odd, quaint ways, confid-
ing, thinking no evil; and without be-
ing a squirrel  a true shadow - tail 
he lives the life of a squirrel, and has
almost all squirrelish accomplishments
without aggressive quarrelsomeness.
	I never weary of watching him as he
frisks about in the bushes, gathering
seeds and berries; poising on slender
twigs of wild cherry, shad, chinquapin,
buckthorn bramble; skimming along
prostrate trunks or over the grassy, nee-
dle - strewn forest floor; darting from
boulder to boulder on glacial pavements
and the tops of the great domes. When
the seeds of the conifers are ripe, he
climbs the trees and cuts off the cones
for a winter store, working diligently,
though not with the tremendous lightning
energy of the Douglas, who frequently
drives him out of the best trees. Then
he lies in wait, and picks up a share of
the burs cut off by his domineering
cousin, and stores them beneath logs
and in hollows. Few of the Sierra an-
imals are so well liked as this little airy,
fluffy half squirrel, half spermophile.
So gentle, confiding, and busily cheery
and happy, he takes ones heart and
keeps his place among the best loved of
the mountain darlings. A diligent col-
lector of seeds, nuts, and berries, of
course he is well fed, though never in
the least dumpy with fat. On the con-
trary, he looks like a mere fluff of fur,
weighing but little more than a field
mouse, and of his frisky, birdlike live-
liness without haste there is no end.
Douglas can bark with his mouth closed,
but little quad always opens his when
he talks or sings. He has a consider-
able variety of notes which correspond
with his movements, some of them sweet
and liquid, like water dripping into a
pool with tinkling sound. His eyes are
black and animated, shining like dew.
He seems dearly to like teasing a dog,
venturing within a few feet of it, then
frisking away with a lively chipping and
low squirrelish churring; beating time
to his music, such as it is, with his tail,
which at each chip and churr describes a
half circle. Not even Douglas is surer-
footed or takes greater risks. I have
seen him running about on sheer Yose-
mite cliffs, holding on with as little ef-
fort as a fly and as little thought of
danger in places where, if he had made
the least slip, he would have fallen thou-
sands of feet. How fine it would be
could mountaineers move about on pre-
cipices with the same sure grip!
	Before the pine - nuts are ripe, grass
seeds and those of the many species of
ceanothus, with strawberries, raspber-
ries, and the soft red thimbleberries of
Rubn~s nutkanus, form the bulk of his
food, and a neater eater is not to be
found in the mountains. Bees powdered
with pollen, poking their blunt noses into
the bells of flowers, are comparatively
clumsy and boorish. Frisking along
some fallen pine or fir, when the grass
seeds are ripe, he looks about him, con-
sidering which of the tufts he sees is
likely to have the best, runs out to it, se-
lects what he thinks is sure to be a good
head, cuts it off, carries it to the top of
the log, sits upright and nibbles out the
grain without getting awns in his mouth,
turning the head round, holding it and
fingering it as if playing on a flute; then
skips for another and another, bringing
them to the same dining-log.
The woodchuck  Arctomys monax 
dwells on high bleak ridges and boulder
piles; and a very different sort of moun-
taineer is he,  bulky, fat, aldermanic.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00633" SEQ="0633" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="627">Among the Animals of the Yosemite.	627
and fairly bloated at times by hearty in-
dulgence in the lush pastures of his airy
home. And yet he is by no means a
dull animal. In the midst of what we
regard as storm-beaten desolation, high
in the frosty air, beside the glaciers, he
pipes and whistles right cheerily, and
lives to a good old age. If you are as
early a riser as he is, you may oftentimes
see him come blinking out of his bur-
row to meet the first beams of the morn-
ing and take a sunbath on some favorite
flat-topped boulder. Afterward, well
warmed, he goes to breakfast in one of
his garden hollows, eats heartily like a
cow in clover until comfortably swollen,
then goes a-visiting, and plays and loves
and fights.
	In the spring of 1875, when I was
exploring the peaks and glaciers about
the head of the middle fork of the San
Joaquin, I had crossed the range from
the head of Owen River, and one morn-
ing, passing around a frozen lake where
the snow was perhaps ten feet deep, I
was surprised to find the fresh track of
a woodchuck plainly marked, the sun
having softened the surface. What
could the animal be thinking of, coming
out so early while all the ground was
snow-buried? The steady trend of his
track showed he had a definite aim, and
fortunately it was toward a mountain
thirteen thousand feet high that I meant
to climb. So I followed to see if I could
find out what he was up to. From the
base of the mountain the track pointed
straight up, and I knew by the melting
snow that I was not far behind him.
I lost the track on a crumbling ridge,
partly projecting through the snow, but
soon discovered it again. Well toward
the summit of the mountain, in an open
spot on the south side, nearly inclosed
by disintegrating pinnacles among which
the sun heat reverberated, making an
isolated patch of warm climate, I found
a nice garden, full of rock cress, phlox,
silene, draba, etc., and a few grasses;
and in this garden I overtook the wan-
derer, enjoying a fine fresh meal, per.
haps the first of the season. How did
he know the way to this one garden spot,
so high and far off, and what told him
that it was in bloom while yet the snow
was ten feet deep over his den? For
this it would seem he would need more
botanical, topographical, and climatolo-
gical knowledge than most mountaineers
are possessed of.
	The shy, curious mountain beaver 
Haplodon  lives on the heights, not far
from the woodchuck. He digs canals
and controls the flow of small streams
under the sod, cuts large quantities of
grass, lupines, and other plants, lays
them out in neat piles with the stems all
one way to dry, like hay, and stores
them in underground chambers. These
hayfields on the mountain tops, showing
busy, thoughtful life where one deemed
himself alone, are startling. And it is
startling, too, when one is camped on
the edge of a sloping meadow near the
homes of these industrious mountaineers,
to be awakened in the still night by the
sound of water rushing and gurgling un-
der ones head in a newly formed canal.
Pouched gophers also have a way of
awakening nervous campers that is quite
as exciting as the haplodons plan; that
is, by a series of firm upward pushes
when they are driving tunnels and shov-
ing up the dirt. One naturally cries
out, Who s there? and then discover-
ing the cause, All right. Go on. Good-
night, and goes to sleep again.
	The wood rat  Neotoma  is one of
the most interesting of the Sierra ani-
mals. He is scarcely at all like the
common rat, is nearly twice as large,
has a delicate soft fur of a bluish slate
color, white on the belly, large ears thin
and translucent, eyes full and liquid and
mild in expression, nose blunt and squir-
relish, slender claws sharp as needles,
and as his limbs are strong he can climb
about as well as a squirrel; while no rat
or squirrel has so innocent a look, is
so easily approached, or in general ex</PB>

presses so much confidence iii one~ s good
intentions. He seems too fine for the
thorny thickets he inhabits, and his big,
rough hut is as unlike himself as pos-
sible. No other animal in these moun-
tains makes nests so large and striking
in appearance as his. They are built of
all kinds of sticks (broken branches, and
old rotten moss-grown chunks, and green
twigs, smooth or thorny, cut from the
nearest bushes), mixed with miscellane-
ous rubbish and curious odds and ends,
 bits of cloddy earth, stones, bones,
bits of deer-horn, etc.: the whole sun-
ply piled in conical masses on the ground
in chaparral thickets. Some of these
cabins are five or six feet high, and oc-
casionally a dozen or more are grouped
together; less, perhaps, for societys sake
than for advantages of food and shelter.
	Coming through deep, stiff chaparral
in the heart of the wilderness, heated
and weary in forcing a way, the solitary
explorer, happening into one of these cu-
rious neotoma villages, is startled at the
strange sight, and may imagine he is in
an Indian village, and feel anxious as to
the reception he will get in a place so
wild. At first, perhaps, not a single in-
habitant will be seen, or at most only two
or three seated on the tops of their huts
as at the doors, observing the stranger
with the mildest of mild eyes. The nest
in the centre of the cabin is made of grass
and films of bark chewed to tow, and
lined with feathers and the down of vari-
ous seeds. The thick, rough walls seem
to be built for defense against enemies
 fox, coyote, etc.  as well as for shel-
ter, and the delicate creatures, in their
big, rude homes, suggest tender flowers,
like those of Salzia carduacea, defended
by thorny involucres.
	Sometimes the home is built in the
forks of an oak, twenty or thirty feet
from the ground, and even in garrets.
Among housekeepers who have these
bushmen as neighbors or guests they are
regarded as thieves, because they carry
away and pile together everything trans
portable (knives, forks, tin cups, spoons,
spectacles, combs, nails, kindling-wood,
etc., as well as eatables of all sorts), to
strengthen their fortifications or to shine
among rivals. Once, far back in the
High Sierra, they stole my snow - gog-
gles, the lid of my teapot, and my ane-
roid barometer; and one stormy night,
when encamped under a prostrate cedar,
I was awakened by a gritting sound on
the granite, and by the light of my fire
I discovered a handsome neotoma beside
me, dragging away my ice-hatchet, pull-
ing with might and main by a buckskin
string on the handle. I threw bits of
bark at him and made a noise to frighten
him, but he stood scolding and chattering
back at me, his fine eyes shining with an
air of injured innocence.
	A great variety of lizards enliven the
warm portions of the park. Some of
them are more than a foot in length,
others but little larger than grasshop-
per~. A few are snaky and repulsive
at first sight, but most of the species are
handsome and attractive, and bear ac-
quaintance well; we like them better the
farther we see into their charming lives.
Small fellow mortals, gentle and guile-
less, they are easily tamed, and have
beautiful eyes, expressing the clearest in-
nocence, so that, in spite of prejudices
brought from cool, lizardless countries,
one must soon learn to like them. Even
the horned toad of the plains and foot-
hills, called horrid, is mild and gentle,
with charming eyes, and so are the snake-
like species found in the underbrush
of the lower forests. These glide in
curves with all the ease and grace of
snakes, while their small, undeveloped
limbs drag for the most part as useless
appendages. One specimen that I mea-
sured was fourteen inches long, and as
far as I saw it made no use whatever of
its diminutive limbs.
	Most of them glint and dart on the
sunny rocks and across open spaces from
bush to bush, swift as dragonflies and
humming-birds, and about as brilliantly</PB>

colored. They never make a long-sus-
tained run, whatever their object, but
dart direct as arrows for a distance of
ten or twenty feet, then suddenly stop,
and as suddenly start again. These
stops are necessary as rests, for they are
short-winded, and when pursued steadily
are soon run out of breath, pant pitifully,
and may easily be caught where no re-
treat in bush or rock is quickly available.
	If you stay with them a week or two
and behave well, these gentle saurians,
descendants of an ancient race of giants,
will soon know and trust you, come to
your feet, play, and watch your every
motion with cunning curiosity. You
will surely learn to like them, not only
the bright ones, gorgeous as the rainbow,
but the little ones, gray as lichened gran-
ite, and scarcely bigger than grasshop-
pers; and they will teach you that scales
may cover as fine a nature as hair or
feathers or anything tailored.
	There are many snakes in the caftons
and lower forests, but they are mostly
handsome and harmless. Of all the
tourists and travelers who have visited
Yosemite and the adjacent mountains,
not one has been bitten by a snake of
any sort, while thousands have been
charmed by them. Some of them vie
with the lizards in beauty of color and
dress patterns. Only the rattlesnake is
venomous, and he carefully keeps his
venom to himself as far as man is con-
cerned, unless his life is threatened.
	Before I learned to respect rattlesnakes
I killed two, the first on the San Joa-
quin plain. He was coiled comfortably
around a tuft of bunch-grass, and I dis-
covered him when he was between my
feet as I was stepping over him. He
held his head down and did not attempt
to strike, although in danger of being
trampled. At that time, thirty years
ago, I imagined that rattlesnakes should
be killed wherever found. I had no
weapon of any sort, and on the smooth
plain there was not a stick or a stone
within miles; so I crushed him by jump-
ing on him, as the deer are said to do.
Looking me in the face he saw I meant
mischief, and quickly cast himself into a
coil, ready to strike in defense. I knew
he could not strike when traveling, there-
fore I threw handfuls of dirt and grass
sods at him, to tease him out of coil. He
held his ground a few minutes, threat-
ening and striking, and then started off
to get rid of me. I ran forward and
jumped on him; but he drew back his
head so quickly my heel missed, and he
also missed his stroke at me. Perse-
cuted, tormented, again and again he
tried to get away, bravely striking out
to protect himself; but at last my heel
came squarely down, sorely wounding
him, and a few more brutal stampings
crushed him. I felt degraded by the
killing business, farther from heaven,
and I made up my mind to try to be at
least as fair and charitable as the snakes
themselves, and to kill no more save in
self-defense.
	The second killing might also, I think,
have been avoided, and I have always
felt somewhat sore and guilty about it.
I had built a little cabin in Yosemite,
and for convenience in getting water,
and for the sake of music and society,
I led a small stream from Yosemite
Creek into it. Running along the side
of the wall it was not in the way, and
it had just fall enough to ripple and sing
in low, sweet tones, making delightful
company, especially at night when I was
lying awake. Then a few frogs caine
in and made merry with the stream,
 and one snake, I suppose to catch
the frogs.
	Returning from my long walks, I usu-
ally brought home a large handful of
plants, partly for study, partly for orna-
meat, and set them in a corner of the
cabin, with their stems in the stream to
keep them fresh. One day, when I
picked up a handful that had begun to
fade, I uncovered a large coiled rattler
that had been hiding behind the flowers.
Thus suddenly brought to light face to</PB>

face with the rightful owner of the
place, the poor reptile was desperately
embarrassed, evidently realizing that he
had no right in the cabin. It was not
only fear that he showed, but a good
deal of downright bashfulness and em-
barrassment, like that of a more than
half honest person caught under suspi-
cious circumstances behind a door. In-
stead of striking or threatening to strike,
though coiled and ready, he slowly drew
his head down as far as he could, with
awkward, confused kinks in his neck and
a shamefaced expression, as if wishing
the ground would open and hide him.
I have looked into the eyes of so many
wild animals that I feel sure I did not
mistake the feelings of this unfortunate
snake. I did not want to kill him, but
I had many visitors, some of them chil-
dren, and I oftentimes came in late at
night; so I judged he must die.
	Since then I have seen perhaps a hun-
dred or more in these mountains, but I
have never intentionally disturbed them,
nor have they disturbed me to any great
extent, even by accident, though in dan-
ger of being stepped on. Once, while
I was on my knees kindling a fire, one
glided under the arch made by my arm.
He was only going away from the ground
I had selected for a camp, and there was
not the slightest danger, because I kept
still and allowed him to go in peace.
The only time I felt myself in serious
danger was when I was coming out of the
Tuolumne Cafion by a steep side caiion
toward the head of Yosemite Creek. On
an earthquake talus, a boulder in my way
presented a front so high that I could just
reach the upper edge of it while standing
on the next below it. Drawing myself
up, as soon as my head was above the flat
top of it I caught sight of a coiled rattler.
My hands had alarmed him, and he was
rea(ly for me; but even with this provo-
cation, and when my head came in sight
within a foot of him, he did not strike.
The last time I sauntered through the
big cafion I saw about two a day. One
was not coiled, but neatly folded in a
narrow space between two cobblestones
on the side of the river, his head below
the level of them, ready to shoot up like
a Jack-in-the-box for frogs or birds.
My foot spanned the space above within
an inch or two of his head, but he only
held it lower. In making my way
through a particularly tedious tangle of
buckthorn, I parted the branches on the
side of an open spot and threw my bun-
dle of bread into it; and when, with my
arms free, I was pushing through after
it, I saw a small rattlesnake dragging his
tail from beneath my bundle. When he
caught sight of me he eyed me angrily,
and with an air of righteous indignation
seemed to be asking why I had thrown
that stuff on him. He was so small that
I was inclined to slight him, but he
struck out so angrily that I drew back,
and approached the opening from the
other side. But he had been listening,
and when I looked through the brush I
found him confronting me, still with a
come-in-if-you-dare expression. In vain
I tried to explain that I only wanted my
bread; he stoutly held the ground in
front of it; so I went back a dozen rods
and kept still for half an hour, and when
I returned he had gone.
	One evening, near sundown, in a very
rough, boulder-choked portion of the
caiion, I searched long for a level spot
for a bed, and at last was glad to find a
patch of flood-sand on the river-bank,
and a lot of driftwood close by for a
camp-fire. But when I threw down my
bundle, I found two snakes in possession
of the ground. I might have passed the
night even in this snake den without
danger, for I never knew a single in-
stance of their coming into camp in the
night; but fearing that, in so small a
space, some late comers, not aware of
my presence, might get stepped on, when
I was replenishing the fire, to avoid pos-
sible crowding I encamped on one of the
earthquake boulders.
	There are two species of Grotalus in</PB>

the park, and when I was exploring the
basin of Yosemite Creek I thought I had
discovered a new one. I saw a snake
with curious divided appendages on its
head. Going nearer, I found that the
strange headgear was only the feet of a
frog. Cutting a switch I struck the snake
lightly until he disgorged the poor frog,
or rather allowed it to back out. On its
return to the light from one of the very
darkest of death valleys, it blinked a
moment with a sort of dazed look, then
plunged into a stream, apparently happy
and well.
	Frogs abound in all the bogs, marshes,
pools, and lakes, however cold and high
and isolated. How did they manage
to get up these high mountains? Sure-
ly not by jumping. Long and dry ex-
cursions through weary miles of boul-
ders and brush would be trying to frogs.
Most likely their stringy spawn is car-
ried on the feet of ducks, cranes, and
other waterbirds. Anyhow, they are
most thoroughly distributed, and flour-
ish famously. What a cheery, hearty
set they are, and how bravely their krink
and tronk concerts enliven the rocky
wilderness!
	None of the high - lying mountain
lakes or branches of the rivers above
sheer falls had fish of any sort until
stocked by the agency of man. In the
High Sierra, the only river in which
trout exist naturally is the middle fork
of Kings River. There are no sheer
falls on this stream; some of the rapids,
however, are so swift and rough, even
at the lowest stage of water, that it is
surprising any fish can climb them. I
found trout in abundance in this fork
up to seventy-five hundred feet. They
also run quite high on the Kern. On
the Merced they get no higher than Yo-
semite Valley, four thousand feet, all
the forks of the river being barred there
by sheer falls, and on the main Tuolumne
they are stopped by a fall below Hetch-
Hetchy, still lower than Yosemite.
Though these upper waters are inacces-
sible to the fish, one would suppose their
eggs might have been planted there by
some means. Nature has so many ways
of doing such things. In this case she
waited for the agency of man, and now
many of these hitherto fishless lakes and
streams are full of fine trout, stocked
by individual enterprise, Walton clubs,
etc., in great part under the auspices
of the United States Fish Commission.
A few trout carried into Hetch-Hetchy
iii a common water-bucket have multi-
plied wonderfully fast. Lake Tenaya,
at an elevation of over eight thousand
feet, was stocked eight years ago by Mr.
Murphy, who carried a few trout from
Yosemite. Many of the small streams of
the eastern slope have also been stocked
with trout transported over the passes in
tin cans on the backs of mules. Soon, it
would seem, all the streams of the range
will be enriched by these lively fish,
and will become the means of drawing
thousands of visitors into the mountains.
Catching trout with a bit of bent wire is
a rather trivial business, but fortunately
people fish better than they know. In
most cases it is the man who is caught.
Trout-fishing regarded as bait for catch-
ing men, for the saving of both body
and soul, is important, and deserves all
the expense and care bestowed on it.

		PSYCHOLOGY AND ART.

	COMMON sense, which is to-day, as it
has been since eternity, merely the trivi-
alized edition of the scientific results of
the day before yesterday, is just now on
the psychological track. The scientists
felt some years ago that the psycholo-
gical aspect of the products of civiliza-

	This pseudo-philosophical movement,
which takes the standpoint of the psy-
chologist wrongly as a philosophical

found perhaps nowhere else so little or-

ing-teachers supply to the masses. Who-
ever has attended their meetings or ex-
amined the exhibitions of schoolroom
work knows that they do not lack en-
thusiasm and industry, and that their
importance in the educational system
grows rapidly. But they are primary
teachers, and primary teachers are men
who adore nothing more than recently
patented theories which appeal to com-
mon sense; to-day they really feast on
psychology. The greater the influence,
the more dangerous every wrolig step on
the theoretical line, the more necessary
a sober inquiry as to how far all this talk
about psychology and art really covers
the ground.
	We raise thus the question, what psy-
chology and art have to do with each
other, in its most general form, at first
without any relation to the practical pro-
blems. If we acknowledge the question
in such an unlimited form, we cannot
avoid asking, as a preamble to the discus-
sion, whether the work of art cannot be
itself a manual of psychology; whether,
especially, the poet ought not to teach us
psychology. We all have heard often
that Shakespeare and Byron, Meredith
and Kipling, are better psychologists
than any scholar on the academic plat-
form, or that Henry James has written
even more volumes on psychology than
his brother William. That is a misun-
derstanding. The poet, so far as he
works with poetic tools, is never a psycho-
logist; if modern novelists of a special
type sometimes introduce psychological
analysis, they make use of means which
do not belong to pure art; it is a mixed
style which characterizes decadence.
	It is true that discussion would be
meaningless if we were ready to call
every utterance which has to do with
mental life psychology. Psychology
does not demand abstract scientific
forms; it may be offered in literary
forms, yet it means always a special
kind of treatment of mental life. It
tries to describe and to explain mental
life as a combination of elements. The
dissolution of the unity of consciousness
into elementary processes characterizes
psychology, just as natural science de-
mands the dissection of physical objects;
the appreciation of a physical object as
a whole is never natural science, and the
interpretation and suggestion of a men-
tal state as a whole is never psychology.
The poet, as well as the historian and
the man of practical life, has this inter-
pretation of the whole as his aim; the
psychologist goes exactly the opposite
way. They ask about the meaning, the
psychologist about the constitution; and
the psychological elements concern the
poet as little as the microscopical cells
of the tree interest the landscape paint-
er. The tree in the painting ought, in-
deed, to be botanically correct; it ought
not to appear contradictory of the re-
sults of the botanists observations, but
these results themselves need not appear
in the painting. In the same way, we
demand that the poet create men who
are psychologically correct,  at least
in those cases in which higher a~sthetical
laws do not demand the psychological
impossibilities of fairyland, which are
allowed like the botanical impossibilities
of conventionalized flowers or the ana-
tomical impossibilities of human figures
with wings. We detest the psychologi-
cally absurd creations of the stage vil-
lain and the stage hero in the third-class
melodrama, the psychological mario-
nettes of newspaper novels, and the fre-
quent cases of insanity in poor fiction, for
which the schooled psychologist would
make at once the diagnosis that there
must be simulation in them, as the insane
never act so. We demand this psycho-
logical correctness, and the great poet
satisfies it instinctively so fully that the
psychologist may acknowledge the crea-
tions of poetry as substitutional material
for the psychical study of the living man.
The psychologist believes the poet, and
studies jealousy from Othello, and love
from Romeo, and neurasthenia from</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00640" SEQ="0640" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="634">	634	Psychology and Art.
Hamlet, and political emotions from
Ci~sar; but the creation of such lifelike
men is in itself in no way psychology.
	The poet creates mental life in sug-
gesting it to the soul of the reader;
only the man who decomposes it after-
ward is a psychologist. The poet works
as life works; the child who smiles and
weeps causes us to think of pleasure and
pain too, but it offers us no psychologi-
cal understanding of pleasure and pain.
Just so the poet smiles and weeps, and
if he is a great artist, with strong sug-
gestive power, he forces our minds to
feel with hini, while we have only an in-
tellectual interest if he merely analyzes
the emotions and gives us a handful of
elements determined by abstract psycho-
logical conceptions. Popular language
calls a poet a good psychologist if he
creates men who offer a manifold mate-
rial for the analysis of the psychologist;
when the poet begins to make that ana-
lysis himself, and to explain with the
categories of physiological psychology
why the hero became a dreamer, and the
dreamer a hero, and the saint a sinner,
he will hinder his scientific effort by the
desire to be a poet, and will weaken
his poetry by his instructive side show.
Meredith and Bourget do it, Ibsen never.
Poetry and psychology are different, not
because they speak a different language,
but because they take an absolutely dif-
ferent attitude toward the mental life;
the wisdom of the poet about the human
soul does not belong in a handbook of
psychology. For music and the visible
arts the whole question does not exist,
or at least ought not to exist. A side
branch of it, nevertheless, continues to
grow in the old discussion whether mu-
sic ought to describe the human feel-
ings. The confusion about the logical
meaning of description lies here more
on time surface; by principle the case is
the same as in poetry. The composer
describes the emotions as little as the
poet does ; tones and verses suggest the
feelings, while it is an unmusical, un
poetical business to psychologize about
them; but just that is our aim, if we
consider the preamble as closed, and ask
once more what art has to do with psy-
chology. We have seen so far that art
is not by itself psychology; the remain-
ing question, in which all centres, is, then,
how far art can become an object of psy-
chology.
	The situation is simple. Psychology
is the science which describes and ex-
plains the mental processes. A physical
thing or process, even a brain action, is
never, therefore, an immediate object of
psychology. Every work of art  the
pencil drawing and the written poem, the
played melody and the sculptured statue
 exists as a physical thing; hence the
work of art itself is never an object of
psychology, and the description of it lies
outside of the psychologists province.
The physicist describes the tone waves
of a melody; the geometrician describes
the lines and curves and angles of a
drawing. The physical object is in con-
tact with the human mind at two points:
at its start and its goal. Every work of
art springs from the mind of the artist,
and reaches the mind of the public;
its origin and its effect are both psy-
chical processes, and both are material
for the description and explanation of
the psychologist. Two groups of psy-
chological problems are thus offered, 
two points of view for the psychological
study of art; a third one cannot exist.
The one asks, By what psychological pro-
cesses does the mind create art? The
other asks, By what psychological pro-
cesses does the mind enjoy art?
	Modern psychology has attained to its
rapid progress of late years through the
wonderful development of its methods;
it does not believe any more that one
way alone brings us to the goal; we have
to adapt the methods to the problem. It
is quite clear that these two mesthetical
psychological problems demand different
methods. The question how the artist
creates art lies beyond the self-observa</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00641" SEQ="0641" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="635">	Psychology and Art.	635

tion of the psychologist; he must go
back to the past. The question how the
work of art influences the enjoying spec-
tator can be studied by an analysis of
his own iesthetical emotions. In the in-
terest of this self-observing analysis he
may introduce experimental methods, but
he cannot make experiments with the
artistic production. On the other hand,
the artistic creative functions may easily
be followed up toward the art of the
child, of the primitive races, even of the
animals. And so the first group of in-
vestigations makes use chiefly of the so-
ciological, biological, and historical meth~
ods of psychology; the second group
favors the experimental methods. The
larger material is at the disposal of the
first group; the more exact treatment,
characterizes the second. We cannot
sketch the results here even in the most
superficial outlines; we can recall only
the most general directions which these
studies have taken.
	First, the psychology of the art-creat-
ing process. The ~sthetical psychologist,
in our days of Darwinism, goes back to
the play of animals. Biologically this
is easily understood; the frequent play-
ful contests are a most valuable training
for action,  as necessary, therefore, for
the organism in the struggle for existence
as is any other function of the nervous
system, and yet they contain the most
important elements of iesthetic creation:
they are actions which are useless for
the present state of the organism, car-
ried out for enjoyment only. Social
psychology finds the more complicated
forms of the same impulses in the life
of savages. We see how the primitive
races accompany their work by rhyth-
mical songs, how their dances stir up
lyrical poetry, how their tools and ves-
sels and weapons and huts become de-
corated, how art springs from the reli-
gious and social and technical life. The
psychologist links these first traces of
art with the productions of civilized peo-
ples. His interest is not that of the
philological historian; he does not care
for the single work of art as the unique
occurrence; no, he looks for the psy-
chological laws which under the varying
circumstances produce just the given
works of poetry and sculpture, of music
and architecture and painting. We learn
to understand how climate and political
conditions, technical, material, and social
institutions, models and surrounding na-
ture, brought it about that Egypt and
China and India, or Greece and Italy
und Germany, had just their own devel-
opment of artistic production. Art be-
comes thus an element of the social
consciousness, together with law and re-
ligion, science and politics; but art is
psychologically still more interesting than
any other function of the national soul,
because it is less necessary for the biolo-
gical existence than any other production
of man. Art is therefore freer, follows
more easily every pressure and tension,
every inner tendency and outer opportu-
nity; it can fully disappear even in the
strongest social organism, and can break
out in fullest glory even in the weakest
sociological body. It is in its incompa-
rable manifoldness and easiness of adap-
tation that art shows best how the mental
products of man are dependent upon the
totality of variable conditions.
	Wbile such a sociological view con-
trasts different periods and nations, psy-
chology does not overlook the differences
among individuals. The general artistic
level of the whole social mind is only
one side of the problem; the variation
of individuals above and below this level,
from the anti-aesthetic philistine to the
greatest genius, is the other side, and
here also the dependence upon the most
diverse conditions attracts interest. The
psychologist consults biography, espe-
cially the autobiographies of poets and
painters, and follows up most carefully
the subtle influences which fertilized the
imagination and gave the abnormal di-
rection to the personality.
	Studying thus the artistic production</PB>

in individuals at all times and at all
places, psychology finally abstracts a gen-
eral understanding of the creative pro-
cess and its conditions. There appears
nothing mysterious in it: by manifold
threads it seems connected with the men-
tal functions of simple attention, with in-
hibition and suggestion; in other direc-
tions with dreams and illusions, and also
with the abnormal functions of hypno-
tism and insanity. It is a most complex
process, truly, in which the whole per-
sonality is engaged, but it is connected
by short steps with so much simpler
events in mental life, and it can so easily
be traced back to the artistic elements in
the child, that the psychologist has no
reason to despair; the artistic function
of the brain is not beyond the causal un-
derstanding. The niachinery of modern
psychological conceptions, the atomistic
sensations and their laws of association
and inhibition, can by principle explain
it in its entirety, from the schoolboys
drawing of profiles on his blotting-paper
up to Michael Angelos decoration of the
dome of St. Peters with immortal re-
ligious frescoes.
	Very different indeed are the methods
by which we investigate our second
group of ~esthetical problems, the psy-
chological effect of the beautiful object.
Experimental psychology enters here
into its rights. When the students of
mental life, twenty years ago, took up
the exact method of natural science and
worked out experimental schemes for
the most refined analysis of psychical
processes, it seemed at first a matter of
course that only the intellectual pro-
cesses, especially the functions of per-
ception, and perhaps the elementary ac-
tivities, would offer themselves to such
inquiries. But slowly the new method
has reached and conquered one field af-
ter another,  memory and imagination,
association and apperception, feeling and
emotion, undeveloped and abnormal men-
tal states; and now, in different places,
experimental work is dealing with the
most delicate psychical fact, the a3stheti-
cal feeling and its conditions.
	Fechner gave a strong impulse to such
an experimental study of testhetic ele-
ments a long time ago. He asked sys-
tematically a large number of persons
which one of a set of rectangles, for in-
stance, each of them preferred; the ten
forms varied from a square to a rectan-
gle with a length of five and a breadth
of two inches. He found a marked
asthetical preference for those forms
which are determined by the golden sec-
tion; that is, in which the short side
stands to the long side as the latter
stands to the sum of both. To-day time
work transcends in every direction such
elementary beginnings. In the first
place, it is not confined to a special art.
Music and poetry share equally with the
visible arts. The mesthetical harmony
and discord of tones, their relation to
beats and overtones, to the fusion and
the discrimination of tones, to timbre
and duration; in the same way, the mu-
sical properties of rhythm, its relations
to the attention and time sense, to th5
physiological processes of breathing and
muscle tension, and to many other psy-
cho-physical functions,  all these have
become the problems of the experimental
psychologist. These studies of musi-
cal rhythm naturally turn the attention
toward the elements of poetry; the ex-
perimental study of rhythm in the verse,
and its relation to the position of the
rhyme, to the length of the stanza, to
the fluctuations of apperception, to the
physiological functions, and so forth, is
exceedingly promising, although still in
its beginning.
	Much more developed is the attempt
to reach experimentally the characteris-
tics of the visible arts. Material and
form, above all color and shape, offer
themselves in an unlimited series of
problems. The color spectrum has been
always at home in the laboratory, but
the psychologist has studied color as an
element of perception or as a function of</PB>

the eye, not as the object of testhetical
feeling. iNow his studies take this direc-
tion. Which of two colors is preferred:
how does this preference depend upon
saturation, brightness, extension? What
combination of colors is agreeable: how
does this effect depend upon the relative
extension of the colored surface; how
upon the colored materials and the re-
lation between their intensity or their
whiteness? Which shapes and angles
and sections are preferred: how does
this preference depend upon associations,
or upon our bodily positioi4 or upon eye
movements? How is the plastic effect,
perhaps in stereoscopic vision, influen-
cing the intensity of ~sthetic feeling;
how does movement influence it, or the
combination of shape with color? In a
series of rectangles or ellipses or bisected
lines, is only one of them agreeable, or
has the curve of onr ~esthetical pleasure
several maximal points?
	The experimental investigation may
come still much nearer to the problem of
fine arts. I take as illustration a series
of experiments which make up part of
a recent thesis from the Harvard labo-
ratory. The problem is the pleasing
balance of two sides of an mesthetic ob-
ject. That is, of coarse, realized in the
simplest way by geometrical symmetry
as many works of architecture show it;
we have this pleasing feeling of equi-
librium, also, when we see a well-com-
posed building of which the two halves
are far from identical, and every paint-
ing shows this ideal symmetry of com-
position without the monotony of geo-
metrical uniformity; so it is even in
the most irregular Japanese arrange-
ment. The question arises under what
conditions this demand for balance is
fulfilled, if the objects in both halves are
different. Translated into the methods
of experimental psychology, the question
would be, how far, for instance, a long
vertical line must be from the centre of
a framed field, if a line of half its length
is at a given distance from the centre
on the other side; how far if a point or
a curve of special form or two lines are
there. The variations are endless. In
an absolutely dark room is a framed
field of black cloth, which is so illumi-
nated that no other object in the room
is visible ; by a little device, bright lines,
points, curves, also letters, pictures, ob-
jects, can be made to move over this field
without showing the moving apparatus,
while the exact position of each is indi-
cated on a scale. One line may be given
on the left side, and the experimenter
has to find the most pleasing position of
a double line on the other, imitating thus
the case when two figures are to be on
one side of a painting, while one only is
to balance them on the other side; where
must it stand? Starting from such sim-
ple lines, the investigation turns to more
complicated questions: What is the in-
fluence of the impression of depth ? 
for instance, a fiat picture on one side, a
picture representing depth on the other.
What is the influence of interest ?  a
meaningless paper on one side, a paper
of equal size with interesting figures on
the other side. What is the influence
of apparent movement ?  a picture of
a resting object on one side, an equally
large object which suggests movement
in a special direction on the other. So
the problem can easily be carried to a
complication of conditions which does
justice to the manifoldness of principles
involved in the compositioti of paintings,
sculptures, decorations, interiors, build-
ings, and landscapes. If, finally, all these
experiments are carried out under dif-
ferent subjective conditions, in different
states of bodily position, of eye move-
inent, of distance, of attention, of fatigue,
under different degrees of illumination,
with different colors, with different asso-
ciations, all with different subjects and
in steady relation to the real objects of
historical art, we learn slowly to under-
stand our mesthetic pleasure in the balance
of a composition, and its relation to the
functions of our body.</PB>

	Some one may say: All these experi-
ments are too simple; they may be quite
interesting, but they never reach the
complicateness of real art. What are
those simple figures beside a Madonna,
those primitive harmonies beside a sym-
phony? Yet is it a reproach to the
physicist that he studies the nature of
the gigantic thunderstorm, not from an
equally large electrical discharge, but
from the small sparks of his little labora-
tory machine ? And if the physicist is
interested in the waves of the ocean, he
studies the movements in a small tank
of water in his working-room, and intro-
duces simple artificial movements. It is
just the elementary character of experi-
mental methods which guarantees their
power for explanation; and iesthetical
effects can be psychologically under-
stood only if we study their elements in
the most schematic way possible. The
necessary presupposition is, of course,
that the iestbetical attitude itself can be
maintained also in the laboratory rooms,
and there is no reason for being skeptical
about that. With regard to practical
emotions such skepticism may be cor-
rect: we cannot love and hate, nor ad-
mire and detest, in the laboratory, and
it may even be said that the joy in the
laboratory is not agreeable, and the pain
is not painful. But the iesthetical emo-
tion remains intact precisely on account
of the absence of every practical relation
in it. The beautiful or the ugly thing
lasts as such in every corner of our
workshop.
	The experimental study of the psy-
chological effect of art seems thus even
more safely housed than the biological
and historical study of the psychologi-
cal production of art, and both together
form already a psychological system of
~sthetics which certainly still has blanks,
but which is surprisingly near complete-
ness. Psychology will go on in this way
till the most delicate cause and the most
subtle effect of each artistic work are
understood by the action of causal laws,
like any other cause and effect in na-
ture.
	Before us lies the question which is
important for the teacher: how far the
results of such studies can become pro-
ductive, or at least suggestive, for in-
struction in artistic drawing. Here again
we must separate the two sides,  the
causes and the effects of the beautiful
objects. The causes which produce the
drawing are the activities of the pupil;
the effects are the impressions on the
spectator. The study of the causes will
help us to uMerstand how to train the
iesthetical activities of the pupil; the
study of the effects will help us to ad-
vise how the drawing or painting should
be made up in order to please others.
The study of the causes suggests to us
methods of teaching; the study of the
effects suggests rules and facts which are
to be taught. The study of the causes
interests only the teacher who handles
the pupil; the study of the effects offers
insight which the teacher may share with
the pupil.
	Think first of the effects. Psycholo-
gy has analyzed the impressions on our
sense of beauty, and each fact must
express a rule which can be learned.
Blue and red are agreeable, blue and
green are disagreeable: therefore com-
bine red and blue, but not green and
blue. The golden section of a line is the
most agreeable of all divisions: there-
fore try to divide all lines, if possible,
according to this rule. Such psycholo-
gical prescriptions hold, of course, for
all arts: do not make verses with lines
of ten feet; do not compose music in a
scale of fifths. Step by step we come
to the prescription for a tragedy, for
a symphony, for a Renaissance palace;
how much more for the details of a sim-
ple drawing! Fill the space thus and
thus; take care of good balance; if there
is a long line on one side, make the
short line on the other side nearer to the
centre: these are m~sthetical prescriptions
which can be learned and exercised like</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00645" SEQ="0645" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="639">	Psychology and Art.	639

the laws of perspective for architectural
drawing. Whenever the pupil follows
the rules, his drawing will avoid dis-
agreeable shocks to the spectator. I
am free, I trust, from the suspicion that
I overestimate the value of experimental
psychology for teachers; I have often
attacked its misuses. Here the case is
quite different. Such prescriptions do
not prescribe the ways of teaching, but
are material of instruction. There is
no other school subject for which psy-
chology supplies such material. Mathe-
matics and natural sciences, languages
and history, are not learned in school
with reference to their psychological ef-
fects. Art, however, has an absolutely
exceptional position. My belief, there-
fore, that methods of teaching cannot be
learned to - day from the psychological
laboratory is no contradiction of my ac-
knowledgment that artistic prescriptions,
worthy to be taught, can be deduced
from psychology. I see with great plea-
sure that the development in this direc-
tion goes steadily on, and that children
learn easily and joyfully the ways of
avoiding ugly lines and arrangements.
	My objections of principle against
teaching on the basis of psychological
knowledge interfere much more with
the pedagogical results which may per-
haps be indicated by the study of the
psychological causes of art. If we ap-
ply here our theoretical insight at all,
the result cannot have the form, Teach
your pupils to make the drawing thus
and so; but the form, Teach thus and
so your pupils to make a drawing. If
we understand the causes which produce
a beautiful drawing, and if by our teach-
ing we can influence the central system
of the child so that the causes for such
production are established, then it seems
that the goal is reached. But we are
not only far from a full understanding;
we are endlessly further from such de-
sired influences. To know the chemical
constitution of an egg does not mean the
power to produce an egg which can be
hatched. We cannot make a genius,
we cannot make a talent; and the psy-
chological analysis alone indicates only
slightly even how to evolve from a bad
draughtsman a good one. We may make
the general abstraction that constant
training is a good thing; to reach such
a triviality, however, we need psychology
as little as we need scientific physiology
to find out that eating is useful for our
nourishment. Wherever psychological
speculation goes further, it is finally de-
pendent upon secondary factors which
are determined by presuppositions of
non-psychological character, and thus
the results may be quite contradictory:
the one recommends the study of nature,
the other only imagination; the one pro-
poses flowers for models, the other geo-
metrical figures; the one lines, the oth-
er colors. Psychology listens carefully
to all, but is responsible for none of
these propositions. An examination of
the papers which drawing-superintend-
ents and drawing-teachers usually read
at their meetings shows, indeed, that they
belong for the most part to a species
well known in all our educational ga-
therings. The first half of each paper
is made up of familiar sentences taken
from good textbooks of physiological
psychology,  the ganglion cells of the
optical centres play the chief rOle in the
drawing associations,  and the second
half of the paper contains a list of ex-
cellent educational suggestions; only the
chief thing, the proof that the sugges-
tions are really consequences of the text-
book abstracts, is forgotten. The two
parts have often not the slightest con-
nection. The second half alone would
appear commonplace, and the first alone
would appear out of place; together they
make a scholarly impression, even if they
have nothing to do with each other.
	Perhaps one other danger in these
practical movements of to-day deserves
mention. The fact that drawings, paint-
ings, pictures, please us encourages the
working out of technical prescriptions</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00646" SEQ="0646" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="640">	640	Psychology and Art.
from them for instruction in art; but the
pleasure must be a pure and natural one,
as little as possible dependent upon fugi-
tive fashions and capricious tastes; and
if our pleasure is a refined eccentricity,
or even perversity, it is certain that we
have no right to infect with it the taste
of the younger generation. Seldom has
this danger been so near as in our time,
with its preraphaelitic and Japanese
preferences, with its poster style and its
stylistic restlessness. The healthy at-
mosphere for the taste of the child is
harmonious classical beauty~ The man
who has passed his training in pure
beauty may reach a point where a re-
action against classicism is a sound and
mature ~esthetical desire, but to begin
with eccentric realism or with mysteri-
ous symbolism in an immature age is a
blunder. The educational mistake be-
comes worse if that style is allowed in
the schoolroom which is over - indulged
in our time, and which is most antago-
nistic to the childs mind: I mean the
primitivistic style of our posters and
bindings. The simple forms of primi-
tivistic art are not a real returning to
the beginnings of art, which would be
quite adapted to children. No; this
style means an ironical playing with the
primitive forms on the basis of a most
artful art. It is masquerading with the
costumes of simplicity, not real desire
for simple nature; and the spirit of
irony alone makes it possible, and so
dangerously attractive for our taste. If
a school exhibition of drawings in the
style of the Yellow Book appears to our
eye pleasant and almost refreshing, af-
ter the tiresome elaborations of our own
school-time, it is our moral duty to ask,
not what we like, but what children
ought to learn to like. Irony toward
the most mature products of civilization
ought not to flourish in a childs mind;
and if the ironical curves of the Beards-
ley style become the trained methods of
children, who finally believe that they
really see nature in conventionalized
poster style and use those hues thought-
lessly as patterns, the result is decidedly
a perverse one. Nevertheless, the future
may be wiser; psychology will perhaps
help pedagogics to find the way to de-
velop the facility of pupils in producing
fair drawings; and if we are willing to
take the hope for the fact, we may say
that psychology gives to the teacher
prescriptions for training the child to
draw better and better, and, above all,
prescriptions which the child itself can
learn, prescriptions for the composition
and arrangement of a drawing which
shall please others. Art can thus be
fully described psychologically and ex-
plained with regard both to its condi-
tions and to its effects, and both groups
of facts can become suggestive for the
construction of rules for the teaching of
drawing. The relations of psychology
and art are then important and sugges-
tive ones; and yet, is that our final word?
Has philosophy nothing else to say?
	I know quite well that there are
plenty of men who would say, Yes, that
is the whole story. I think, however,
the number is increasing of those who
see that while half a truth is true as far
as its half goes, half a truth is a lie if
it pretends to be the whole. It seems
to me, indeed, that this psychological
scheme is one-sided, and that our time
confronts dangers for its ideal life if
triumphant psychology crushes under its
feet every idealistic opposition. It is
with art here exactly as with science and
with morality. Psychology proclaims:
We can describe and explain every
thought of science and every decision of
morality from an atomistic naturalistic
point of view; we can understand it as
the necessary result of the foregoing psy-
cho-physical conditions. There is then
no absolute truth in science, no absolute
virtue in morality; duties are trained
associations, and the value of our ac-
tions, as of our thinking, lies in their
agreeable effects. Art easily joins the
others ; if there is no truth and no vir</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00647" SEQ="0647" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="641">	Psychology and Art.	641

tue which is more than the product of
the circumstances, then there is no beauty
which has absolute value; then beauty
has no other meaning than that which
psychology describes; it is the effect of
some psychological processes, and the
cause of some agreeable psychological
results; and if we are careful to prepare
those conditions and to insure that out-
come, then we have done all that the
~nsthetical luxury of society can wish for
its entertainment.
	I do not deny the right of psychology
to consider the world of beautiful crea-
tions from such a point of view, and as
a psychologist I do my best to help in
such investigations; but I cannot forget
that this view-point is an artificial one
for living, real art; that it is artificial
both for the subject who creates art and
for the subject who enjoys art; that it is
artificial wherever art is felt in its full
meaning.
	I say that psychology has its full right
of way within its own limits; it has lim-
its, however, and they are much nar-
rower than the superficial impression
may make us believe. Psychology has to
describe and to explain mental life; but
description and explanation are possible
only for objects. Explanation always
presupposes description, and the very
idea of description presupposes the ex-
istence of objects. Psychology consid-
ers mental life, therefore, only in so far
as it can be thought as a series of exist-
ing objects,  objects which exist in con-
sciousness as physical objects exist in
space.
	We have not to ask here why it is
important for the purposes of life and
thought to consider the mental world as
if it were a world of objects. We are
sure that in the primary reality our
inner life does not mean to us such a
world of objects only. Our perceptions
and conceptions may reach us as objects,
while our feelings, our emotions, our
judgments, our volitions, do not come
in question with us first as objects which
	VOL. Lxxxii.  NO. 493.	41
we passively perceive, but as activities
which we live out, as activitie~i the re-
ality of which cannot be described and
causally explained; it must be felt and
understood and interpreted. In short,
we are not merely passive subjects with a
world of conscious objects; we are will-
ing subjects, whose acts of will have not
less reality in spite of the fact that they
are no objects at all. To consider the
mental world, including the feeling and
will, psychologically means an artificial
transformation and substitution which
may have its value for special purposes,
but which leads us away from reality.
The reality of the will and feeling and
judgment does not belong to the describ-
able world, but to a world which has
to be appreciated; it has to be linked,
therefore, not by the categories of cause
and effect, but by those of meaning and
value. And in this world of will relations
grows and blossoms and flowers Art.
	Let us examine the characteristics of
this great network of will attitudes, in
which the personality feels itself a will-
ing subject, and acknowledges all other
subjects as volitional also. One distinc-
tion is of paramount importance: our
will may be thought of as an individ-
ual attitude, or it may arise with the
meaning of an over-individual decision
that demands acknowledgment by every
subject, and that is willed, therefore, in-
dependently of our merely personal de-
sires. It is an act of will which is
meant as necessary for every subject,
which ought to be acted by everybody:
we call it duty. From a purely psycho-
logical standpoint, the will thought as
object is determined in any case,  the
virtuous act as well as the crime, the
nonsensical judgment as well as the wise
one. From the critical standpoint of
reality, the special will decision is neces-
sary if it belongs to the very nature of
will, binds every will, not by natural law,
but by obligation; and it can be and is
unnecessary if it is merely personal ar-
bitrariness.</PB>

	This doubleness of duty and arbitra-
riness in our will repeats itself in every
division of possible will activities, and
there exist four such departments of re-
lations of will to the world, four possi-
bilities of reacting on the world. First,
the subject may change the objects of
the world by his actions; secondly, may
decide for additional supplements to
the given objects; thirdly, may trans-
form the objects in his thought so that
they form a connection; and fourthly,
may transform the objects so that they
stand each for itself. If these four possi-
ble subjective acts are performed by the
individual personal arbitrary will, they
represent individual values. The ac-
tions toward the world are then such
changes of the objects as are useful and
practical for our comfort; the supple-
mentations are then the play of our
fancy and imagination; the connections
are then expressions of our hope or
fear; the isolations, finally, are means
to our personal enjoyment. These four
functions may be carried out also as
functions of the deeper, over-individual,
necessary will; that is, as functions of
duty. Those actions which alter and
change the objective world are then
moral actions; the ideas which supple-
ment the world make up religion; those
transformations which bring out a con-
nection between the objects of the world
compose scientific truth; and finally,
those transformations which isolate the
objects, so that they stand each for it-
self, form the domain of beauty.
	Truth and beauty thus represent du-
ties, logical and ~esthetical duties, just
as morality represents ethical duties.
We choose and form the physical axiom
in science so, and not otherwise, because
our will is bound by duty to do so; that
is, only that particular decision of our
affirming will can demand acknowledg-
ment by every subject; and thus art
chooses the forms and lines, the colors
and curves, of the Sistine Madonna just
so, and not otherwise, because only this
decision of the creating will is as it ought
to be, as duty prescribes, as it can de-
mand that every willing subject ought
to acknowledge it. Everything in this
world is beautiful, and is a joy forever
if it is so transformed that it does not
suggest anything else than itself, that it
contains all elements for the fulfillment
of the whole in itself. We do not ask
for the arms and legs of the person
whose marble bust the artist gives us,
and we do not ask for his complexion
either. We do not ask how the field
and forest look outside of the frame of
the landscape painting, and we do not
ask what the persons in the drama have
done before and will do after the story.
Our works of art are not in our space
and not in our time; their frame is
their own world, which they never tran-
scend. Real art makes us forget that
the pninting is only a piece of canvas,
and that Hamlet is only an actor, and
not the prince. We forget the connec-
tions, we abstract from all relations, we
think of the object in itself; and wher-
ever we do so, we proceed Lesthetically.
And if we enjoy the great works of art,
the essential function is not the individ-
ual enjoyment of our senses and feel-
ings, like the enjoyment in eating and
drinking; no, it is the volitional acknow-
ledgment of the will of the artist. We
will with him; and if we appreciate his
work as beautiful, we acknowledge that
it is as we feel that it ought to be; that
our will of thinking that particle of the
world is lifted to its duties; that we
have transcended the sphere of merely
personal arbitrariness and its desires
and agreeable fulfillments; that we have
reached the sphere of the over-individual
values. Whoever understands art as will
function believes in art and appreciates
it as a world of duties; psychology has
not to try to understand it as such, but
to transform it into something else, into
a set of objects which have causes and
effects. Psychology must destroy the
deepest meaning of art, just as it dis</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00649" SEQ="0649" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="643">	Psychology and Art.	643
regards the deepest meaning of truth
and morality, if it tries to present its
view as the last word about our inner
activities.
	And if art is thus a realization of du-
ties which have their real meaning in
this acknowledgment of the will, in
what light should we see all these tech-
nical rules and prescriptions for facili-
tating in the child the production of
artistic works, and for preventing him
from making disagreeable drawings?
Those rules and prescriptions remain
quite good and valid. They do for real
beauty and art just what the police and
the prisons on the one side, the training
of habits and manners on the other side,
do for real morality. Nobody will un-
derestimate the value of the fact that
our children learn through training a
thousand habits which keep them as a
matter of course out of conflict with the
laws, and that police and jails remind
them again and again, Do not leave the
safe tracks. Whoever lives a noble life,
however, means by morality and duty
something else and something higher.
Habits and jails do not insure that in an
important conflict of life, where personal
interests stand against duty, the bad ac-
tion may not triumph. Only a conscience
which is penetrated by morality stands
safe in all storms, and such a conscience
is not brought out by technical prescrip-
tions, nor by punishments and jails; no,
only by the obligatory power of will upon
will, by the inspiring life of subjects we
acknowledge, by the example of the he-
roes of duty, that speaks directly from
will to will, and for which we cannot sub-
stitute psychological training and police
officers. And thus the duty of art. Do
not believe that the easier production of
a not disagreeable drawing means a
positive gain for real art and beauty:
it raises the standard, it uplifts the level
of a~sthetic production, just as the stan-
dard of moral behavior is lifted by the
existence of a watchful police, and it
is extremely important. Do not forget,
however, that ~esthetical life also needs
not only the policemans function, but
above all the ministers and helpers
function; in other words, not technical
rules, but duties; not easy production,
but convictions; not knowledge of psy-
chological effects, but belief in absolute
values.
	This attitude becomes the more im-
portant as this whole view shows that
the world of art is in no way subordi-
nate to or less true than the world of
science. The reality is neither that
which the scientist describes nor that
which the artist sketches; both are trans-
formations for a special purpose. The
scientist, we have seen, transforms for
the purpose of connection, and in that
service he constructs atoms which exist
nowhere but in his thought. The artist
transforms in the interest of isolation,
and in that service lie constructs his
drawings. The mechanical process of
drawing as such is, of course, not art in
itself; it is the mental means of expres-
sion which can communicate science as
well as art. Just as words can serve
Shakespeare as well as Darwin, so lines
and curves can serve the mathematician
and the physicist as well as the artist;
the purpose alone separates the poet
from the biologist, the scientist from the
artist. And if art thus means a world
which is exactly as true and valuable as
the world of science, let us not forget
that the school lesson in drawing means
contact with this world of art,  that is,
with the special spirit of iesthetic du-
ties; and that every drawing - teacher
ought to be, not an ~esthetical policeman
only, but an inspiring believer in these
sacred ~sthetic duties.

Doubtless this confession will read to
some like the words of a coward. But
why should a superintendent ruin his
chances of success in things more vital
to the schools than the use of this or

	I am on good terms with book agents.
I find them always genial and well in-

them, but it will not do to make them
any promises.

not belong to the ring, and others because
they see the thorough selfishness of the
management; but no one rebels. The
managers mean to have good schools;
they are far-seeing men, to whom a de-
finite policy can be presented with the
certainty that it will be comprehended,
and the probability that it will be ap-
proved unless it will affect unfavorably
some of their friends.
	Working for ones friends, in it-
self a praiseworthy thing and accounted
by politicians the highest virtue, is the
bane of the schools. The average com-
mittee man looks at all questions from
this point of view, How will it affect
me and my friends? not, How will
it affect the schools? The man who
can get upon a school committee is the
man who is most in earnest to help his
friends. This man is usually a politi-
cian or one who aspires to political in-
fluence. The man next to him in evil
influence is likely to be the pastor of a
church, for whose members and their
sons and daughters he must do what he
can to find places or to maintain them
in their places. The politician is look-
ing for him, and quickly offers his aid.
The good clergyman, in return for the
aid of the politician in securing a place
for A, who is a worthy case, agrees
to vote for B, of whom he knows little,
and as to whom he shuts his eyes if the
revelations are likely to trouble his con-
science. Then there is the doctor who
feels under obligations to his patients, or
to those for whom his patients request
his favor.
	The best members of a school com-
mittee are lawyers and business men
who handle large enterprises. These
men are more independent than others,
and have broader views. A scheme of
instruction or a plan of management
will be considered by them on its mer-
its, and not solely with reference to its
effect on certain individuals.
	What use in talking to a man about
some plan for improving the teaching
force of a city, when the main query in
his mind is, How will this affect my
chances of getting teachers appointed, or
how will it serve my other interests?
This personal question and the combi-
nations made to effect its satisfactory
answer are what is meant by school
politics.
	In twenty years of school teaching
and superintending I have not known
any school question to be decided by
Democrats or Republicans as such. I
have read and heard that such influences
have affected other superintendents, but
they have never affected me.
So far as the appointment and reten-
tion of teachers are concerned, the whole
foundation of evil is broadly covered by
this unblushing declaration of a San
Francisco school director 
I was brought up in this town, and
of course have a certain number of
friends who want and expect positions.
Each director appoints his own friends
and relatives, and their names are never
questioned by the elementary commit-
tee, nor by the full board when it meets
to elect candidates. That is a courtesy
which is extended by every director to
each of his fellow directors,  the minor-
ity, of course, excepted.
	My own experience is that school
committee men act upon the same prin-
ciple in New England as in California,
though they are less outspoken about it.
	The appointment of teachers is as
well managed as are other city appoint-
ments. The poor get relief, the streets
are laid out, the police are selected, not
on the sole basis of the best service to
the public, but, in many cases, on the
plan of every man getting as much for
his neighborhood or his friends as possi-
ble. An alderman who cannot get work
on the streets or in the parks for his
constituents, who has small influence in
securing places on the police force or
in the fire department, will have small
chance of re~lection, in many wards.
	A remedy for the evils connected with</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00652" SEQ="0652" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="646">646	Confessions of Three School Superintendents.
appointments must be found in a change
of public sentiment. Public office is a
public trust, and not a private snap.
A generation of schoolchildren must be
trained to right views on such questions.
The schools must share in the general
moral nplift; yea, more, they must stand
apart from ordinary municipal depart-
ments as something to be managed on a
higher moral plane.
	The evil influence of the appointment
of teachers by means of pulls does
not appear so much in the character of
the persons appointed as it does in the
demoralization of the body of teachers.
It removes a strong incentive to personal
improvement. If appointments depend
on pulls, so may promotions and trans-
fers. Each teacher feels secure in her
position as long as she has a friend who
has influence, or who is on friendly terms
with some one who has it. It has sev-
eral times happened to me that teachers
who have been admonished of some neg-
lect, mistake, or inefficiency have gone
to their friends for protection, instead
of avoiding danger by trying to do bet-
ter.
	I would not, however, leave the false
impression that dealing with teachers
who fail in their work and depend upon
influence to keep their positions is one of
the chief troubles of a superintendent.
His greatest difficulty with teachers is
with those  and their name is legion
 who are conscientious and painstak-
ing, anxious to do well, always doing
their best, and yet from lack of vigor
and adaptation failing to become effi-
cient. A superintendent, even if he have
the heart to dismiss such teachers, will
rarely find either his committee or the
public supporting his action; for no one
but himself realizes how schools suffer
from such teachers.
	While making confessions, I must
not neglect to confess that when myself
a teacher, I always tried to get the poor-
est third of each class to do all the work
laid down in the course of study. This
was a constant struggle, and always a
partial failure. The very poorest were
dropped to the grade below, or left be-
hind at the class promotion; while many,
with much sighing on their part and
urging on my part, often by grace and
not by right, obtained promotion. When
I became a superintendent the same
plan was continued for a time, as I then
knew no better way.
	Such struggle and partial accomplish-
ment are not the right processes for
intellectual development, and through
them the moral nature receives much
harm. Perhaps the results to the most
capable pupils are quite as damaging as
to the poorest ones. Tied down to those
inferior in speed, they have fretted at the
slow progress, if they were ambitious; or
they have grown indifferent, disposed
to dillydallying, if they quietly accepted
the conditions. Their loss includes not
merely the failure to gain what might
have been gained, but also the habit of
half-hearted effort. More and more I
sympathize with bright pupils, for our
public schools often fail to meet their
needs and give them inspiration.
	The remedy for these evils is not far
to seek. Make the course of study for
the slower, weaker pupils, and let the
brighter ones go faster or take additional
work. In the primary and lower gram-
mar grades, the first of these alternatives
is the correct one; in the higher gram-
mar grades and in the high school, ad-
ditional work in a heavier course is the
proper remedy. The bright pupils ought
to work as hard as the dull ones. The
teacher of the bright division ought to
work as hard as the teacher of the slow-
er division,  in the one case in laying
out more work, in the other in seeking
simpler explanations.
	The superintendent is less secure in
his position than the humblest teacher.
In all the large towns in New England,
whatever their nominal term, teachers
have practically life tenure of office.
They need but to do their duty, and only</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00653" SEQ="0653" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="647">Confessions of Three School Superintendents.	647

their duty, to hold their positions past
the days of their most efficient service.
Whatever may have happened outside
my range of observation, within it I
have never known a teacher to lose a
position that he deserved to retain.
	The superintendent must stand the
shocks. He is the victim of the political
overturns. He must defend all the
teachers unjustly assailed, making their
cause his own. Protecting a teacher in
her control of her school may bring him
into collision with an irate and influen-
tial citizen. All general failures and
most special ones are laid at his door.
If the superintendent amounts to much,
he will be found in the way of the plans
of unscrupulous persons and their selfish
interests. If he amounts to little, he
will be accused of inefficiency and lack
of backbone. The superintendent who
loses his place is often superior to him
who retains his place. The fact of hold-
ing or losing ones place is no proof of
real merit.
	The superintendencics in the small
towns are more difficult to fill than those
in the large towns. The duties are more
multifarious, tempests arise on smaller
provocations, there is more gossip, and
one or two citizens are more likely to
control the fate of the superintendent.
A man who remains several years at his
post in a small town, and is respected by
all citizens as a sincere and capable of-
ficial who is making excellent schools,
may with safety and profit be transferred
to take the place of a superintendent in
a large town who is never heard from
as accomplishing anything either by ac-
tion or by inhibition.
	The superintendent in a large town is
less under watch and ward. He can
differentiate his system and try experi-
ments without incurring expense or dis-
tracting the teachers. He has a better
opportunity for intellectual and profes-
sional growth. He can concentrate his
efforts on the professional rather than
on the business side of his work, and
become an expert whose judgment car-
ries weight in all educational matters.
	But in any place, small or large, that
superintendent will in the long run be
most secure who stands honestly, de-
cidedly, and yet courteously, for right
methods, good teachers, and fair deal-
ing.
II.

	As in most communities in the South
and West, the prevailing sentiment re-
garding schools and school-teaching here
where I serve is that the schoolroom is
a very proper place to pension indigent
gentlewomen. Teaching is regarded as
a dignified calling for anybody in indi-
gent circumstances who is unable to do
any other work. This is generally the
kind of application one hears: I have
a young friend who has been through
the high school, whose father is dead,
and who is obliged to support her mo-
ther. She is a nice girl and a good
girl, and I want you to help me get her
a school.
	Has she any preparation for teach-
ing? Has she ever attended a normal
school, or studied with reference to
teaching?
	Oh no, but I think she will make
you a good teacher, and I want you to
give her a trial.
	Such an argument does not convince
the superintendent, but it is very per-
suasive with kind-hearted members of
the board of education. So they supple-
ment the request that the young lady
may have a fair trial at the examina-
tion. Be easy on her for her fathers
sake.
	Upon one occasion I made a report
to the board of education, in which I
took strong ground in favor of allowing
only those to teach in our public schools
who had a normal training or who were
experienced teachers. The president of
the board met me afterward and re-
marked that the report was excellent in
theory, but in these degenerate times it
was impracticable.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00654" SEQ="0654" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="648">648	Confessions of Three School Superintendents.
	Since then some of my theories in re-
gard to teachers have changed. I have
found very fine teaching power in some
young women who never saw the inside
of a normal school, and whose record for
scholarship in our local high schools was
not the best. They had that unexami-
nable, indefinable power of controlling,
interesting, and instructing children that
seems to be an endowment. No nor-
mal school can give this ability, and no
lack of normal school training can take
it away. The best that a normal school
can do is to develop the teaching talent
and direct the teaching power, so that
the born teacher will not waste time in
learning her own strength by practicing
on her pupils.
	We must come to this proposition in
our town and in other towns, namely,
that a teacher can be discovered only by
her teaching, and the best examination
possible is a trial in the schoolroom. Giv-
en a young woman who appears to have
all the requisites,  a good education,
good health, and a fair knowledge of
what the demands of the schoolroom
are,  and the only true way to proceed
is to give her three months, or longer if
advisable, as a trial. She will then show
what she can do, and I do not believe
that a satisfactory test can be made in
any other way.
	I have two cases in point. Several
years ago a young woman came to me
for a school, and as I talked with her I
made up my mind that she would not be
a good teacher. She became a candi-
date before the board for a position,
however, and her friends were active. I
could do nothing but consent to give
her a trial, though I looked upon the
trial as likely to be a failure, and I so
expressed myself. To my utmost sur-
prise, the young woman walked into the
schoolroom, took up the reins of man-
agement, showed pluck and ingenuity,
read all the books she could get hold of,
and at the end of three years was the
leading teacher of her grade in the city.
To-day her grade work is the model for
younger teachers, who love to see how
easily she manages.~~
	On the other hand, I observed in a
rural school a young woman who I
thought was the very person I needed for
a certain kind of work in the city schools.
I made it my business to see the board
of education, and guaranteed the excel-
lence of her work. I staked my repu-
tation as a superintendent on her abil-
ity to teach. The board consented, and
I sent for the young woman and told her
of my recommendations. To my cha-
grin, she seemed lost from the day she
began. She never saw the difference
between an ungraded rural school of thir-
ty pupils and a graded school of fifty pu-
pils. Her previous training had ruined
her for other work, and she did not get
control of the situation. She struggled
on for three years, and then she left the
profession for the better field of matri-
mony.
	One of the most perplexing problems
that ever confronted a superintendent is
what to do with an old, poor, and thor-
oughly inefficient teacher. I have such
a problem before me now. On one side
there are the pupils, who are poorly
taught and badly disciplined. Their
time is practically wasted, and the peo-
ple say it is a shame to keep such a per-
son upon the teaching corps. The tax-
payers also complain that the board
ought to have the courage to discharge
the aged and incompetent teacher; but
this complaint is made in a very quiet
and confidential way. On the other
side is the fact that the old lady has
served the board thirty years, has been
a faithful teacher, is now old and poor,
and to discharge her means the poor-
house for her and several dependents.
There is absolutely nobody to take care
of her. Should we discharge her, the
very persons who say that she ought to
be dismissed would rise up and declare
it was an outrage to put an old servant
out. The very parents who say their</PB>

children are learning nothing would sign
a paper declaring they were perfectly
satisfied, and the superintendent would
be regarded as a heartless wretch, and
the board of education as a soulless corpo-
ration. The law says we cannot pension
her, and so we are now quietly awaiting
the time when, having served her day
and several generations of children, she
will be called to her deserved rest.
Perhaps, after all, this is best. We are
but human, and one case out of nearly
two hundred will not seriously affect
us.
	Sometimes, indeed many times, the
people themselves are the source of our
troubles. Theoretically, public opinion
controls all public institutions. But this
acts directly in some instances, and in-
directly in other instances. In all the
cases above mentioned the action was
indirect, in that it had to exert itself
first upon the members of the board.
But now I come to speak of the direct
contact of the public and the schools.
Let me cite an illustration. The board
decided to introduce physical culture in
the schools, and for that purpose em-
ployed a young lady from a distance
who knew her business thoroughly. She
prepared some blank forms of inquiry
about the physical tendencies of the pu-
pils, and gave each one a copy to be
filled out at home. The director wanted
a diagnosis of each child, in order to in-
form herself and the grade teacher of
any physical defect, such as heart dis-
ease, tendency to headache, dizziness, and
the like. This was a reasonable request,
but it raised a storm in town. Not more
than one parent in ten would send in a
report, and from those who responded
we had an amusing lot of answers. One
man wrote across the blank, None of
this for me. Give my boy more reading
and arithmetic. Another one said his
boys indigestion was very good. In
response to the query, Are the shoul-
ders even? one man said, The right
shoulder is, but the left shoulder is a lit-
tle off. The ancillary expansion of the
children varied from nothing to one hun-
dred inches. In short, the replies were
worthless, and a good scheme was aban-
doned because the public would not
stand such nonsense.
	Some time ago tardiness had proved
to be a great nuisance, and we resolved
to stop it, if we could, by closing the
doors to all tardy pupils. We resolved
to send them back to their homes to get
a written excuse stating the reason for
their being late. We hoped in this way
to reduce the tardiness from five per cent
to one per cent of the attendance. We
thought that an allowance of one per cent
was reasonable. The order was pub-
lished, announcements were duly made
to the pupils, and the fun began. The
very first day that notes were required
a dozen pupils were sent home, and did
not return thateday. The next day they
came with insulting notes from their
parents to the effect that our rules were
tyrannical and illegal. One parent
~vrote, My son was tardy because he
was late; the reason therefor is none of
your business. Others were of like
import. One man rent to the presi-
dent of the board and gave the school
system a sound rating for its rigidity;
the same man had said, a few months
before, that the laxity of discipline was
a disgrace. The board, however, stood
by its rules, and tardiness has almost
disappeared.
	I have found, in my experience of
fifteen years, that some people will abuse
any school official who stands up for
what is best, but that the public will
always respect him for it. Everybody
likes a strong government, and has a
contempt for a weak one. If one wants
to have an easy time and a poor school
system, he need only let things go in
any fashion, and he and his schools will
sleepily drift into general contempt. If
he wants to have a hard time and a good
school system, let him bare his front to
the storm of criticism and abuse, and he</PB>

and his schools will surely win their way
to general respect.

III.

	My experience as superintendent of
schools has been chiefly in two cities,
each having a population of more than
fifty thousand. In character and gen-
eral municipal life these cities may be
said to be polar opposites. In one there
is a high degree of general intelligence,
a good public spirit, a pure city gov-
ernment, and the schools are absolutely
free from those various adverse influ-
ences which are the bane of public schools
in so many cities. The school board is
composed of a high class of citizens, and
the people are loyal to the schools. In
the other city there was, a dozen years
ago, when I knew it, an exceedingly
low grade of intelligence, a low moral
tone, an indifference to schools and to
education in general, and the board was
composed of men the majority of whom
were ignorant, and some of them, it was
well known, were corrupt. I believe
that, during the two years and a half of
my work there, I met with nearly all
the most embarrassing conditions under
which a school superintendent is ever
called to work.
	In this city the board consisted of
fifty-two members,  four from each of
thirteen wards. Since I left it, enough
wards have been created to make the
membership of the board sixty-four.
The members were nominated and elect-
ed by wards, each ward voting only for
its own representatives. The meetings
of the board suggested meetings of the
state legislature, and there were the cau-
cusing, the log-rolling, and the parti-
sanship of a political convention when-
ever questions of importance came up.
There was a sprinkling of intelligent men,
enough to constitute an efficient board;
the rest of the members were men who
could not speak grammatically, and
some of them were known in the com-
munity as men of low morals, who were
not fit to come in contact either with
women teachers or with children in the
schools. I remember that one night at
eleven oclock I saw the president of the
board leaning against a tree at the curb-
stone, so intoxicated that a fellow mem-
ber of the board, who happened to be
with him, had to lead him home. This
was not an unusual occurrence; he was
known as a very dissipated man at the
time he was elected president. He had
the support of a majority of the mem-
bers until his conduct in the meetings
of the board became a public scandal.
The low moral tone of the board was
felt throughout the schools. Teachers
depended on favoritism and political
pulls, instead of on merit, for promo-
tion, and some were kept in their posi-
tions who were not only incompetent, but
also of objectionable character. The
principal of one of the high schools was
known to be untruthful, absolutely un-
trustworthy in money matters, and an
unprincipled man generally; yet he had
the support of a majority of the board
for a number of years.
	By a provision of the city charter the
board consisted of an equal number of
Republicans and Democrats; but instead
of becoming non-partisan under this ar-
rangement, it became bi-partisan. No
teachers not residents of the city could
be elected to positions in the schools be-
low the high schools, and nearly all the
teachers in the high schools were resi-
dents. The appointments were almost
entirely made through favoritism. Po-
litical affiliations, church associations,
and business relations between the
friends of applicants and members of
the board determined appointments to
schools. The term politics as ap-
plied to school affairs is not always
clearly understood. No question is
raised as to the political party to which
a teacher belongs or with which he sym-
pathizes; the only question is whether
his appointment will procure the politi-
cal influence of his friends at the next</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00657" SEQ="0657" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="651">Confessions of Three School Superintendents.	651

election. It ought to be said that church
influence is often more embarrassing to
a superintendent than politics, and I
have myself been hampered by deacons
and pastors in my efforts to do the best
thing for the schools. In the city above
referred to there was a woman at the
head of one of the high schools who was
personally a very estimable woman, but
who was entirely incompetent. The
reason why she could not be removed
was not political. The pastor of one
of the leading churches and one of the
judges of the superior court objected so
strongly to her removal that the board
were afraid to take the step. Ministers,
through a mistaken sympathy, often al-
low themselves to indorse incompetent
teachers, and so help to block the way
for better things in the schools. In fact,
a recommendation of a teacher by her
pastor seldom has any weight whatever.
I usually throw such documents into the
waste-paper basket when applicants send
them to me, unless I am personally ac-
quainted with the minister and know
that he is competent to form a critical
judgment of a teachers work. I have
made confession of a professional secret
which it may do no serious harm to
divulge.
	In the same city, where houses were
erected by the school board and all con-
tracts pertaining to the schools were
awarded by the board, there was a temp-
tation for a certain class of men to seek
election to the board who could not be
tempted into the public service by
any desire to advance the public inter-
est. Some of them secured appoint-
ments upon the building committee.
It was well known that bids for con-
tracts were opened before all bids were
handed in, and pointers were given
to late bidders. Some of these men
were constantly found on the textbook
committee, and agents of publishing
houses had to meet them on ground suffi-
ciently low to reach their official good
will. In a certain book contest, one
young, inexperienced agent told me he
gave one member of the committee
money to take a trip to the seashore.
To gain the good will of another, he
said he accompanied him not only to
saloons, but to worse places. He lost
the contest, and was afterward dis-
charged by the publisher whom he re-
presented. In this contest, another pub-
lisher employed a special agent who was
a politician, and was willing to resort to
means which the regular agent could not
be asked to employ. Much has been
said about corruption in the relations
between publishing houses and school
boards. My observation has been that
it all depends on the moral character of
the board. Publishers will not resort to
means lower than is absolutely neces-
sary to obtain trade, and I have known
some to refuse to have anything to
do with book contests because of the
dishonesty of the textbook committee.
The agents of most of our publishing
houses are college-bred men, high-mind-
ed, and are willing to put their business
on as high a plane as school boards will
permit them. In short, where school
boards are pure, the textbook business
is honorably conducted.
	The first thing to do, therefore, to
elevate and improve the public schools
is to secure a higher grade of people
to serve on school boards. The public
schools of Chicago are a more impor-
tant trust to administer than Chicago
University; lkewise, the public schools
of Philadelphia and of New York are
more important trusts to administer than
either the University of Pennsylvania
or Columbia University; and yet who
would be willing to say that even a
majority of the members of any school
board which these cities have ever had
would be suitable persons to elect as
members of the boards of trustees of
these institutions? Fortunately, there
are always a few men of eminent
worth and good ability on these hoards,
but they seldom constitute a majority.</PB>

A reform cannot be brought about by
moral force alone. Legislation is ne-
cessary. The school systems of most
of our cities require a thorough recon-
struction.
	In the first place, the size of school
boards must be reduced. The number
should rarely exceed one member for
every ten thousand of population, ex-
cept in very small cities. In the large
cities the number should be made con-
siderably less than this. Such reduction
in numbers will be made possible, how-
ever, only by reducing the work now
done gratuitously by members, and giv-
ing it into the hands of paid expert
agents who are to work under the gener-
al supervision of the board. At present,
members of school boards are obliged to
spend a very considerable portion of
their time in attending to details which
can be managed much more efficiently
by paid experts. Business men of un-
usual ability, and of large business inter-
ests of their own to look after, cannot
afford to accept positions on a school
board under existing conditions. The
only way to secure the services of such
men is to relieve the boards of official
details, and to require of them only the
direction of the general policy and work
of the schools.
	In the second place, all ward repre-
sentations in school boards should be
abolished. Every member should be a
member at large and should repre-
sent the whole city. When members
are elected by wards, the local ward poli-
tician dictates the election. A clean
ward will send a good man; a ward
in which the lower element is concen-
trated almost invariably elects a man
who is not suitable for such a position.
The ward politicians, controlling the
ward elections, control later the official
acts of members thus elected. Hence
this system of election is a source of
political corruption of the school board,
and through it of the schools. Nomi-
nation from wards and election at large
produce better results, for the whole city
has a voice at the polls in determining
who shall represeut each ward. But
this method of election is also objection-
able, because in the business wards of
cities of even moderate size it is often
impossible to find a single resident who
is a suitable person to serve on a school
board.
	There is no one method of selecting a
school board that is best for all cities.
In some cities the local conditions are
such that appointment by the mayor is
the best method; in others, like Phil-
adelphia, appointment by the judges of
the courts seems to be fairly satisfac-
tory. In the majority of cities, how-
ever, election by popular ballot is un-
doubtedly the best method.
	In the third place, there should be
an entire separation between the educa-
tional part and the business part of the
administration of the public school sys-
tem in our large cities. There should
be an agent for the business department
and a superintendent of instruction for
the educational department, each of
whom should be directly responsible to
the board.
	In the fourth place, the educational
department should be intrusted more
largely than it has been to the superin-
tendent of instruction. I fail to see a
good reason why there should be a com-
mittee of the board called Committee
on Course of Study. The making of a
course of study is the work of an edu-
cational expert. The more intelligent a
school committee, the more the members
shrink from such a responsibility. Yet in
some of our larger cities the superintend-
ent is barely consulted when the course
of study is to be revised. I see little
occasion, also, for a committee on text-
books. Textbooks should be selected by
the superintendent after free consulta-
tion with the teachers who are to use
them.
	There must be more concentration of
responsibility, and consequently of an-</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00659" SEQ="0659" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="653">Confessions of Three School Superintendents.	653

thority, in the administration of school
affairs. There is probably no other public
official, of equal ability, intelligence, and
character, who has so little real legal
authority as a superintendent of schools.
The mayor of a city, as a rule, has no
more ability, and usually has less educa-
tion, than the superintendent of schools,
and yet he has very much more author-
ity. Likewise the judges of our courts,
with a life tenure, have immensely more
power than men who are their equals
and are engaged in superintending pub-
lic schools. One man power becomes
dangerous only when it is not linked
with one man responsibility.
	In the fifth place, where the school
board is elected directly by the people,
and is therefore directly responsible to
the people, it ought to be financially in-
dependent of the rest of the city gov-
ernment. It ought to have charge not
only of the schools and the teachers, but
also of the schoolhouses and the janitors.
The city council ought to have no au-
thority to determine how much money is
to be spent on schools and school build-
ings. This is the only solution of the
embarrassing problem of securing suffi-
cient school room for the school popula-
tion of our large cities. Cities like New
York, Philadelphia, Buffalo, and Chica-
go fail to build schoolhouses fast enough
to keep pace with the growth of popu-
lation, not because they cannot afford it
or because the taxpayers are unwilling
to be taxed more heavily for such a pur-
pose, but because the politicians in the
city government want the money for
other purposes.
	In the sixth place, I wish there might
be an ordinance in every city providing
that any person who has been a member
of the school board shall be ineligible
to any other city office for two or three
years after his term of office on the
school board expires. In this way, po-
litical favors done while on the school
board could not at once be returned in
some other form, and a position on the
school board could not be made so di-
rectly as at present a stepping-stone into
some higher municipal office. There
are no doubt legal, and in some states
possibly constitutional difficulties in the
way of enacting such an ordinance, but
it would go far toward eliminating am-
bitious politicians from school boards.
	Finally, I desire to say that I have
the good fortune to live in a city in
which the schools are absolutely free
from political influence and from every
other adverse influence; a city in which
there has been no such thing as a COil-
test over textbooks for at least ten
years, in which it takes from five to ten
minutes to vote out an inferior book and
vote in a better one, when a change
seems desirable; a city in which there
is no demand for home talent that
leads to a system of inbreeding which
is the curse of many school systems, but
in which teachers are employed who
come from any part of the country, the
only questions asked being such as re-
late to their qualifications and efficiency.
The superintendent has all the freedom
and power which any one can desire,
and is held, as he should be, strictly re-
sponsible for results.</PB>

	THE bell on the top of the Cohue Roy-
ale clattered like the tongue of a scold-
ing fishwife. For it was the opening
day of the Assise dH6ritage, and the
governor with his suite; the lieutenant-
bailly with his dozen jurats, like so
many parochial apostles; the avocats
with their knowledge of lancien coil-
tume de Normandie and the devious in-
roads made upon it by the customs of
Jersey; the seigneurs and the dames
des fiefs,  all were invited to assemble
at the opening of this court, from which
there was no appeal save to themselves,
or by their own consent to the Kings
Privy Council.
	This particular session of the Cour
dH6ritage was to proceed with unusual
spirit and importance; for after the
Kings proclamation was read, the Royal
Court and the states were to present the
formal welcome of the island to Admiral
Prince Philip dAvranche, Duc de Bercy;
likewise to offer a bounty to every Jersey-
man enlisting under him.
	The island was en fete. There had
not been such a year of sensations since
the battle of Jersey. The breaking out
of the present war with France had been
exciting, but the subsequent duties of
guarding the coast, imposed upon every
able-bodied citizen, proved so monotonous
that the trial and interrupted hanging
of Mattingley, the discovery of Olivier
Delagardes crime and his escape, and
the return of Philip dAvranche had
thrilled the impressionable islanders into
chattering demonstration.
	This 4th of October was to be still
more notable, for a figure quite as re-
markable in the history of Jersey as
Philip dAvranche, and as distinguished
elsewhere, was returning to the island
upon business of importance.
	He was not a native; he was not Eng-
lish. A dissipated stripling of the French
court, he had come to Jersey with the
filibuster Rullecour. He was returning
now upon no business of invasion, but
in pursuit of that justice for some one
else which every Jerseyman is intent to
secure for himself. He had come before
in the night, to spoil and to conquer; he
came now in the open morning, to main-
tain that the things which were Gods
be not given to Ciesar. It was Comte
D6tricand de Tournay.
	A short time before, D6tricand had
chanced to find in the prison of a cap-
tured town in Brittany a clergyman of
England bearing the name of Lorenzo
Dow, who, after four years of confine-
ment, was dying as apathetically as he
had always lived. He had been taken
captive at the breaking out of the war,
had been thrown into prison, and lost
sight of by the British government, as
also by the ravenous French adminis-
tration. When D6tricand discovered
him on his bed of straw in a miserable
dungeon, he was lying calmly asleep,
with his fingers between the leaves of a
book of meditations. He was forthwith
taken to D&#38; ricands own quarters, and
there he died peacefully within a few
days; remarking almost with his last
breath that it was taking advantage of
time to read the New Testament in
translation.
	D6tricand had known Lorenzo Dow
in Jersey, and in their brief conversations
before the sick man died he discussed
many things which troubled and con-
founded him. He learned of the mar-
riage of Guida and Philip, and there
passed into his hands the little black
leather-covered journal which was a re-
cord of the life of Lorenzo Dow in Jer-
sey and elsewhere. In this book were
the details of the fateful marriage.</PB></P>

upon business of importance.
	He was not a native; he was not Eng-

	D6tricand had buried Lorenzo Dow,
and then in a lull of warfare had set out
in search of Philip dAvranche. Before
he did so, however, he had had a se-
cret meeting, under truce, with General
Graudjon - Larisse, of the Republican
army, to whom he told the story of
Guida and Philip. From that moment
Graudjon-Larisse and D6tricand had an
office of honor to perform, but the former
must first proceed to Paris on business
pertaining to the army; and thus it hap-
pened that D6tricand alone, after four
years of famous service in a hopeless
war, returned to Jersey to find Philip
dAvranche.
	During every hour that passed be-
tween his secretly leaving Grandjon-
Larisse at Angers and his reaching
Roque Platte, where he had landed, an
invader, so many years before, his in-
dignant strength of purpose grew. Im-
mediately he set foot on Jersey, with an
officer attached to his person and two
soldiers of his legion he proceeded to the
Church of St. Michaels, where the mar-
riage of Philip and Guida had been per-
formed. There, to his consternation, he
learned that the register of births, mar-
riages, and deaths had long since disap-
peared.
	So far as he knew, the only record
left was the little black journal got from
the Reverend Lorenzo Dow. This was
now in his own pocket.
	Returning to the town, and skirting it
to avoid observation, D~tricand came up
th~ Rue des Sablons, intending to seek
Elie Mattingley and the Chevalier dii
Champsavoys at the house in the Rue
dEgypte; but as he passed, seeing the
house of Jean Touzel, he dismounted,
knocked, and, not waiting to be admit-
ted, entered.
	Maitresse Aimable did not keep her
seat, as she had done on Philips en-
trance, a few days before. She rose
slowly, a smile lighting her face that
but now was clouded, and made essay to
curtsy. Maitresse Aimable knew well
whom she should honor herself in honor-
ing, and the red cross and red heart of
the Vend~e on the chieftains coat wiped
out in her mind any doubtful memory
of the idle, hard-drinking Savary dit
D6tricand, and established this new D6-
tricand in her favor.
	From Aimables mouthpiece, Jean, he
learned all: what had chanced to Mat-
tingley and Carterette, to Ranulph and
his father, everything concerning Guida
and her child, and of to-days proceed-
ings at the Cour dH4ritage. The tale
had scarce been told when the bell of the
court-house began to ring.

	Long before chicane-chicane clanged
out over the ~Tier Marchi the body of
the court was filled. The lieutenant-
governor, the lieutenant - bailly, the
jurats, the military, arrived and took
their places; the officers of the navy ar-
rived,  all save one, and he was to be
the chief figure of this function. With
each arrival the people cheered and the
trumpets blared. The crowds in the
Vier Marchi turned to the booths for
refreshment, or to the printing-machine
set up by La Pyramide, and bought half-
penny chap-sheets telling of recent de-
feats of the French,  though mostly
they told in ebullient words of the sea
fight which had made Philip dAvranche
an admiral, and of his elevation to a
sovereign dukedom.
	Since the battle of Jersey the Vier
Marchi had not been so full or so tumult-
uous, yet the scene lacked some old ele-
ments of picturesqueness. Long familiar
things were absent. Men had been ac-
customed to find a lounging-place near
Carterettes booth, women near her fa-
thers great oak chest; and the distorted
figure of Dormy Jamais, winding in and
out of the crowd with a fools wisdom
on his lips, was missed in the general
movement. It was as though La Pyra-
mide itself had been suddenly spirited
away during the night by some pitying
genius of sculpture. and Norman feet</PB>

were as yet restless on the spot where it
had stood.
	Inside the court there was more rest-
lessness still. The Comtesse Chantavoine
was in her place of honor beside the
attorney-general, but Admiral the Duc
de Bercy had not yet arrived. It was
now many minutes beyond the hour
fixed. The licutenant-bailly whispered
to the governor, the governor to his aide,
and the aide sought naval officers pre-
sent; but these could give no explana-
tion of the delay. Prince Philip and
his flag-lieutenant came not.
	The greffler was indignant, the greffler
was imperious, the greffler was disgusted;
the greffler wrote down what would ap-
pear to be sentences of imprisonment
and fines, direful penalties against the
princely delinquent. The greffler looked
round him fiercely. In one of these
fierce scoutings he encountered the still,
impassive face of the Cointesse Chanta-
voine, her eyes fixed calmly upon him;
and, reduced to his natural stature again,
he dropped back suddenly in his huge
chair,  a small swallow in a vast sum-
mer.
	The Comtesse Chantavoine was the
one person outwardly unmoved. What
she thought who could tell? Hundreds
of eyes scanned her face, and she seemed
unconscious of them, indifferent to them.
What would not the lieutenant-bailly
have given for her calmness! What
would not the greffler have given for
her importance! She drew every eye
by virtue of something which was more
than the name of Duchesse de Bercy.
The face of the Comtesse Chantavoine
had an unconscious and indefinable dig-
nity, a living command and composure,
the heritage, perhaps, of a race who had
ever been more fighters than courtiers,
used to danger, more desiring good sleep
after good warfare done than luxurious
peace. She did not move her head, but
her look seemed to be everywhere and
yet nowhere; hers was the educated eye.
She saw, as it were, the bailly at one
end of the room, and the door by which
Prince Philip should enter at the other.
She saw the greffler, which disconcerted
him; yet she did not see him, and she
was not disconcerted.
	The silence, the tension, grew painful.
A whole half hour had the court waited
beyond the appointed time. At last,
however, cheers arose outside, and all
knew that the prince had come. Pre-
sently the doors were thrown open, two
halberdiers stepped inside, and an officer
of the court announced Admiral his Se-
rene Highness Prince Philip dAvranche,
Duc de Bercy.
	Oni-gia, think of that! said a voice
from somewhere in the hall.
	Prince Philip heard it, and he frowned,
for he recognized the voice as that of
Dormy Jarnais. Where it came from
he knew not, nor could any one else see;
for Dormy Jamais was snugly bestowed
above a middle doorway in what was
half balcony, half cornice.
	All present rose to their feet as Philip
advanced, save the governor, the lieu-
tenant-bailly, and the jurats. When he
had taken his seat beside the Comtesse
Chantavoine, there came the formal open-
ing of the Cour dH6ritage.
	The comtesses eyes fixed themselves
upon Philip. There was that in his
manner which puzzled and evaded her
clear, searching intuition. Some strange
circumstance must have delayed him;
for she saw that his flag-lieutenant was
disturbed, and this, she felt sure, was
not due to unpunctuality alone. She
was hardly conscious that the lieutenant-
bailly had been addressing Philip, until
he had stopped and Philip had risen.
	He had scarcely begun speaking when
the doors were thrown open again, and
a woman came quickly forward. It
was Guida. The instant she entered
Philip saw her and stopped speaking.
Every one turned. In the silence,
Guida, looking neither to right nor
to left, advanced almost to where the
greffier sat, and dropping on her knee</PB>

and looking up to the lientenant-bailly
and the jurats, stretched out her hands
and cried that cry which is more to
a Jerseyman than Allah to a Moham-
medan 
Haro, haro! ~ laide, mon prince,
on mefait tort!
	If one rose from the dead suddenly
to command them to an awed obedience,
Jerseymen could not be more at the
mercy of the apparition than at the call
of one who cried in their midst, Haro,
haro!  that ancient relic of the cus-
tom of Normandy and Rollo the Dane.
Whoso needed justice, whoso was tres-
passed upon in mind, body, or estate,
sought Rollo wherever he might be, 
in the highway, or at his prayers, or on
the field of battle, or among the great
of the land,  and falling upon a knee
cried to him, Haro, haro! ii laide,
mon prince, on me fait tort!
	To this hour, whoso in Jersey is tres-
passed on in estate maketh his cry unto
Rollo, and the Royal Court  whose
right to respond to this cry was con-
firmed by King John, and afterward by
King Charles  must listen, and every
one must heed. That cry of Haro will
make the workman drop his tools, the
woman her knitting, the militiaman his
musket, the fisherman his net, the school-
master his birch, and the 4crivain his
babble, to await the judgment of the
Royal Court.
	Every jurat fixed his eyes upon Guida
as though she had come to claim his
life. The lieutenant-baillys lips opened
twice as though to speak, but at first no
words came. The governor sat with
hands clenched upon his chair-arm. The
breath of the crowd came in gasps of
excitement. The Comtesse Chantavoine
looked at Philip, looked at Guida, and
knew that here was the opening of the
scroll she had not been able to unfold.
Now she should understand that some-
thing which had made the old Duc de
Bercy with his last breath say, Dont
be afraid!
	VOL. LXXXII.  NO. 493.	42
	Philip stood moveless, his eyes steady,
his face bitter, determined. Yet there
was in his look, fixed upon Gaida, some
strange mingling of pity and tenderness.
It was as though two spirits were fight-
ing in his face for mastery. The Coin-
tesse Chantavoine touched him upon the
arm, but he took no notice. Drawing
back in her seat, she thenceforth looked
at him and at Guida as one might watch
the balances of justice in weighing life
and death. She could not read this
story, but one look at the faces of the
crowd round her made her aware that
here was a tale of the past which they
all knew in little or in much.
	Haro, haro! i~ laide, mon prince,
on me fait tort!  What did she mean,
this woman with the exquisite face, alive
with power and feeling, and indignation
and appeal? To what prince did she
cry,  for what aid? Who trespassed
upon her?
	The hieutenant-bailly now stood up, a
frown upon his face. He knew what
scandal had said concerning Guida and
Philip. He had never liked Guida, for
in the first days of his importance as
lieutenant-bailly, because of a rudeness
upon his part, meant as a compliment,
she had thrown his hat  the hieuten-
ant-baillys hat!  into the Fauxbie by
the Vier Prison. He thought her intru-
sive thus to stay the proceedings of the
Royal Court, with distinguished visitors
present, by an appeal for he knew not
what. But the law of Haro takes pre-
cedence of all else.
	What is the trespass, and who is
the trespasser?  asked the bailly stern-
ly, and forthwith took his seat.
	Guida rose to her feet now.
	Philip dAvranche has trespassed,
she said.
	What Philip dAvranche, mademoi-
selle? asked the bailly, in a rough, un-
generous tone.
	She flashed upon him a look of con-
tempt, and answered, Admiral Philip
dAvranche, known as his Serene High-</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00664" SEQ="0664" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="658">	658	The Battle of the Strong.
ness the Due de Bercy, has trespassed
on me.
	She did not look at Philip; her eyes
were fixed upon the bailly and the ju-
rats.
	The bailly whispered to one or two
~urats.
	Wherein is the trespass? he asked
sharply. Tell your story.
	After an instants painful pause Guida
told her tale.
	Last night, at Plernont, she said, in
a voice trembling a little at first, but
growing stronger as she went on, I
left my child, my Guilbert, in his bed,
with Dormy Jamais to watch beside him,
while I went to my boat which lies a half
mile from my hut. I left Dormy Jamais
with the child because I was afraid  be-
cause I have been afraid these three days
past  that Philip dAvranche would
steal him from me. I was gone but half
an hour; it was dark when I returned.
I found the door open. I found Dormy
Jamais lying upon the floor unconscious,
and my childs bed empty. He was
gone, my child, my Guilbert! He was
stolen from me by Philip dAvranche,
Due de Bercy.
	What proof have you that it was the
Due de Bercy?
	I have told your honor that Dormy
Jamais was there. He struck Dormy
Jamais to the ground, and rode off with
my child.
	The bailly sniffed. Dormy Jamais
is a simpleton, an idiot.
Let Prince Philip dAvranche speak,
she answered quickly. Half an hour
ago I met him as I was on my way to
his Castle of Mont Orgueil. He did
not d9ny it then; he dare not deny it
now.
	She turned and looked Philip in the
eyes. He did not answer a word. He
had not moved since she entered the
court-room. He had kept his eyes fixed
on her save for one or two swift glances
toward the jurats. The crisis of his life
had come. He was ready to meet it
now: anything would be better than all
he had gone through during the past ten
days. In a moments mad impulse he
had stolen the child, in the wild belief
that through it he could reach Guida,
could bring her to him. For now this
woman who despised him, hated him, he
desired more than all else in the world.
Ambition has its own means of punish-
ing. For its own gifts of place or for-
tune it puts some impossible hunger in
the soul of its victim which leads him
at last to his own destruction. With all
the world conquered there is still some
mystic island of which it whispers, and
to gain this its devotee risks all  and
loses all.
	The bailly saw by Philips look that
Guida had spoken the truth. But he
whispered to the jurats eagerly, and
presently said with brusque decision,
Our law of Haro may only apply to
trespass upon property. Its intent is
merely civil.
	Having said this, he opened and shut
his mouth with gusto, and sat back as
though expecting Guida to retire.
	 Your law of Haro, Monsieur le
Bailly! Guida answered, with a flash
of her eyes and her voice ringing out
fearlessly. Your law of Haro! The
law of Haro comes from the custom of
Normandy, which is the law of Jersey.
You make its intent this, you make it
that, but nothing can alter it and what
has been done in its name for genera-
tions. Is it so, then, that if Philip
dAvranche trespasses upon my land or
my hearth, I may cry Haro, haro! and
you will take heed; but when it is blood
of my blood, bone of my bone, flesh of
my flesh, that he has wickedly seized,
when it is the head which I have pil-
lowed on my breast for three years,  a
child who has known no father, a child
who has been his mothers only compan-
ion in her shame, the shame of an out-
cast,  then is it so that your law of
Haro may not apply? No, no, mes-
sieurs; it is the justice of Haro that I</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00665" SEQ="0665" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="659">	The Battle of the Strong.	659

ask, not your lax usage of it. From
this Prince Philip I appeal to the spirit
of that prince of Normandy who made
this law,  I appeal to the law of Jer-
sey which comes from the law of Rollo.
There are precedents enough, as you
know well, messieurs. I demand of you
my child,  I demand!
	The bailly and the jurats were in a
hopeless quandary. They glanced fur-
tively at Philip. They were half afraid
that she was right, and yet were timor-
ous of deciding against the prince-ad-
miral.
	She saw their hesitation. I ask
you to fulfill the law. I have cried
Haro, haro! and what I have cried men
will hear outside this court, outside this
Isle of Jersey; for I cry it against a sov-
ereign duke of Europe.
	The bailly and the jurats were over-
whelmed by the situation. Guidas
brain was a thousand times clearer than
theirs. Danger, peril to her child, had
aroused in her every force of intelli-
gence; she had the daring, the desper-
ation, of the lioness fighting for her own.
	Philip himself solved the problem.
Turning to the bench of jurats, he said
quietly, She is quite right: the law of
Haro is with her; it must apply.
	The court was in a greater maze than
ever. Was he then about to restore
to Guida her child?
	After an instants pause Philip con-
tinued: But in this case there was no
trespass  for the child  is my own.
	Every eye in the Cohue Royale fixed
itself upon him, then upon Guida, then
upon her who was known as the Du-
chesse de Bercy. The face of the Coin-
tesse Chantavoine was like marble, white
and cold. As the words fell from Phil-
ips lips a sigh hroke from her own, and
there came to Philips mind that distant
day in the council-chamber at Bercy,
when for one moment he was upon his
trial; but he did not turn and look at
her now. It was all pitiable, horrible,
but this open avowal, insult as it was to
the Cointesse Chantavoine, could be no
worse than the rumors which would
surely have reached her one day. So
let the game fare on. He had thrown
down the glove now, and he could not
see the end; he was playing for one
thing only,  for the woman he had lost,
for his own child. If everything went
by the board, why, it must go by the
board. It all flashed through his brain:
To-morrow he must send in his resigna-
tion to the Admiralty,  so much at once.
Then France  the dukedom of Bercy
 whatever happened, there was work
for him to do at Bercy. He was a sov-
ereign duke of Europe, as Guida had
said. He would fight for the duchy for
his sons sake. Standing there, he could
feel again the warm cheek of the child
upon his own as last night he felt it, rid-
ing across the island from Plemont to
Mont Orgueil. That very morning he
had hurried down to a cottage at the
foot of the cliff at Grouville Bay, and
seen the boy lying still asleep in a little
bed, well cared for by a woman of the
village. He knew that to-morrow the
scandal of the thing would belong to
the world. He had tossed his fame as
an admiral into the gutter, but Bercy
was left. All the native force, the stub-
born vigor, the obdurate spirit of the
soil of Jersey of which he was, its arro-
gant self-will, drove him straight into
this last issue.
	But he stopped short in his thoughts,
for there now at the court-room door
stood D6tricand, Comte de Tournay!
	Philip drew his hand quickly across
his eyes,  it seemed so wild, so fantas-
tic, that of all men D6tricand should be
there. His gaze was so fixed that every
one turned to see,  every one save
Guida.
	She was not aware of this new figure
in the scene. In her heart there was
tumult. Her hour had come at last, 
the hour in which she must declare that
she was the wife of this man. She had
no proofs, and no doubt he would deny</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00666" SEQ="0666" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="660">	660	The Battle of the Strong.

it now; for he knew how she loathed
him. But she would tell her tale.
	She was about to address the bailly,
but, as though a pang of pity shot
through her heart, she turned instead
and looked at the Comtesse Chantavoine.
She could find it in her soul to pause in
compassion for this poor lady, more
wronged than herself. Their eyes met.
One instants flash of intelligence be-
tween the souls of two women, and
Guida knew that the look of the Corn-
tesse Charitavoine had said, Speak for
your child.
	Thereupon she spoke.
	Messieurs, Prince Philip dAvranche
is my husband, she said to the jurats.
	Every one in the court-room stirred
with excitement. A weak-nerved wo-
man in the crowd, with a child at her
breast, began to cry, and the little one
joined its feeble wail to hers.
Four years ago, Guida continued,
I was married to Philip dAvranche
by the Reverend Lorenzo Dow in the
Church of St. Michaels 
The bailly interrupted with a grunt.
Hm! Lorenzo Dow is well out of the
way. Have done.
	May I not then be heard in my
own defense? Guida went on, with in-
dignation. Four years I have suffered
silently slander and shame. Now I
speak for myself at last  and you will
not hear me. I come to this court of
justice, and my word is doubted ere I
can prove the truth! Is it for judges
to assail one so? Four years ago I was
married secretly in the chapel of St.
Michaels,  secretly, because Philip
dAvranche urged it, pleaded for it.
An open marriage, he said, would injure
his promotion. We were wedded, and
he left me. War broke out. I re-
mained silent, according to my promise
to him. Then came the time when, in
the states of Bercy, he denied that be
had a wife. From the hour I knew he
had done so I denied him. My child
was born in shame and sorrow. I my-
self was an outcast from among you alL
But my conscience was clear before
Heaven. I took myself and my child
out from among you to Plemont. I
waited, believing that Gods justice is
surer than mans. At last Philip
dAvranche  my husband  returned
here. He invaded my home,~and begged
me to come to him as his wife with my
child,  he who had so evilly wronged
me, and wronged another more than me.
I refused. Then he stole my child from
me. You ask for proofs of my mar-
riage. Messieurs, I have no proofs. I
know not where Lorenzo Dow may be
found. The register of St. Michaels
Church, as you all know, was stolen. Mr.
Shoreham, who witnessed the marriage,
was drowned. But you must believe me.
There is one witness left, if he will but
tell the truth,  even the man who mar-
ried me, the man who for one day called
me his wife. I ask him now to tell the
truth!
	Her clear eyes pierced Philip through
and through.
	What was going on in Philips mind
neither she nor any in that court might
ever know; for in the pause the Coin-
tesse Chantavoine rose up, and passing
steadily by Philip came to Guida. Look-
ing her in the eyes with an incredible
sorrow, she took her hand, and turned
toward Philip with infinite scorn.
	A strange, thrilling silence fell upon
all the court. The jurats shifted in
their seats with excitement. The bailly,
in a hoarse, dry voice, said, We must
have proof. There must be record as
well as witness.
	From the body of the hall there came
a voice, The witiiess and record are
here! and D6tricand stepped forward,
in his uniform of the army of the Yen-
d6e.
	A hushed murmur ran round the
room. The jurats whispered to one an-
other.
	Who are you, monsieur? said the
bailly.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00667" SEQ="0667" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="661">	The Battle of the Strong.	661

	I am DStricand, Prince of Vaufon-
tame, he replied,  for whom the
Comtesse Chantavoine will vouch, he
added in a pained voice, and bowed low
to her and to Guida.
	He did not wait for the bailly to an-
swer, but told of the death of Lorenzo
Dow, and, taking from his pocket the
little black journal, opened it and read
aloud the record written there by the
dead clergyman. Having read it, he
passed the book to the greffier, who hand-
ed it up to the bailly. A moments pause
ensued. To the most ignorant and
casual of the onlookers the strain of it
was great; to those chiefly concerned it
was supreme. rhe lieutenant-bailly and
the jurats whispered together, and now
at last a spirit of justice was roused in
them. But the laws technicalities were
still to rule.
	The bailly closed the book, and handed
it back to the greffier with the words,
This is not proof, though it is evi-
dence.
	Guida felt her heart sink within her.
The Comtesse Chantavoine, who still
held her hand, pressed it, though she
herself was cold as ice with sickness of
spirit.
	At that instant, and from Heaven
knows where,  as a bird comes from a
bush,  a little gray man came quickly
among them all, carrying spread open
before him a book almost as big as him-
self. Handing it up to the bailly, he
said, Here is the proof, Monsieur le
Bailly,  here is the whole proof.
	The bailly leaned over and drew up
the book. The jurats crowded near,
and a dozen heads gathered about the
open volume.
	At last the bailly looked up, and ad-
dressed the court solemnly.
	It is the lost register of St. Mi-
chaels. It contains a record of the mar-
riage of Guida Landresse de Landresse
and Lieutenant Philip dAvranche, both
of the Isle of Jersey.
	Exactly so. exactly so. said the lit-
tle gray figure, the Chevalier Orvillier
du Champsavoys de Beaumanoir. Tears
ran down his cheeks as he turned toward
Guida, but he was smiling too.
	Guidas eyes were upon the bailly.
And the child? she cried, with a
broken voice,  the child?
	The child goes with his mother,
answered the bailly firmly.


XXXIX.

	The day that saw Guidas restitution
in the Cohue Royale brought but further
trouble to Ranulph Delagarde. Intend-
ing to join D~tricand at the headquarters
of the army of the Vend~e, he landed at
St. Malo, and was about to go on to
Quiberon, where Sombreuil was making
his last stand against the soldiers of
Hoche, when he was seized by a press-
gang and carried aboard a French f rig-
ate commissioned to ravage the coasts
of British North America. He had
stubbornly resisted the press, but had
been knocked on the head, and there was
an end of it. In vaiii he protested that
he was an Englishman. They laughed
at him. His French was perfect, his
accent was Norman, his was a Norman
face,  that was evidence enough. If he
was not a citizen of France, lie should
be, and he must be. Ranulph decided
that it was needless to throw away his
life, and ignominious to be hung from
the yard-arm. It was better to make a
show of submission, and so long as he
had not to fight British ships he could
afford to wait. Time enough then for
him to take action. So he was carried
away on the Victoire, which sailed the
seas looking for ships to fight.
	His heart was heavy enough, in truth,
 an exile from his own land, banished
from all early hopes, ambitions, and affec-
tions. As the son of a traitor he had no
longer heart to call himself a Jerseyman.
His childhood had been embittered, his
manhood poisoned. He had borne four</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00668" SEQ="0668" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="662">	662	The Battle of the Strong.
years of an incredible torture, face to
face with his fathers presence and his
fathers hidden crime. He had hoped
to lose himself in the great struggle
between the Royalists and the Red Gov-
ernment, and to find a decent exit on
the battlefield, or to deaden the ago-
nies of his life by reviving his old ener-
gies. But even that had been denied
him, and here he was, forced into serv-
ing a country he had been brought up to
loathe.
	Yet there was one comfort in it all:
his father had been saved the shame
of an ignominious death at the hands of
the law, and he himself now was free
and alone. Just over thirty, he was not
too old to begin the world again. In
the land whither Mattingley and Car-
terette had gone perhaps there was a
field for work, and one might forget
there as easily as in fighting with the
peasants of the Vend~e. In any case, it
was his duty to bear up against evil for-
tune, to endure his present state, and,
when the chance came, to escape from
this bondage. So when lie was pressed
he thought of his four years service with
the artillery at Elizabeth Castle, and
asked to be made a gunner. The impul-
sive and choleric Richambean, captain of
the Victoire, who loved strong men, 
and strong jokes,  believing Ranulphs
story, though professing to disbelieve it,
thought it a noble jest to set an English-
man fighting English ships. Thereupon
he made a gunner of Ranulph, and kept
an eye upon him.
	The Victoire sailed the seas, battle-
hungry, and presently appeased her ap-
petite among Dutch and Danish priva-
teers. Such excellent work did Ranulph
against the Dutchmen, whom he vaguely
knew to be enemies of England, that
Richambeau, delighted, gave him a gun
for himself, and after they had fought
the Danes made him a master gunner.
	Of the largest gun on the Victoire
Ranulph grew inordinately fond. He
had a genius for mechanism, and he
begged from an English-speaking Datch
prisoner a seamans vade-mecum and
a book of defensive war at sea, and dili-
gently studied the art of naval warfare.
Meanwhile, the great gun, a 32-pound-
er, won its way deeper into his affections,
till at last he called it ma couzaine.
	The days and weeks passed, and then,
after some actions against non-British
privateers, wherein the Victoire was all-
victorious and ma couzaine did her duty
well, they neared the coast of America.
One morning came the cry of Land!
Land! and once again Ranulph saw
British soil,  the tall cliffs of the pe-
ninsula of Gasp~. Gasp6,  that name
had been familiar to him since his child-
hood. How many hundreds of Jersey-
men had gone to and from Gasp6! It
was like the other end of the world, to
which all Jerseymen, if they would be
called travelers, must go; it was the
ultima thule to which Mattingley and
Carterette had gone!
	The Victoire and her flotilla came
nearer and nearer to the coast. There
was no British ship in sight, no sign of
fleet or defense; only the tall cliffs and
infinite acreage of land beyond the mouth
of the great St. Lawrence Gulf. Pre-
sently he could see a bay and a great
rock in the distance; and as they bore
in now directly for the bay, the great
rock seemed to stretch out like a vast
wall into the gulf. As he stood watch-
ing and leaning on ma couzaine, a sailor
near him said that the bay was Perc6,
and the rock was Perc6 Rock.
	Perc6 Rock! Since he was a child
Ranulph had heard of Perc6 Rock. And
Perc~ Bay,  that was the exact point
for which Ehie Mattingley and Carterette
had sailed with Sebastian Alixandre.
How strange it was! Not long ago he
had bidden Carterette good-by forever,
had put her aside with his old life, yet
fate had now brought him to the very
spot whither she had gone. After all,
was it then so that mans fate is never
in his own hands; that as it shall please</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00669" SEQ="0669" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="663">	The Battle of the Strong.	663

Heaven he must be tossed like a ball into
the garden made with his own hands, or
across the seas into the vast far coun-
try?
	The Rock of Perc6 was a wall, and
the wall was an island that had once
been a long promontory like a battle-
ment, jutting out hundreds of yards into
the gulf. At one point it was pierced
by an archway. Its sides were al-
most sheer; its top was flat and level.
Upon the sides there was no verdure;
upon the top centuries had made a green
field. The wild geese as they flew north-
ward, myriad flocks of gulls, gannets,
cormorants, and all manner of fowl of
the sea, had builded upon the summit,
until it was now rich with grass and
shrubs. The nations of the air sent their
legions here to bivouac. The discord
of a hundred languages might be heard
far out to sea, far in upon the land.
Millions of the feathered races swarmed
there; at times the air above was dark-
ened by clouds of them. No fog-bell on
a rock-bound coast might warn mari-
ners more ominously than these battal-
ions of adventurers on the Perc6 Rock.
	No human being had ever mounted to
this eyrie or scaled the bulwarks of this
feathered Eden. Three hundred feet
below ship-builders might toil and fish-
ermen hover, but the lofty home of the
marauders of the air had not yet suf-
fered the invasion of man. As the
legend ran, this mighty palisade had
once been a bridge of rock stretched
across the gulf, builded by the gods of
the land, who smote with granite arms
and drove back ruined the appalling gods
of the sea.
	Generations of fishermen had looked
upon the yellowish-red limestone of the
Perc~ Rock with valorous eyes, but it
would seem that not even the tiny cling-
ing hoof of a chamois or wild goat might
find a foothold upon the straight sides
of it. Three hundred feet was a long
way to climb, hand over hand; so for
centuries the Perc6 Rock in the wide
St. Lawrence Gulf remained solitary and
unconquered.
	On most men who had seen it Perc~
Rock made its own impression of mys-
tery; upon Ranulph that impression was
deeper than on most. He was roused
out of the spell it cast upon him only by
seeing suddenly the British flag upon
a building by the shore of the bay they
were now entering. His heart gave a
great bound. He involuntarily looked
up at the French tricolor flying over-
head. It was curious that there should
be such a difference in two pieces of
bunting. (Or was it silk? No, it was
bunting.) Just a little different arrange-
ment in color, and yet the flag on the
building by the shore roused his pulses
to a heat. Yes, there was the English
flag defiantly flying; and what was more,
there were two old 12-pounders being
trained on the French squadron. For
the first time in years a laugh of rolling
good humor burst from his lips.
	Oh my good! Oh mai grand doux!
he said in the Jersey patois. Only one
man in the world would do that,  only
Elie Mattingley!
	It was undoubtedly ridiculous, these
two 12-pounders training on a whole
fleet. Presently came more defiance,
for there was run up beneath the Brit-
ish flag an oblong piece of white linen
with two diagonal red stripes. That
was the flag of Jersey. Now beyond
any doubt Elie Mattingley was in Perc~
Bay.
	As though to prove Ranulph right,
Mattingley issued from a wooden fish-
ing-shed with Sebastian Alixandre and
three others armed with muskets, and
passed to the little fort on which flew the
British and Jersey flags. As Ranulph
looked on, at once amazed and amused,
he heard a guffaw behind him. Turning
round, he suddenly straightened himself
and stood at attention. Richambeau,
the captain, had confronted him.
	That s a big splutter in a little pot,
gunner, said he. He put his telescope</PB>

to his eye. The Lord protect us. he
cried, they re going to fight my squad-
ron! He laughed again till the tears
came. Son of Peter, but it is droll,
that,  a farce au diable! They have
humor, these fislierfolk, eh, gunner?
	Mattingley will fight, just the same,
answered Ranuiph coolly.
	Oh, oh, you know these people, my
gunner? asked Richambean.
	All my life, replied Ranulph, and,
by your leave, I will tell you how.
	Not waiting for permission, after the
manner of his country, he told Richam-
beau again of his Jersey birth and bring-
ing-up and of .his being pressed.
	Very good, remarked Richambeau.
You Jersey folk were once French-
men, and now that you re French again
you shall do something for the flag.
You see that 12-pounder yonder be-
hind the wall? Very well, dismount it.
Then we 11 send in a flag of truce, and
parley with this iMiattingley; for his jests
are worth our attention and politeness.
There s a fellow at tIme gun  no, lie has
gone. Take good aim, and dismount the
right-hand gun at one shot. Ready now,
 you have a good range.
	The whole matter went through Ra-
nulphs mind as the captain spoke. If
he refused to fire, lie would be strung
up to the yard-arm. If he fired and
missed, perhaps other gunners would
fire; and once started they might raze
the fishing-post. If he dismounted the
gun, the matter would probably remain
only a jest, for as such Richambean re-
garded it as yet.
	There was no time to weigh the mat-
ter further; Richambeau was frowning.
So Ranulph smiled, as though the busi-
ness was pleasing to him, and prepared
to fire. He ordered the tackle and
breechings cast away, had off the apron,
pricked a cartridge, primed, bruised the
priming, and covered the vent. Then
he took his range, steadily, quietly.
There was a brisk wind blowing from
the sonth~  he must allow for that: but
the wind was stopped somewhat in its
course by the Perc6 Rock,  he must al-
low for that. He got what he thought
was the right elevation; the distance
was considerable, but he believed that
he could do the business. He had a
cool head, and his eye was quick and ac-
curate.
	All was ready. Suddenly a girl ap-
peared running round the corner of the
building.
	It was Carterette! She was making
for the right-hand gun, Sebastian Ahix-
andre was going toward the other. Ra-
nulph started; the hand that held the
match trembled.
	Fire, you fool, or you 11 kill the
girl! cried Richambeau.
	Ranulph laid a hand on himself, as it
were. Every nerve in his body tingled,
his legs trembled, but his eye was steady.
He took the sight once more coolly, then
blew on the match. Now the girl was
within thirty feet of the gun.
	He quickly blew on the match again,
and fired.
	When the smoke cleared away he saw
that the gun was dismounted, and not
ten feet from it stood Carterette looking
(lazedly at it.
	He heard a laugh behind him: there
was Richambeau walking away, telescope
under arm. Presently Ranulph saw a
boat lowered from the Victoire, even as
the 12-pounder on shore replied impu-
dently to the shot he had fired. The
officers were laughing with Richambeau,
and jerking their heads and fingers to-
ward Ranulph.
	A good shot! he heard Richiam-
beau say.
	Was it, then, said Ranulph to him-
self,  was it, indeed? Bk sfl, it was
the last shot I will ever fire against aught
English, here or elsewhere.
	Looking over the side, he saw a boat
drawing away with the flag of truce in
the hands of a sons - lieutenant. His
mind was made up: he would escape to-
night. His place was there beside his</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00671" SEQ="0671" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="665">	The Battle qf the Strong.	665

fellow countrymen. He turned to ma
couzaine. It would be something of a
wrench for him to leave her; for she
had been a good friend to him at a bad
time in his life. He motioned away the
men of the gun. He would load ma
couzaine for the last time.
	As he sponged the gun he made his
plans. Swish-swash the sponge-staff
ran in and out,  he would try to steal
away at dog-watch. He struck the
sponge smartly on ma couzaines muzzle,
cleansing it,  he would have to slide
into the water like a rat, and swim very
softly to the shore. He took a fresh
cartridge, and thrust it into the throat
of ma couzaine as far as he could reach;
and as he laid the seam downwards he
said to himself that he could swim under
water, if discovered as he left the Vic-
toire. He lovingly placed the wad to
the cartridge, and with three strokes of
the hammer drove wad and cartridge
home with the precision of a drill. It
was a long swim to shore, but he thought
if he got a fair start he could do it. As
he unstopped the touch - hole and tried
with the priming-wire whether the car-
tridge was home, he pictured to himself
being challenged, perhaps by Carterette,
and his reply. Then he imagined how
she would say, Oh my good! in true
Jersey fashion, and then  well, he had
not yet thought beyond that point.
	By the time he had rammed home
wad and shot, however, he had come
upon a fresh thought, and it stunned
him. Richambeau would send a squad
of men to search for him, and if he was
not found they would probably raze the
post. As he put the apron carefully on
ma couzaine, he determined that lie could
not takc refuge with the Mattingleys.
Neither would it do to make for the
woods of the interior, for still Richam-
beau might revenge himself on the fish-
ing-post. This was not entirely to be
wondered at, for ma couzaine would
never behave so well with any one else.
She had been used to playing ngly pranks
when it was blowing fresh. She had
once torn her tackle out of the ring-bolt
in the deck, and had killed more than
one sailor in her mad debauch of free-
dom. Under his hand she had always
behaved well, and it seemed to him that
whenever he blew on the match her
muzzle gaped in a grin of delight. De-
cidedly, he must not go to the Matting-
leys. No harm should come to them
that lie could prevent. What was to be
done?
	Leaning his arms on the gun, he
turned his head and looked helplessly
away from the land. All at once his
look seemed to lose itself in a long aisle
of ever widening, ever brightening
arches, till a vast wilderness of splendor
swallowed it. It was a hole in the wall,
	the archway piercing the great rock.
He raised his eyes to the rock. Its
myriad inhabitants shrieked and clat-
tered and circled overhead. The shot
from ma couzaine had roused them, and
they had risen like a cloud, and were
scolding like a million fishwives over
this insult to their peace.
	As Ranulph looked, a new idea came
to him. If only he could get to the top
of that massive wall, not a hundred
fleets could dislodge him. One musket
could defeat the forlorn hope of any
army. He would be the first man who
ever gave battle to a fleet. Besides, if
he took refuge on the rock, there could
be no grudge against Perc~ village or
the Mattingleys, and Richambean would
not attack them.
	He had worked it out. It was now a
question between himself and Richam-
beau. There on the shore was the young
sous-licutenant with his flag of truce.
talking to Mattingley; they were all
shaking hands. He must carry on the
campaign independent of the Matting-
leys. The one thing to do was to try
to climb the rock. He eyed it closely.
The blazing sunshine showed it up in a
hard light, and lie studied every square
yard of it with a telescope. At one</PB>

point the wall was not quite perpendicu-
lar, and there were narrow ledges, lumps
of stone, natural steps, and little pinna-
cles, which the fingers could grip and
where a man might rest. The weather
had been scorching hot, too, the rocks
were as dry as a bone, and there would
be no danger of slipping.
	He would try it to-night. If he got
to the top, he would riced twine for haul-
ing up rope,  the Mattingleys should
provide that in good time. He would
also need stone and flint, a knife, a
hammer, and a quilt, all to be hauled up
after he reached the top. For food he
would take what was left of to-days ra-
tions, of which he had eaten very little.
About a half pound of biscuit, near half
a pint of peas, a half pint of oatmeal,
and two ounces of cheese were left. He
could live on that for at least three days.
He also had a horn of good arrack.
When that was gone  well, he was
taking chances; if he died of thirst, it
was no worse than the yard-arm. The
most important thing was a few hundred
feet of strong twine. Of that there was
plenty in the storeroom, amongst the
cordage, and he would get as much as
he needed at once.
	But if he got up, how would the Mat-
tingleys know who it was perched there
on Perc6 Rock? He knew of no signal
which they would understand. Well, if
he got away safely from the Victoire,
he would visit the Mattingleys first,
and then go straight on to Perc6 Rock.
Though it would be moonlight, his steep
way of ascent was on the south side, out
of view of the fleet.
	The rest of the day he did his duty as
faithfully as though he were to be at his
post the next morning. He gave the
usual instructions to the gunsmith and
armorer; he inspected the small arms;
he chose a man, as was the custom, for
gun-room watch; and he ate his supper
phlegmatically in due course.
	It was the last quarter of the moon,
and the neap tide was running low when
he let himself softly down into the wa-
ter. He had the blanket tied on his
head; the food, stone and flint, and oth-
er things were inside the blanket, and
the twine was in his pocket. He was
not seen, and he dropped away quietly
astern. He got clear of the Victoire
while the moon was partially obscured.
Another ship lay in his path, and he
must be careful in passing her. He was
so near her that he could see the watch,
could smell the hot tar and pitch from
the lately caulked seams; he could even
hear the laughter of the young foremast-
men as they turned in.
	At last he was clear of the fleet. Now
it was a question when his desertion
would be discovered. All he asked was
two hours. By that time the deed
would be done, if he could climb Perc6
Rock at all.
	He touched bottom. He was on Perc6
sands. The blanket on his head was
scarcely wetted. He wrung the water
out of his clothes, and ran softly up
the shore. Suddenly he was met by a
cry of Qui va lh? and he stopped
short at the point of Elie Mattingleys
bayonet.
	Hush! was Ranulphs reply, and
he gave his name. Mattingley nearly
dropped his musket in surprise. He
soon knew the tale of Ranulphs mis-
fortunes, but he had not yet been told
of his present plans when there came a
quick footstep on the sands, and Carte-
rette was at her fathers side. Unlike
Mattingley, she did drop her musket at
sight of Ranulph, and impulsively throw-
ing her arms round his neck, she kissed
him on the cheek,  so had this meet-
ing in a new land disarmed her old
timidity.
	she exclaimed, that s for
the Jersey sailor who s come in here
through a fleet of Frenchmen!
	She thought he had stolen into the
harbor under the very nose of Richam-
beau and his squadron. But presently
she was trembling with excitement at the</PB>

story of how ~Ranulph had been pressed
at St. Malo, and all that came after un-
til this very day when he had dismount-
ed the gun not ten feet from where she
stood.
	Go along with Carterette, said Mat-
tingley. Alixandre is at the house;
he 11 help you away into the woods.
	That was not Ranulphs plan, but he
did not mean it for Mattingleys ears;
so he hurried away with Carterette, tell-
ing her his design as they went.
	Ranulph Delagarde, she said vehe-
mently, you cant climb Perc~ Rock.
No one has ever done it, and you must
not try. Oh, I know you are a great
man, but you must not try this. You
will be safe where we shall hide you.
You shall not climb the rock,  ah no,
bhsfli
	He pointed toward the post. They
would nt leave a stick standing there, if
you hid me. No, I m going to the top
of Perc6 Rock.
	Mon doux terrible! she cried, in
sheer bewilderment; and then his inten-
tion inspired her with a purpose. At
last her time had come; she felt it.
	Pardingue, she went on, clutching
his arm, if you go to the top of Perc6
Rock, so will I!
	In spite of his anxiety he almost
laughed.
	But see,  but see, he said, and
his voice dropped; you could nt stay
up there with me all alone, gar~on Car-
terette; and besides, Richambeau would
be firing on you too!
	She was very angry now, but she made
no reply, and he continued quickly:
I 11 go straight to the rock. When
they miss me there 11 be a pot boiling,
you may believe, gar~on Carterette. If
I get up, he added, I 11 let a string
down for a rope you must get for me.
Once on top they cant hurt me. Eh
ben, h bit6t, gar~on Carterette!
	Oh my good! Oh my good! said
the girl, with a quick change of mood.
To think you have come like this, and
perhaps  But she dashed the tears
from her eyes, and bade him go on.

	The tide was well out, the moon shin-
ing brightly. Ranulph reached the point
where, if the rock was to be scaled at
all, the ascent must be made. For a
distance there was shelving where foot-
hold might be had by a fearless man
with a steady head and sure balance.
After that came about a hundred feet
where he would have to draw himself
up by juttings and crevices hand over
hand, where was no natural pathway.
Woe be to him if head grew dizzy, foot
slipped, or strength gave out; his body
would be broken to pieces on the hard
sand below. That second stage once
passed, the ascent thence to the top
would be easier; for though nearly as
steep, it had more ledges, and offered
fair vantage to a man with a foot like a
mountain goat. Ranulph had been aloft
all weathers in his time, and his toes
were as strong as another mans foot,
and surer.
	He started. These toes of his caught
in crevices, held on to ledges, glued
themselves on to smooth surfaces; the
knees clung like a rough-riders to a
saddle; the big bands, when once they
got a purchase, fastened like air-cups.
	Slowly, slowly up, foot by foot, yard
by yard, until one third of the distance
was climbed.
	The suspense and strain were immea-
surable. To Ranulph it was like bring-
ing a brig alone through a gale with a
windward tide, while she yaws and qui-
vers over twice the length of her bilge;
like watching a lower-deck gun strain-
ing under a heavy sea, with the lanyards
and port tackle flying, and no knowing
when the great machine would fly from
her carriage and make fearful havoc.
But he struggled on and on, and at last
reached a sort of flying pinnacle of rock,
like a hook for the shields of the gods.
	Here he ventured to look below, ex-
pecting to see Carterette; but there was</PB>

only the white sand, and no sound save
the long wash of the gulf. He drew the
horn of arrack from his pockei and
drank. He had two hundred feet more
to climb; and the next hundred,  that
would test him, that would be the or-
deal.
	There was no time to lose. While he
hung here a musket-shot could pick him
off from below, and there was no telling
how soon his desertion might be discov-
ered, though he hoped it would not be
till morning. He started again. This
was travail indeed. His rough fingers,
his toes, hard as horn almost, began to
bleed. Once or twice he swung quite
clear of the wall, hanging by his fingers
to catch a surer foothold to right or left,
and just getting it sometimes by an inch
or less. The strain and tension were
terrible. His head appeared to swell
and fill with blood: on the top it hurt
him so that it seemed ready to burst.
His neck was aching horribly with con-
stant looking up; the skin of his knees
was gone; his ankles were bruised. But
he must keep on till he got to the top,
or until he fell.
	He was fighting on now in a kind of
dream, quite apart from all usual feel-
ings of this world. The earth itself
appeared far away, and he was toiling
among vastnesses, himself a giant with
colossal frame and huge sprawling limbs.
It was like the gruesome visions of the
night, when the body is an elusive, stu-
pendous mass that falls into space after
a confused struggle with immensities.
It was all mechanical, vague, almost
numb, this effort to overcome a moun-
tain. Yet it was precise and hugely ex-
pert, too; for though there was a strange
mist on the brain, the body felt its way
with a singular certainty, as might some
molluscan dweller of the sea, sensitive
like a plant, with intuition like an ani-
mal. Yet at times it seemed that this
vast body overcoming the mountain must
let go its hold and slide away into the
darkness of the depths.
	Now there was a strange convulsive
shiver in every nerve  God have mercy,
the time was come! . . . No, not yet.
At the very instant when it seemed the
panting flesh and blood would be shaken
off by the granite force repelling it, the
fingers, like long antennie, touched horns
of rock jutting out from ledges on the
third escarpment of the wall. Here was
the last point of the worst stage of the
journey. Slowly, heavily, the body drew
up to the shelf of limestone and crouched
in an inert bundle. There it lay for a
time.
	While the long minutes went by a
voice kept calling up from below,  call-
ing, calling, at first eagerly, then anx-
lously, then with terror. By and by
the bundle of life stirred, took shape,
raised itself, and was changed into a
man again, a thinking, conscious being,
who now understood the meaning of this
sound coming up from the earth below,
 or was it the sea? A human voice
had at last pierced the awful exhaustion
of the deadly labor, the peril and strife,
which had numbed the brain, while the
body, in its instinct for existence, still
clung to the rocky ledges. It had called
the man back to earth: he was no
longer a great animal, and the rock a
monster with skin and scales of stone.
	Ranulph! Maitre Ranulph! Ah,
Ranulph!
	Now he knew, and he answered down,
All right! All right, gar~on Carte-
rette!
	Are you at the top ?
	No, but the rest is easy.
	Hurry, hurry, Ranulph! If they
should come before you reach the top!
	I 11 soon be there.
	Are you hurt, Ranulph?
	No, but my fingers are in rags. I
am going now,  ~ bitOt, gar~on Car-
terette !
	Ranulph!
	Sh, sh! do not speak. I am start-
ing.
	There was silence for what seemed</PB>

hours to the girl below. Foot by foot
the man climbed on, no less cautious be-
cause the ascent was easier, for he was
weaker. But he was on the monsters
neck now, and soon he should set his
heel on it; he was not to be shaken off.
	At last the victorious moment came.
Over a jutting ledge he drew himself
up by sheer strength and the rubber-like
grip of his lacerated fingers, body, legs,
knees, and now he lay fiat and breathless
upon the ground.
	How soft and cool it was! rhis was
long sweet grass touching his face, mak-
ing a couch like down for the battered,
wearied body. Surely this travail had
been more than mortal. And what was
this vast fluttering over his head, this
million-voiced discord round him, like
the buffetings and cries of spirits who
welcome another to their torment? He
raised his head and laughed in triumph.
These were the cormorants, gulls, and
gannets on the Perc6 Rock.

	Ranulph Delagarde had done what
man had never done before him: he had
done it in the night, with only the moon
to lighten the monstrous labor of his in-
credible adventure; he had accomplished
it without help of any mortal sort.
	Legions of birds circled over him with
wild cries, so shrill and scolding that at
first he did not hear Carterettes voice
calling up to him. At last, however, re-
membering, he leaned over the cliff and
saw her standing in the moonlight far
below.
	Her voice came up to him indistinct-
ly because of the clatter of the birds, 
Maitre iRanulph! Ranulph! She
could not see him, for this part of the
rock was in shadow.
	Ah bah, all right! he said, and
taking hold of one end of the twine he
had brought, he let the roll fall. It
dropped almost at Carterettes feet. She
tied to the end of it the rope she had
brought from the post. He drew it up
quickly. She had found no rope long
enough, so she had tied three together;
Ranuiph must splice them perfectly.
Once more he let down the twine, and
she fastened it to his blanket. It was a
heavy strain on the twine, but the blan-
ket and the food inclosed were got up
safely. He lowered again, and this time
he hauled up tobacco, tea, matches, nee-
dles, cotton, a knife, and a horn of rum.
Now she called for him to splice the
ropes. There was no time to do that,
but he tied them firmly together, and let
the great coil down. This time he drew
up a musket and some ammunition and
another blanket. Again it was let down,
and there were drawn up a crowbar, a
handspike, and some tin dishes, which
rattled derisively against the side of the
great rock. Again the rope went down,
and two bundles of sticks and fagots
were attached, also a small roll of coarse
cotton and a bearskin.
	Ranulph! Ranuiph! came Car-
terettes clear voice again from far be-
low.
	Gar~on Carterette, he replied.
	You must help Sebastian Alixandre
up, she said.
	Sebastian Alixandre! Ranulph re-
plied, dumfounded. Is he there? Why
does he want to come?
	That is no matter, she said. He
is coming. He has the rope round his
waist. Pull away!
	It was better, Ranulph thought to
himself, that he should be on Perc6 Rock
alone, but the terrible strain had bewil-
dered him, and he could make no pro-
test now.
	Dont start yet! he called down.
I 11 pull when all s ready!
	He fell back from the edge to a place
in the grass where, tying the rope round
his body, he could seat himself and brace
his feet against a ledge of rock. Then
he pulled on the rope  and it was round
Carterettes waist!
	Carterette had told her falsehood with-
out shame, for she was of those to whom
the end is more than the means. She</PB>

began climbing, and Ranuiph pulled
steadily. Twice he felt the rope sud-
denly jerk when she lost her footing, but
it came in evenly still, and he used a
nose of rock as a sort of winch. He
knew when the climber was more than
one third of the way up by the greater
weight upon the rope, by the more fre-
quent slippings. Yet this was no such
monstrous struggle as had been Ranulphs
climbing; this was the scaling of a con-
quered wall by the following of the vic-
torious.
	The climber was nearly two thirds of
the way up when a cannon-shot boomed
out over the water, frightening again the
vast covey of birds, which shrieked and
honked till the air was a maelstrom of
cries. Then came another cannon-shot.
	Ranulphs desertion was discovered.
	Upon the other side of the rock boats
were putting out toward the shore.
Ranulph knew each movement as well
as if he were watching them. The fight
was begun between a single Jersey ship-
wright and a fleet of French warships.
	His strength, however, could not last
much longer. Every muscle of his body
had been strained and tortured, and
even this easier task tried him beyond
endurance. His legs stiffened against
the ledge of rock, the tension on his
arms made them numb; he wondered
how near Alixandre was to the top. Sud-
denly there was a pause, then a heavy
jerk. Love of God! the rope was shoot-
ing through his fingers, his legs were
giving way! He gathered himself to-
gether, and then, with teeth, hands, and
body rigid with enormous effort, he
pulled and pulled. Now he could not
see. A mist swam before his eyes.
Everything grew black, but he pulled on
and on.
	He never knew just when the climber
reached the top. But when the mist
cleared away from his eyes Carterette
was bending over him, putting rum to
his lips, as he sat where he had stiffened
with his last great effort.
	Carterette! Gar~on Carterette ! he
murmured, amazed. And then, as the
truth burst upon him, he shook his head
in a troubled sort of way.
	What a cat I was! said Carterette.
What a wild-cat I was to make you
haul me up! It was bad for me with
the rope round me; it must have been
awful for you, my poor ~smanus, my
poor scarecrow Ranulph.
	Scarecrow indeed he looked. His
clothes were nearly gone, his hair was
tossed and matted, his eyes were blood-
shot, his big hands were like pieces of
raw meat, his feet were covered with
blood.
	My poor scarecrow! she repeated,
and she tenderly wiped the blood from
his face where his hands had touched it.
Now bugle-calls and cries of command
came up to them, and in the first light
of morning they could see French offi-
cers and sailors, Mattingley, Alixandre,
and others hurrying to and fro.
	When day came clear and bright, it
was known that Carterette as well as
Ranuiph had vanished. Mattingley
shook his head stoically, but Richam-
beau on the Victoire was as keen to hunt
down one Jersey Englishman as he had
ever been to attack an English fleet, 
more so, perhaps.
	Meanwhile the birds kept up a wild
turmoil and shrieking. Never before
had any one heard them so clamorous.
More than once Mattingley had looked
at Perc6 Rock curiously; but whenever
the thought of it as a refuge came to
him, he put it away. No, it was impos-
sible.
	Yet what was that? Mattingleys
heart thumped under his coat. There
were two persons on the lofty island
wall,  a man and a woman. He caught
the arm of a French officer near him.
Look, look! he exclaimed.
	The officer raised his glass. It s
the gunner! he cried, and handed the
glass to the old man.
	It s Carterette! said Mattingley</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00677" SEQ="0677" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="671">	The Battle of the Strong.	671

in a hoarse voice. But it s not possi-
ble,  its not possible, he added help-
lessly. Nobody was ever there. My
God, look at it,  look at it!
	It was a picture indeed. A man and
a woman were outlined against the clear
air, putting up a tent as calmly as though
on a lawn, thousands of birds wheeling
over their heads, with querulous cries.
	A few moments later Elie Mattingley
was being rowed swiftly to the Victoire,
where Richambeau himself was swear-
ing viciously as he looked through his
telescope. He also had recognized the
gunner.
	He was prepared to wipe out the fish-
ing-post if Mattingley did not produce
Ranulph. Well, here was Ranulph duly
produced, and insultingly setting up a
tent on this sheer rock, with some snip-
pet of the devil, said Richambeau, and
defying a whole French fleet. He would
set his gunners to work. If he only had
as good a marksman as Ranulph himself,
the deserter should drop at the first
shot,  Death and the devil take his
impudent face!
	He was just about to give the order
when Mattingley was brought to him.
The old mans story amazed him beyond
measure.
	It is no man, then! said Richam-
beau, when Mattingley had done. He
must be a damned fly to do it! And
the girl,  sacr~ moi! he drew her up
after him. I 11 have him down out of
that, though, or throw up my flag, he
added, and turning fiercely gave his or-
ders.
	For hours the French ships bombard-
ed the lonely rock from the north. The
white tent was carried away, but the
cannon-balls flew over or merely bat-
tered the solid rock, the shells were
thrown beyond, and no harm was done.
But now and again the figure of Ra-
nulph appeared, and a half dozen times
be took aim with his musket at the
French soldiers on the shore. Twice his
shots took effect: one man was wounded,
and one killed. Then whole companies
of marines returned a musketry fire at
him, to no purpose. At his ease he hid
himself in the long grass at the edge
of the cliff, and picked off two more
men.
	Here was a ridiculous thing: one man
and a slip of a girl fighting and defying
a whole squadron. The smoke of battle
covered miles of the great gulf. Even
the sea birds shrieked in ridicule.
	This went on for three days at inter-
vals. With a fine chagrin, Richambeau
and his fleet saw a bright camp-firelight-
ed on the rock, and knew that Ranuiph
and the girl were cooking their meals in
peace. A flagstaff, too, was set up, and
a red cloth waved defiantly in the breeze.
At last, Richambeau, who had watched
the whole business from the deck of the
Victoire, burst out laughing at the ab-
surd humor of the situation, and sent
for Elie Mattingley.
	I ye had enough, said he. How
long can he last up there?
	He 11 have birds eggs in plenty,
and there s wild berries too, besides
ground rats and all of them. And if
I know my girl, there s rations gone
aloft, replied Mattingley, with a grim
smile. Chest tr~s ship - shap? up
there !
	Come, I ye had enough, said Hi-
chambeau, and he gave orders to stop
firing.
	When the roar of cannon had ceased
he said to Mattingley again, There
never was a wilder jest, and I 11 not
spoil the joke. He has us on his toast-
ing-fork. I shall give him the honor of a
flag of truce, and he must come down.
His lower lip shook with laughter.
	And so it was that a French fleet sent
a flag of truce to the foot of Perc6
Rock, and a French officer, calling up,
gave the word of honor of his captain
that Ranuiph should suffer nothing at
the hands of a court-martial, and that
he should be treated as a prisoner of
war.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00678" SEQ="0678" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="672">	672	The Battle of the Strona.
	As a prisoner of war! thought Ra-
nuiph. Then he was to be treated like
an English belligerent, and not like a
French deserter. He accepted Richam-
beaus offer, and, with Carterette, made
ready to descend. It was easier going
down than coming up.
	There was no court-martial. After
Ranulph,at Richambeau s command, had
told the tale of the ascent, the French-
man said, No one but an Englishman
could be fool enough to try such a thing,
and none but a fool could have had the
luck to succeed. You have proved, gun.
ner, that you are no Frenchman.
	Then I am no deserter, monsieur?
asked Ranuiph.
You are a fool, gunner; but even a
fool can get a woman to follow him, and
so this flyaway followed you  arid 
Carterette flew at Richambeau as
though to scratch his eyes out, but Ra-
nulph held her back.
	And you are condemned, gunner,
continued Richambeau dryly, to marry
the said maid before sundown, or be
carried out to sea a prisoiier of war.
	So saying, he laughed and bade them
begone to the wedding.

	Rr~nulph left Richambeaus ship be.
wildered and perturbed. For hours he
paced the shore, and at last his thoughts
began to clear. The new life he had
led during the last few months had
brought many revelations. He had come
to realize that there are several kinds of
happiness, but that all may be divided
into two classes, the happiness of doing
good to ourselves, and that of doing
good to others. It all opened out clear-
ly to him, as he thought of Carterette
in the light of Richambeans coarse jest.
	For years he had known in a sort of
way that Carterette preferred him to
any other man. He knew now that she
had remained single because of him.
For him her impatience had been pa-
tience; her fiery heart had spilt itself
in tenderness for his misfortunes. She
who had lightly tossed lovers aside, her
coquetry appeased, had to himself shown
sincerity without coquetry, loyalty with-
out selfishness. He knew well that she
had been his champion in dark days;
that he had received far more from her
than he had ever given, even of friend-
ship. In his own absorbing love for
Guida Landresse, during long years, he
had been unconsciously blind to a devo-
tion which had lived on without hope,
without repining, with untiring cheerful-
ness.
	In those three days spent on the top
of the Perc6 Rock how blithe gar~on
Carterette had been! Danger had
seemed nothing to her. She had the
temper of a man in her real enjoyment
of the desperate chances of life. He
had never seen her so buoyant; her an-
imal spirits had never leaped so high.
And yet withal, despite the boldness
which had sent her to the top of Perc6
Rock with him, there had been in all
her demeanor a modesty at once frank
and free from self-consciousness. She
could think for herself, she was sure of
herself, and she would go to the ends of
the earth for him. Surely he had not
earned such friendship, such affection.
	He recalled how, the night before, as
they sat by their little camp-fire, perched
there between heaven and earth, the
fleet beneath on one hand and the fish-
ing-post on the other, the tall masts flick-
ering in the moonlight, the flagstaff lift-
ed above the fort like a white finger, 
he recalled how, after a long silence, she
had risen to her feet, had come over and
touched him on the shoulder, and look-
ing down at him had said, I feel as if
I was beginning my life all over again;
dont yon, Maitre Ranulph?
	Her black eyes had been fixed on his,
and the fire in them was as bright and
full of health and truth as the fire at his
feet. He had answered her, I think
I feel that, too, gar~on Carterette.
	Then she replied, It is nt hard to
forget here,  not so very hard, is it?</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00679" SEQ="0679" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="673">	Unpublished Letters of Carl yle.	673

	She did not mean Guida, nor what he
had felt for Guida, but rather the mis-
ery of the past. He had nodded his
head in reply, but had not spoken; and
she, with a quick A bit6t, had taken
her blanket and gone to that part of
Perc6 Rock which was set apart for her
own. Then he had sat by the fire think-
ing through the long hours of the night;
and by the time the sun rose and the
sailors were stirring in the sloops below
he realized that a new life had been
born in him. That day Richambeau
had sent his flag of truce, and the end of
their stay on Perc6 Rock had come.
	Now he would marry Carterette.
Yet he was not disloyal, even in mem-
ory. What had belonged to Guida be-
longed to her forever,  belonged to
a past life with which henceforth he
should have naught to do. What had
sprung up in his heart for Carterette be-
longed to this new life. It had the dig-
nity of affection, and it had the power
of unselfishness. In this new land
there was work to do,  what might he
not accomplish here? He realized that
within one life a man may still live sev-
eral lives, each after its kind, and yet
not be dishonest or disloyal. A fate
stronger than himself had brought him
here, and here he would stay with fate.
It had brought him to Carterette, and
who could tell what good and content-
ment might not yet come to him, and
how much to her!

	That evening he went to Carterette
and asked her to be his wife. She
turned pale, and, looking up into his
eyes with a kind of fear, she said bro-
kenly, It s not because you feel you
must? It s not because you know I
love you, Ranulph, is it? It is not for
that alone?
	It is because I want you, gar~on
Carterette, he answered tenderly, 
because life will be nothing without
you.~~
	I am so happy, par mad6,  I am so
happy! she said, and she hid her face
on his breast.

XXIII. TO MRS. HAHEING, AT THE GILL, FROM
HER MOTHER.

ScOTsBRIG, Monday [184018b1].
	Mv DEAR JENNY,  I have been long-
ing for you to come here for a long time.
I want to send two hams on to London.
Could you get a box which would hold
the shirts and both could be sent at the
same time. If you have not sent them
any, bring them over as soon as you
can, and come soon. At any rate bring
the winter things that Jean sent. We
are all in our frail way of health. Give
my kindest love to young and old.
Ever your old mother,

	Much as Carlyle had been thinking
about Cromwell, another book was to
come first,  a book for which his very
trip to Cromwells country was fruitful
in suggestion. At St. Ives he bad seen
not only Cromwells farm, but also St.
Ives poorhouse with its inhabitants, 
in the sun, to be sure, but neither
spinsters nor knitters, nor workers after
any fashion, for the simple reason that
they had no work to do. The Chartist
riots of 1842 remained in Carlyles mind
with this symbolic picture, and by Octo-
ber of the same year he was deeply pon-
dering the condition of the English
nation all sitting enchanted, the poor
enchanted so that they cannot work, the
rich enchanted so that they cannot en-
joy. Over against this contemporary
view Carlyle set the life of the monks
of Bury St. Edmunds, as told by their
chronicler, Jocelyn de Brakelonde; and
the result was Past and Present, writ-
ten, apparently with less struggle than
any of the authors other books, in the
first seven weeks of 1843. Although Car-
lyle went too far in this work,  as in-
deed he so seldom failed to do,  Past
and Present proved the germ of more
than one sadly needed reform; and the
splendid, sonorous passage beginning,
All true work is sacred, will remain,
one must believe, an inalienable posses-
sion of English literature and English
morals.
	Publication followed in April, and
soon afterward Carlyle wrote in his
Journal: That book always stood be-
tween me and Cromwell, and now that
has fledged itself and flown off. Face
to face with Oliver again, Carlyle went
ln the summer of 1843 to see famous
battlefields of the civil war. He so
planned his itinerary as to reach Dunbar
on the 3d of September,  the day of
the fight there, the day of Worcester
fight, and the day of Cromwells death.
	This professional journey was pre-
ceded by a peaceful month at Scotsbrig,
and followed by a visit to Erskine which
fixes the date of the next letter.

	Yesterday by appointment, the good
Thomas Erskine took me up at Kirk-
caldy, carried me off hither on the top
of the coach, bag and baggage. The
day was damp and dim, not exactly wet,
yet in danger of becoming very. There
had been rain in the night time (Sab-
bath night or early on Monday morn-
ing) but there fell no more. This day
again is oppressively hot, dry yet with-
out sun or wind  a baddish day for
a stook. But they prophesy fair wea-
ther now  which I shall be glad of,
and the whole country will be glad,
for all is white here, in sheaves and
stooks, and little got into ricks. We
got here abont 5 in the evening, a great</PB>

party of people in the house (a big
Lairds house with fiankeys &#38; c., &#38; c.). I
was heartily tired before I got to bed.
I do not think I shall be rightly at rest
till I get on ship board, then I will lie
down and let all men have a care of
stirring me,  they had better let the
sleeping dog lie! The Dundee steam-
ers are allowed to be the best on these
waters, large swift ships and very few
passengers in them at present. I spoke
for my place yesterday and am to have
the best. The kind people here will re-
lieve me down (it is four miles off) and
then about 4 oclock in the afternoon 
I shall  light a pipe in peace and think
of you all, speaking not a word. I ex-
pect to sleep well there too, and then on
Friday, perhaps about 3 oclock, I may
be at London Bridge and home by the
most convenient conveyance to Chelsea
for dinner. This, if all go well, this
ends for the present my pilgrirnings up
and down the world.
	Dear Mother, I wish I had gone di-
rect home when I left you, for it is not
pleasant somehow to be still in Scotland
and fay from you. I speak not the
thoughts I send towards you, for speech
will not express them. If I arrive home
on Friday you may perhaps find a news-
paper at Ecclefechan on Sabbath morn-
ing, Monday much likelier. God bless
you all.
tising on her accursed piano - forte.
There had then to be another upheaval:
down went a partition in one room, up
went a new chimney in another; and
still another library, farther from the
piano, was thus contrived. Finally, the
young lady, charmed by a seductive
letter from Carlyle, agreed never to
play until two in the afternoon. The
dinner hour was changed to the middle
of the day, because Carlyle thought it
would be better for his (ligestion.
	Although these changes, which in Mrs.
Carlyles account seem planet-shaking,
were in the interest of Cromwell, Crom-
well re~~ained persistently unwritable.
On the 4th of December the historian
wrote to Sterling: Confound it! I
have lost four years of good labour in
the business; and still the more I expend
on it, it is like throwing good labor after
bad. Two days later he put a better
face on it to his mother.
xxv.	cARLYLE TO HIS MOTHER, ScOTsBRIG.

CHELSEA, Monday, 6th Dec. 1843.
	M~ DEAR MoTHER,We have a
letter from Jean this week, who reports
a visit to you and gives us a description
of what you were about. We were very
glad to look in upon you in that way.
Jean describes you as very well when
they came, but since then (though she
tells us of your prohibition to mention it
T. CARLYLE. at all) there has been some ill turn of
health which we long greatly to hear of
the removal of! I study, dear Mother,
not to afflict myself with useless anxie-
ties, but on the whole it is much better
that one knows exactly how matters do
stand, the very fact, no better and no
worse than it is. To-day there was a
little iNote from James Aitken apprising
us that the Books are come, that Jenny
is with him. He has evidently heard
nothing farther from Scotsbrig, so we
will hope things may have got into their
usual course again there. But Jamie or
somebody may write us a scrap of intel-
ligence, surely?
	Carlyle returned from his travels
very bilious, so his wife wrote to Mrs.
Aitken in October, 1843, and contin-
ues very bilious up to this hour. He
could not refuse a certain admiration
at the state of the house, which had
been painted and papered in his absence.
Mrs. Carlyle, with her own hands, had
put down carpets, newly covered chairs
and sofas, and arranged a library ac-
cor(iing to his (expressed) mind. His
satisfaction lasted only three days, for
on the morning of the fourth day the
young lady next door took a fit of prac</PB>

	This is said to be a very unhealthy
season here; for the past two months
about two hundred more deaths in the
week have occurred than is usual at this
season, but J rather conjecture it is the
result of the long continued hardship
the Poor have been suffering, which
now, after wearing out the constitution
by hunger and distress of mind, begins
to tell more visibly Our weather is
very mild, soft without any great quan-
tity of rain and not at all disagreeable.
Janes cold is gone again and we are in
our common way. My Book goes on
badly, yet I do think it goes on, in fact
it must go: Bore away at it with con-
tinuous boring day and night and it will
be obliged to go! I study however not
to split my gall with it, but to
hasten slowly as the old iRomans
said. When writing will not brother
with me at all, I fling it entirely by and
go and walk many a mile in the coun-
try. I have big thick shoes, my jacket
is waterproof against slight rain, I take
a stick in my hand and walk with long
strides. The farther ill walk, the abler
I grow; in fact I am rather in better
health, I think, than usual, if all things
are considered. Jack and I had a long
walk after Tailors for some three hours
in the moonlight streets last night. To-
day it is damp, but I am for a sally
again. Alas, it is but a very poor morn~
ing task I have done, but we cannot help
it.	Adieu, dear good Mother, for our
sakes take care of yourself. My love
to all.
Yours affections

	Carlyle never liked any portrait of him-
self. The one mentioned in the follow-
ing letter had made him look like a
flayed horses head.

XXVI.	cARLYLE TO HIS MOTHER, scOTSBRIG.

CHELSEA, 10th March, 1844.
	MY DEAR MOTHER,  It is a shame
for me if I do not write a bit of a letter
to you. There is nothing else I can do
for you at present. I will scribble you
a few words of news on this paper, let
other employments fare as they can for
the present.
	I sent your good little note to the
Doctor. Jamies letter for Alick came
duly to hand and was duly forwarded; I
also wrote a letter to Alick myself. Poor
fell2w, I suppose he has had a very sol-
itary, meditative winter of it over in
America, and has no doubt had a great
many reflections in his head, looking back
and looking forward, with perhaps sad-
ness enough, but it will do him good, I
really believe. Perhaps this winter, seem-
ingly one of the idlest he has had, may
turn out to be one of the most profitably
occupied. My own hope and persuasion
is that he will now do well, that he is prob-
ably about to begin a new course of ac-
tivity on better terms than before, better
terms both inward and outward, and that
in fine, poor fellow, he may begin to see
the fruit of his labor round him and go
on with much more peace and prosperity
than heretofore. . . . I also like the
tone of his letters, which is much quieter
than it used to be. He does not know,
I suppose, in what direction he is to go
when April arrives. I urged, as Jamie
did, that a healthy quality of situation
should outweigh all other considerations
whatever, that for the rest all places
seemed to me much alike; if the land
were cheap, it would be unfavourably
situated &#38; c. I also hinted my notion
that a small piece of good handy soil
might be preferable to a large lot of un-
towardly, outlying ground. We can only
hope and pray he may be guided well.
We cannot assist him with any real
guidance. Difficulties beset a man every-
where under this sun. There if he have
patience, insight. energy and justness of
mind he will daily conquer farther,
not otherwise, either in America or here.
But, as I said, I have never lost hope
with Alick, and I have now better hope
than ever. We will commit him to the</PB>

all-wise Governor with many a prayer
from the bottom of all our hearts that it
may be well with him. To hear and
know that he does see good under the
sun, fighting his way like a true man in
that new country!  what a comfort to
you and to every one of us. My dear
Mother, I know your heart is many a
time sad about Alick. He is far away
and there are others of us gone still
farther, beyond the shores of this earth,
whither our poor thoughts vainly strive
to follow them,  our hearts love fol-
lowing them still:  but we know this
one thing, that God is there also, in
America, in the dark Grave itself and
the unseen Eternity  even He is there
too, and will not He do all things well?
We have no other Anchor of the soul in
any of the tempests, great or little, of
this world. By this let us hold fast and
piously hope in all scenes and seasons
whatsoever. Amen.
	You bid me call on Patience in
this Book of mine. Dear Mother, it is
the best and only good advice that can
be given. I do endeavour to call on
patience and sometimes she comes, and
if I keep my shoulder stiffly at the wheel
withal, we shall certainly get under way
by and bye. The thing goes indeed, or
now promises to go, a little better with
me. I stand to it as I can. But it
will be a terribly difficult job and take
a long time, I think. However, that
it is a useful one, worthy to be done by
me I am resolved, and so I will do it
if permitted  the return and earthy
reward of it may be either great or
small, or even nothing and abuse into
the bargain, just as it likes. Thank
Heaven I can do either or any way as
to that, for this time, and indeed, often
when I look at it, the prizes people get
in this world and the kind of people that
get them seem but a ridiculous business.
If there Were not something more seri-
ous behind all that, I think it would
hardly be worth while to live in such a
place as this world at all. In short I
hold on the best I can  and my good
Mothers picture looking down on me
here, seems to bid me call on Pa-
tience and persevere like a man.
	Jane has not been very well in these
cold stormy weeks, but I think is now
getting better again. It is the spring
weather, which this year has been the
real winter; all manner of people are
unwell here at present. You in the
North have it still worse, far worse than
we. Many a time have I asked myself
what is becoming of my good old Mo-
ther in these wild blasts. Surely you
keep good fires at Scotsbrio? Surely
you wear the new Hawick sloughs? Jane
finds hers very warm and nice; but the
thing you might improve greatly and
never do is your diet. I think you
should live chiefly on fowl. A hen is
always fair food, divide her into four
pieces  she makes you an excellent
dinner of soup and meat for four days.
This you know very well for others, but
never learn it for yourself. I am very
serious. You should actually set about
this reform. Do now  you will find
it more important on your health than
any medicine or other appliance you can
think of. Jenny, I suppose, is still at
the Gill. When you feel tired of soli-
tude again she will come back to you.
The bairns as they grow will be quieter
and give less trouble. Poor Jenny, no
doubt of it, she has many cares of her
own: we should all be gentle with her,
pity her and help her what we can.
	But now I suppose you are very im-
patient to know what is in that paste
board roll tied with string. Open the
string with your scissors and you will
see  one of the ugliest pictures ever
drawn of man. A certain person here
has been publishing some book called
Spirit of the Age, pretending to give
people account of all the remarkable
men of the age; he has put me into it 
better luck to him. He wrote several
months ago requesting that I should
furnish him with some life of myself </PB>

forsooth! This I altogether begged leave
respectfully to decline, but he got hold
of a picture that a certain painter has
of me, and of this he has made an en-
graving,  like me in nothing, or in very
little, I should flatter myself. Let Isa-
bella roll the paper of it the contrary
way and then it will lie flat, if indeed
the post office bags do not squeeze it all
to pieces, which I think is fully as like-
ly and will be no great matter. I sent
it to you as to the one that had a right
to it. Much good may it do you!
	Jamie said he would write. Let him
do so  or else you yourself ought to
write, or both will be best. Jack and
I were at Dinner together among a set
of notables the night before last, came
home together smoking two cigars, all
right. Adieu, dear Mother, my big
sheet is done. My regards to Isabella,
to Jamie and them all. My blessings
with you, dear Mother.
Yours affect.
T.	CARLYLE.


	In 1844 there was no Scotland for
Carlyle, but early in September he went
to Mr. and Lady Harriet Baring at the
Grange. The Baring friendship had
begun to rise into his life.  not yet in
the form of a cloud.
	All the rest of the year Carlyle stayed
closely at home, working on Cromwell,
and seeing fewer people than usual.
The following quaint fragment belongs
to this period, from which Froude has
preserved none of Carlyles letters or
journal record.

Exvii. CARLYLE TO MRS. MANNING.

CHELSEA, 16th Dec. 1844.

	DEAR JENNY,  I dare say you can
knit Wristikins. It has struck me in
these cold days I might as well apply
to you to have a pair. The best pair I
yet have is a very old pair now, which
either you, or I think Jean, knit for me
at Hoddam Hill when you were little
bairns many years ago. They have beau-
tiful stripes of red yet, as fresh as ever.
In fact I sometimes wear them in pre-
ference to the pair Jane has bought for
me out of the shops here. Being al-
ready provided as you see I will not in
the least hurry you as to the matter 
wait till you have leisure, till you can
get right your colors &#38; c. &#38; c.  only I
will tell you what kind of thing will suit
me and how you can do it when con-
venient. The great defect of all my
present wristikins is that they are too
slight, too thin, and do not fill up the
cuff of the coat, which is rather wide
with me. They should be at least double
the common thickness of those in the
shops. If you had fine, boozy yarn and
took it two ply it will make a pretty ar-
ticle. Then as to color, it should be deep
for our reeky atmosphere here; red
is beautiful, a stripe of good red, and
holds out well, but perhaps the basis had
better be some sort of brown. Please
your own eye. There never was a good
horse had an ill color. As to breadth
I think they should be at least three
inches.

	The horse which Carlyle describes to
his mother as a very darling article
was a new one, called Black Duncan.
	Of Addiscombe Froude writes: The
Barings had a villa at Addiscombe, and
during the London season frequently es-
caped into the Surrey sunshine.~~

xxviii.	CARLYLE TO HIS MOTHER, SCOTSBRIG.

CHELSEA, 12th July, 1845.
	M~ DEAR MOTHER,  My hurry is
indeed great, but it ought to be greater
than it is before I neglect writing you a
little word this week as I did last. I
am whipt about from post to pillar at a
strange rate in these weeks.
	Jacks visit to you was a welcome
piece of news here. The good account
he gave of you was munch wanted. We
are very sorry indeed to hear of poor
Isabella. It seems as if nothing could be
done for her, and her own weakness and</PB>

suffering must be very great. Jamie is
kind and patient, you may assure him
of our sympathies. A sudden turn for
the better may take place, I understand,
as of its own accord all at once. Let
us keep hoping the best.
	The back of this sorrowful Book is
now broken. I think another month of
stiff labour will see it well through.
They are printing away at the second
volume  about half done. I have to
go along amid endless confusions, the
way one has to do in all work whatso-
ever. The Book will, on the whole, be
better than I hoped, and I have had
some honest thoughts in the writing of
it which make me the more careless what
kind of reception the world gives it.
The world had better try to understand
it, I think, and to like it as well as it
can! Here is another leaf of a proof
sheet to be a token to you of our pro-
gress. So soon as ever it is over I am
off for Annandale. The heat has never
been very oppressive to me, never vio-
lent beyond a day or two at a time,
then rain comes and cools it again. I
get considerable benefit of my horse,
which is a very darling article, black,
high, very good natured, very swift 
and takes me out into the green country
for a taste of that almost every day. I
sometimes think of riding it up into
Annandale, but that will be too lengthy
an operation.
	Jane is going to Liverpool to her
Uncles in a fortnight. She will stay
with them a week, then another week
with some country friends in that quar-
ter. I wished her to go to Scotland
and see old friends there at Haddington
and elsewhere, but she is rather reluc-
tant to that. She is not very strong and
has many sorrows of her own, poor little
thing, being very solitary in the world
now. In summer however she is always
better.
	I have heard nothing from Jack of
late days. I suppose him to be still at
Mr. Raines. Perhaps uncertain whither-
ward he will go next. At any rate
country is better than town at present,
 free quarter than board-wages. I ex-
pect he will come back to you again be-
fore the season end.
	We were out at a place called Addis-
combe last week among great people,
very kind to us, but poor Jane could
sleep only about an hour each night 
three hours in all. I stayed but one
night, came home on my black horse
again. Some peace and rest among
green things would be very welcome to
me  and it is coining soon, I hope.
Adieu, dear Mother  my kind love to
you and to all of them. I am in great
haste and can speak but a few words to
mean much by them. My blessings with
you.

	Dr. Carlyles Dante, which he was
very eager upon, was the prose trans-
lation of the Inferno, so well done that
many readers have regretted that the
translator did not proceed.

XXIX.	CARLYLE TO HIS MOTHER, scoTSBEIG.
CHELSEA, 31 Octr, 1845.

	Mv DEAR MOTHER,  You will take
a short word from me rather than none
at all, to tell you that we are all strug-
gling along here without disaster; which
indeed is all that is to be told. I write
also to see if I can induce you to make
use of one of those Letter-covers which
I left, and to send me a small line about
yourself and how you are. Except one
short line from Jamie to the Doctor, I
have heard nothing at all since I left
you.
	There has been no rain, or almost
none whatever since I left Scotsbrig;
so that, I hope, tho your weather can
hardly have been so favourable, Jamie
is now over with his harvest, and fast
getting all secured under thatch-and-
rope. The Potatoe business, as I learn
from the Newspapers, proves very seri-
ous everywhere, in Ireland as much as
anywhere; and over all Europe there is</PB>

a rather deficient crop; besides which,
the present distracted railway specula-
tion and general fever of trade is near-
ly certain to break down soon into deep
confusion, so that one may fear a bad
winter for the poor, a sad thing to look
forward to. They are best off, I think,
who have least to do with that brutal
Chase for money which afflicts me wher-
ever I go in this country. Give me
neither poverty nor riches, feed me with
food convenient for me.
	Our freedom from rain has not hin-
dered the November fogs from coming
in somewhat before their time. The
weather is not wholesome, many people
have got cold in these late days. I ad-
vise you, dear Mother, to put on your
winter clothing and be cautious of going
out except when the sun is shining. In
the morning and evening do not venture
at all. This is the most critical time of
all, I believe, these weeks while the
change to winter is just in progress. Ii
thought myself extremely well here for
a week after my return, and indeed was
so and hope again to be so  much im-
proved by my journey,  but last Sab-
bath, paying no heed to these frost fogs,
I caught a little tickling in my nose
which rapidly grew into a sniftering,
and by the time next day came I had a
regular ugly face-ache and fair founda-
tion for cold in all its forms, which re-
quired to be energetically dealt with
and resisted on the threshold. Next
day, accordingly, I kept the house strict-
ly and appealed to medicine and their
diet, and so on Wednesday morning I
had got the victory again and have been
getting round and growing nearer the
old point ever since  in fact reckon my-
self quite well again, except that I take
a little care of going out at night &#38; c.
Jane has had a little whiff of cold too,
but it is abating again. We are taught
by these visitations to be upon our guard.
The Doctor is quite well, tho I think he
sits too much in the house, being very
eager upon his Dante at present.
	They are not to publish the Cromwell
till the middle of next month 
about a fortnight.

	They are not to publish the Crom-
well till the middle of next month,
wrote Carlyle in the preceding letter.
As a matter of fact the book did not get
out until December.
	Carlyle and his wife did go to the
Barings in the middle of November, and
the date of the following undated f rag-
ment thus swings between the 1st and
the 15th of November. Carlyle says
here that they were invited to the
Grange; Froude, that Mr. Baring and
Lady Harriet were at Bay House, in
Hampshire. Grange is probably a
slip of the pen.

XXX.	(JARLYLE TO HIS MOTHER, SCOT5BHIG.

CHELSEA [1/15 November, 1845].
	It lies perfectly ready, but the
Town is still very empty; besides they
are getting ready a Portrait, the rudi-
ments of which John and I went to see
the other day, but did not very much
like. I fear it will not turn out much of
an ornament to the Book or a true like-
ness of Oliver; but we cannot help that.
Nor does it very much matter.  For
the rest, I am and have been nearly as
idle as possible; merely reading Books,
and doing other small etceteras.
	There is an invitation to go down
to the Grange (where I was the other
year), for Jane and me both, for a few
days (perhaps three); but I think it is
not certain whether we can accept in
such a state of the weather, etc. It will
be within the next ten days if at all.
We are very quiet here at home; hard-
ly anybody yet coming about us: and
indeed in general it is, the fewer the
better, with us.
	I cannot yet learn with the least dis-
tinctness whether John is for Scotsbrig
or not; but I continue to think he will
after all come down and plant himself
there with his Dante for a while. I</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00687" SEQ="0687" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="681">	Unpublished Letters of Carlyle.	681

have fully expressed your wishes to him
in regard to that; and certainly if he
do not come it will not be for want of
wish to be there.
	Jenny, I suppose, is home again: all
is grown quiet in the upstairs rooms!
My dear good Mother, let us not be
sad, let us rather be thankful,  and
still hope in the Bounty which has long
been so benignant to us. I will ]ong re-
member your goodness to me at Scots-
brig on this occasion, and the sadness
that is in it I will take as inevitable, 
every joy has its sorrow here.
	If I think of any Carlisle Tobacco I
will send word about it in good time;
if I send no word, do not in the least
delay about it.

	In February, 1846, a new edition
was needed of the Cromwell. Fresh
letters of Oliver had been sent which
required to be inserted according to
date; a process, Carlyle said, requiring
ones most excellent talent, as of shoe-
cobbling, really that kind of talent car-
ried to a high pitch.
	He had to unhoop his tub, which
already held water, as he sorrowfully
put his case to Mr. Erskine, and insert
new staves.
	Other editors of letters, before and
since, have had such cobbling and coop-
ering to do.

XXXI.	CARLYLE TO MRS. HANNING, DUMFRIES.

CHELSEA, Monday, 29th June, 1846.
	DEAR JENNY,  I heard of your ar-
rival in your new place at Dumfries a
day or two ago, and on Saturday I sent
you a newspaper which I suppose you
will receive this morning. You will
understand it as a hasty token that we
are in our usual way and still mindful
of you, although there has been little
express writing of late.
	No doubt you will feel a little lonely,
unaccustomed, and now and then dispir-
ited and anxious in your new situation.
Yet I do consider it a very fit change
for you to have made, and believe con-
fidently you will find yourself much
more comfortable than you have been
in your old place, if once you are fairly
hefted to the new one. Do not be dis-
couraged, my little Jenny, I know you
will behave always in a douce, prudent,
industrious and wise way, and there is
no fear of you, if so. You will be mis-
tress of your own little heart at any
rate, free to follow your own wisest pur-
poses. I think you will gradually find
work, too, which may be useful to you.
In short this is a fact always, in Max-
well-town and in all towns and situa-
tions,  a person that does act wisely
will find wise and good results following
him in this world and in all worlds;
which really is the comfort of poor
struggling creatures here below. And
I hope you understand firmly always
that you have friends who will never
forsake you, whom all considerations
bind to help you what they can, in the
honest fight you are making. So do
not fear, my poor little sister; be wise
and true and diligent and do the best
you can, and it shall all be well yet, and
better than we hope.
	Getting into a new house, it strikes
me, you must find various things defec-
tive and not yet in order, so you must
take this bit of paper from me which
James Aitken, on Wednesday first, will
change into three sovereigns for you 
and you must lay them out in furnitures
and bits of equipments such as you see
needfullest. I know nobody that could
lay them out better and make more ad-
vantage of them than you will do, only you
want to consider that this is a supernu-
merary thing, a clear gift, and that your
regular income (which John said was
to be enlarged  whatever he may have
settled it) will arrive at the usual time
independently of this. And so, my
blessing with you, dear little Jenny, and
right good days to you in this new dwell-
ing,  right wise days, which are the
only good ones.</PB>

	I have owed Jean a letter this long
time. Tell her a box of supplements to
Cromwell (one for each of you and two
new copies of the whole book  one for
my mother, the other for Jack) will reach
her in a day or two, which she will know
how to dispose of. For the rest, I am
fast getting through my book,  it is
mere tatters of work now,  and ex-
pect to be off northward before long.
Northward we do mean; Jane some-
times talks of being off this week and I
to follow in a week or two. To Sea-
forth, Liverpool, is Janes first place.
I, of course, will soon be across if once
there. Good be with you, dear sister.
	Yours always,	T. C.
	Do you address the next newspaper
to us if this come all right. That will
be a sufficient sign to us.

xxxii.	CARLYLE TO MRS. AITREN, DUMFRIES.

CHELSEA, Saturday, 17th October, 1846.
	DEAR SISTER,  That letter for the
Doctor reached me last night with in-
structions, as you see, to forward it to
you. There is another little one from
poor little Jane, which I like still bet-
ter, but I am ordered to return it to
my mother. Alick is going on very tol-
erably and seems to do as well as one
could expect in his new settlement, 
somewhat bitter of temper yet, but dili-
gent and favoured to see the fruits of
his diligence.
	We are extremely quiet here, not
writing, or expressly meditating to write,
resting in fact, for I find Chelsea great-
ly the quietest place I could meet with.
This long while I read a great many
books of very little value, see almost
nobody except with the eye merely, find
silence better than speech  sleep bet-
ter than waking! My thoughts are
very serious, I will not call them sor-
rowful or miserable; I am getting fairly
old and do not want to be younger  I
know not whether Jeffrey would call
that happy or not.
	Our maid Helen is leaving us, invited
to be some Housekeeper to a brother
she has in Dublin, at present a rich
trader there, all upon float  as I some-
times fear. Jane is busy negotiating
abont a successor, hopes to get a suitable
one from Edinburgh or almost to have
got such. You have not written to me.
Tell Jenny I will send her some word
soon. My kind regards to James. Good
be with you and your house, dear Jean.
Jane is out, and therefore silent.
	Ever yours,	T. C.

	Between 1846 and the spring of 1849
Carlyle had made the acquaintance of
Louis Blanc, John and Jacob Bright, and
Sir Robert Peel.
	On the 30th of June, 1849, Carlyle
started on a journey through Ireland, 
the notes of which were printed after
his death,  and returned on the 7th of
August. He went directly to Scotsbrig,
where, owing to cocks and other blessed
fellow-inhabitants of this planet, he was
a good deal disquieted. In Scotsbrig he
remained, however, till the end of Au-
gust.

XXXIII.	CARLYLE TO MRS. HANNING, DUM-
FRIES.

SCOTSBRIG, 18 August, 1849.

	DEAR SISTER JENNY,  Here is a
Draft for your money, which you will
get by presenting that Paper at the Bank,
when the Martinmas Term comes; I wish
you much health and good industrious
days till the 22nd comes round again;
and have done nothing more gladly, I
may say, in the payment line than write
this little paper for you, ever since the
last was written, I think. It gave me
very great pleasure to see your neat little
Lodging and thrifty, modest, and wise
way of life, when we were in Dumfries
the other day. The reports of all friends
agree in testifying to the same effect.
Continue so, my good little sister, and fear
nothing that can befall. Our outward
fortune, lucky or what is called unlucky,
we cannot command; but we can com</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00689" SEQ="0689" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="683">	Unpublished Letters of Garlyle.	683

inand our own beh~viour under it, and
we do either wisely or else not wisely;
and that, in real truth, makes all the
difference,  and does in reality stamp
us as either lucky or else unlucky.
For there is nobody but he that acts
foolishly and wrong that can, in the
end, be called unlucky; he that acts
wisely and right is, before all mortals, to
be accounted lucky; he and no other
than he. So toil honestly along, my
dear little Jenny, even as heretofore;
and keep up your heart. An elder
brothers duty to you, I trust I may
promise, you shall never stand in want
of while I live in this world.
	Take the next Courier (which Jean
will give you for the purpose) and ad-
dress it in your own hand to me: Care
of John Fergus, M. P. etc., Kirkcaldy,
 or in fact if James Aitken write that,
it will be all the same,  and I shall need
no other sign that you have received this
Note and Inclosure safe. You can tell
James to send only one Courier that
way; but to direct the other to Scots-
brig till further notice.
	Our Mother and I got well home on
Thursday; the thunder - showers hung
and fell heavy on all hands of us; but
we escaped with little damage from
theni,  got no rain at all till we were
on the top of Dodbeck (or rather Dane-
by) Banks; which rain was never vio-
lent upon us, and had as good as ended
altogether by the time we reached the
old Gildha Road. Our Mothers new
bonnet, or any of her clothes, suffered
nothing whatever. There had been
great rains here and all the way; the
fields all running brooks, and the road-
conduits hardly able to contain the loads
they had. It was a good deal clearer
yesterday; yet, in the evening, we had
again a touch of rain, which I saw was
very heavy over in Cumberland. To-
day is a degree brisker still, tho with
remnants of thunder-clouds still hang-
ing, so we fancy the Flood is about
terminating~ and the broken weather go-
ing to heal itself again. Jamie has some
cattle rather suffering by the epidemic,
which, in the last year, has destroyed
several; his bog-hay, too, is of course
much wetted; but he is otherwise get-
ting briskly enough along. You are to
tell James Aitken that there is an ex-
cellent spigot here already for the
water-barrel, so that he need take no
farther heed of that, at least, till he hear
again.
	I could not quite handily get packed
(owing to Garthwaites tailoring) for this
day; so I put it off till Monday; and
am fixed for that morning (10 A. M.)
to be in Edinburgh about one oclock
and over in Kirkcaldy in good time,
where Jane, as I conclude, is arrived
since yesterday and expects me against
the given time. Give my kindest re-
membrances in Assembly Street; what
our further movements from Kirkcaldy
are to be, Jean or some of you will hear
in due time. No more at present, dear
Sister, with many blessings to you all.
	Ever your Affectionate Brother,
T.	CARLYLE.


	In 1850 the Latter-Day Pamphlets
were published. In spite of the outcry
against them, Carlyles regular pub-
lic was not disturbed. Froude esti-
mates that about three thousand persons
were then buying whatever he wrote.
	Carlyle said in his Journal for Oc-
tober of the same year: Four weeks
(September) at Scotsbrig: my dear old
Mother, much broken since I had last
seen her, was a perpetual source of sad
and, as it were, sacred emotion to me.
Sorrowful mostly and disgusting, and
even degrading, were my other emo-
tions. God help me!
	The next letter concerns the depar-
ture of Mrs. Hanning to join her hus-
band in Canada. It is the only one in
this collection from Mrs. Thomas Car-
lyle. Jane is Carlyles sister, Jean
Aitken,  Jane only by courtesy, he
somewhere says.</PB>

Mv DEAR JENNY,  I sent off yester-
day by railway to Janes care a bundle
of things which I hope may be of some
use to you in your preparation for de-
parture. They are not much worth as
they are, but you have a great talent  at
least you had when I knew you  for
making silk purses out of sows ears, a
very valuable talent in this world. For
the rest what can I say to you but that
I wish you good speed in your great ad-
venture, and that it may turn out even
better for you than you hope. Decided-
ly it is an adventure in which you ought
to be let please yourself, to be let fol-
low the guidance of your own heart
without remonstrance or criticism of
others. It is my fixed opinion that be-
tween man and wife no third person
can judge, and that all any of us could
reasonably require of you is that you
should consider well what you are about
to do and that you should do nothing
from secondary motives. If it be affec-
tion for your husband and the idea of
doing your duty by him that takes you
from your family and friends so far
away, then go in Gods name, and may
your husband prove himself worthy of
so much constancy. In any case you
will have no cause for self reproach.
But if it be impatience of your position
here which. is driving you away from
your kind old Mother and all the rest
who love you so well, then God help
you, my poor Jenny, for you are fling-
ing away all the real blessings of your
lot for an imagination of independence.
I hope, however, you are quite justified
by your feelings towards your husband
in leaving all to follow him. You have
always seemed to me to cherish a most
loyal affection for your husband, and I
will never believe, however appearances
may be against him, that a man can in-
spire such an affection in the wife he
has lived years beside and yet be wholly
unworthy of it. So farewell, dear Jenny,
and God go with you.
Affectionately yours,
JANE CARLYLE.


	By 1851 Carlyle had begun to think
seriously of Frederick the Great as his
next subject, and it soon became evident
that he must walk in whatever footsteps
of his hero were still visible. Carlyle
reached Rotterdam September 1, 1852,
at noon, and was there met by Mr.
Neuberg,  a German admirer, says
Froude, a gentleman of good private
fortune, resident in London, who had
volunteered his services to conduct Car-
lyle over the Fatherland, and afterwards
to be his faithful assistant in the  Fred-
erick biography. Carlyle returned to
England in October, but many distrac-
tions  among them repairs in Cheyne
Row and the funeral of the Duke of
Wellington  kept him from starting
with Frederick. During the winter he
wrote something, and threw it aside.
On the 13th of April, 1853, he wrote in
his Journal, Still struggling and hag-
gling about Frederick.
	There is neither struggling nor hag-
gling, however, in the letter which fol-
lows. The Talbottypes mentioned
here were, like Daguerreotypes, glim-
mering prophecies of the merciless pho-
tograph.

	Mv DEAR JENNY,  Though it is a
long time since I have written to you,
no mistake can be greater than that I
have forgotten you. No, no, there is
no danger of that. My memory at
least is active enough! But I live in
such a confused whirlpool of hurries
here as you can have no conception of,
and always in poor weak health, too,
and in corresponding spirits, and for
most part when my poor stroke of work
for the day is done (if alas, I be lucky</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00691" SEQ="0691" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="685">	Unpublished Letters of Carl yle.	685

enough to get any work done one day in
ten, as days now go!)  I have in gen-
eral nothing for it but to shut up my
ugly cellar of confusions and address
myself to the task of being silent 
writing no letter whatever but those I
absolutely cannot help. That is the real
truth and you must not measure my re-
gard for you by the quantity I write, but
by quite other standard.
	We regularly see your letters here
and are very glad indeed to observe
that you get on so well. The fits of
ague-fever you had at first were a se-
vere introduction and began to be
alarming to us, but I can hope now it
was only the hanselling of you in
your new climate, and that henceforth
you will go on with at least your old
degree of health. One thing I have
understood to be of great moment (in-
deed I am sure of it), in the Canada
climate; it is to take good care that
your house be in an airy situation, quite
free from the neighbourhood of damp
ground, especially of stagnant water,
arid with a free exposure to the wind.
That undoubtedly is of great impor-
tance. You are accustomed from sound
old Annandale to take no thought at all
about such things, but you may depend
upon it they are necessary and indis-
pensable considerations in your new
country. I beg you very much to keep
them earnestly in view with reference
to the house you live in. Plenty of dry
wind, all marshes &#38; c. at a distance, arid
there is no more danger of ague in Canada
than in Scotland; that you shove up
your windows in season and keep your
house clean as a new pin  these are
advices I need not give, for you follow
these, of course, of nature or inveterate
habit, being from of old one of the neat-
est little bodies to be found in five
Parishes! In all remaining respects I
find you have chosen clearly for the bet-
ter, and I doubt not are far happier
in your re-united household than you
ever were or could have been in Dum
fries. It was a wise and courageous
adventure of you to take the Ocean by
the face in search of these objects, and
all your friends rejoice to learn that it
has succeeded. Long and richly may
you reap the rewards of your quiet, stout
and wise behaviour  then and all along,
under circumstances that were far froni
easy to manage; and Gods blessing be
on you always, my poor little Jenny! I
hope, too, poor Robert has learned many
a thing and forgotten many a thing in
the course of his hard fortune and wide
wanderings. Give him my best wishes,
teThporal and spiritual. Help him faith-
fully what you can, and he (for he has
a kind enough heart) will do the like by
you  and so we hope all will be better
with you both than it is with many, and
continue to grow better and better to the
end. I recommend myself to the nice
gleg little lasses whom I shall not forget,
but always think of as little, however
big they grow. My blessing on you
all.
	No doubt you know by eyesight whom
these two Talbottypes represent; mine
is very like  Janes (done by a differ-
ent process) is not quite so like, but it
will serve for remembrance. I begged
two pairs of them awhile ago and had
one sent to Alick (Jane slightly differ-
ent in his set), the other pair I now send
to you and wish only it were some use-
fuller gift. However, they will eat no
bread and so you may give them dry
lodging, that is all they want.
	I heard from the Dr. at Moffat the
day before yesterday. He reports our
good old Mother being in her usual way
and now with the better prospect of sum-
mer ahead. Poor Mother, she is now very
feeble, but her mind is still all there and
we should be thankful. The rest are
well. John is to quit Moffat in July.
Jane sends her kind regards.

wretched little messin-dog Nero ; a
very unsuccessful part of the drawing,

XXXVI. CARLYLE TO MRS. EARNING, CANADA.

800T5BRIG, EUCLEFECHAN, 28 Dec. 1853.

	Mv DEAR SISTER,  This letter brings
very sorrowful news to you, probably
the sorrowfullest I may ever have to
send from Scotsbrig. Our dear and
good old Mother is no more: she went
from us, gently and calmly at last, on
the Sunday just gone (Christmas Day
the 25th) at four or ten minutes past
four in the afternoon: The Dr., Jean,
Isabella, Jamie, and I standing in sor-
rowfur reverence at her bed-side; our
poor suffering Mother had lain in a heavy
kind of sleep for about 16 hours befoie;
and died at last, rather unexpectedly to
the watchers, so sudden was it, without
struggle or seeming pain of any kind.
We had to think Her sufferings are
over; and she has fought her fight well
and nobly; and as for us,  we are
left here alone; and the soul that never
ceased to love us since we came into the
world, is gone to God, her Maker and
ours. This is the heavy news I have
to send you, dear Sister; and nobody
cau spare you the sorrow and tears it
will occasion. For above a year-and-a-
half past, our dear Mother had been
visibly falling fast away; when I saw
her in August gone a year, her weakness
and sufferings were quite painful to
me; and it seemed uncertain whether
we should ever meet again in this scene
of things. She had no disease at that
time nor afterwards, but the springs ef
life were worn out, there was no strength
left. Within the last six months the
decay proceeded faster and was con-
stant: she could not much rise from
bed; she needed Mary and Jean alter-
nately to watch always over her,  lat-
terly it was Jean alone (Mary not being
strong enough); and surely Jean has
earned the gratitude of us all, and done
a work that was blessed and beautiful,
in so standing by her sacred task, and
so perf6rming it as she did. There has
been no regular sleep to her for months
past, often of late weeks and days not
much sleep of any kind: but her affec-
tionate patience, I think, never failed.
I hope, though she is much worn out,
she will not permanently suffer: and
surely she will not want her reward.
Our noble Mother too behaved like her-
self in all stages of her illness; never
quaiied into terror, lamentation or any
weak temper of mind; had a wonder-
ful clearness of intellect, clearness of
heart, affection, piety and simple cour-
age and beauty about her to the very
end. She passed much of her time in
the last weeks iii a kind of sleep; used
to awaken with a smiles (as John de-
scribed it to me), and has left a sacred
remembrance with all of us consolatory
in our natural grief.
	I have written to Alick this day, a
good many other details, and have bid-
den him send you the letter (which is
larger and fuller than this),  as you
probably in asking for it will send this
to him. I am in great haste, to-mor-
row (Thursday 29th Dec.) being the
funeral day, and many things occupy-
ing us still. I will therefore say no
more here; your little pieces of worldly
business will, I hope, be satisfactorily
and easily adjusted before I return to
Chelsea, and then it will be somebodys
task (Johns or mine) to write to you
again. For the present I will only bid,
God bless you, dear sister, you and
yours;  and teach you to bear this
great sorrow and bereavement (which
is one chiefly to your heart, but to her a
blessed relief) in the way that is fit, and
worthy of the brave and noble Mother
we have had, but have not any longer.
Your affectionate Brother,
T.	CARLYLE.


	With a few days excepted, the Car-
lyles spent the whole of the year 1854 in
London. There was little but the Cri-
mean war to distract Carhyles attention
from his long struggle with Frederick.

CARLYLE AS A LETTER-WRITER.

	MOST persons  perhaps because, con-
sciously or unconsciously, they hold the
opinion of George Eliot, that serious
subjects should not be discussed iu let-
ters  try to entertain their correspond-
ents, when they sit down to write a
friendly letter. Famous writers are no
exception to this rule. Horace Walpole
adapts his materials with the nicest art;
Gray is seldom elegiac iu prose; and
Chesterfield, not content with urging
his son to sacrifice to the Graces,
makes his own epistles an oblation on
the altar of those ladies. It is evident
that the younger Pliny chooses his best
stylus, whether a rfuscan villa, or the
eruption of Vesuvius, or a Corinthian
statuette form his theme; and the fact
that all is composed in fear of Cicero
and to the glory of the Latin language
cannot have made the composition less
acceptable to his contemporaries. The
letters of Charles Lamb, the argument
of whose life was suited to a Greek tra-
gedy, must often have carried sunshine
	quaintly filtered through Lambs per-
sonality  to people who, had they but
known it, were far better off than their
correspondent. Cowper, the best of Eng-
lish letter-writers, was also one of the
most cheerful, and in some of the last
communications with his friends, before
the darkness had quite settled over him,
showed himself touchingly conscious of
the social bond. It was nearly always
dark with Cowper when he was ad-
dressing the Reverend John Newton,
the evil genius who tried to be his good
genius; but let it be remembered that
Cowper wrote to Newton the escape
of the hares,  a miniature ~ilpin in
prose. Most of what came from Olney
and Weston, indeed, gave and repeated
an impression of sprightly serenity that
	except in the letters to Newton 
seldom allowed itself to be clouded with
the fear which so often kept Cowper
trembling. When Madame de S6vign6
smiles through her tears, her face turned
always toward her daughter, we love
her most. We do not feel that she is
not making the best of things, but mere-
ly that the gayety of her century, thus
dashed, is brought nearer the key of our
own.
	Looked at from this point of view of
good spirits, whether real or benevo-
lently feigned, Carlyle is in blackest
contrast to the genial tradition of let-
ter-writing. As early as when he was
with the Bullers at Kinnaird, he had
frightened his family with an eloquent
diagnosis of the torments of dyspepsia,
and afterward often practiced a becom-
ing caution in complaining too loudly of
anything to them. Toward the world
in general, however, and toward his bro-
ther John  who alone of the family
lived in the world  he seldom observed
such care. What he felt, he thought;
and what he thought, he wrote. The
denunciatory mood was frequent with
Carlyle, and it would be easy to collect
enough of his secular anathemas for a
droll sort of commination service. Men,
women, and children, if they disturbed
him, came in for his curse. All an-
noyances spoke to Carlyle and his wife
through a megaphone, and were pro-
claimed by them through a still larger
variety of the same instrument. Every
cock that crowed near their house was a
clarion out of tune, and the demon-
fowls were equaled by dogs, of which
each had to their ears the barking pow-
er of Cerberus. When Carlyle traveled,
fierce imprecations upon everything vi-
atic were wafted back from every stage
to the poor Goody in Cheyne Row,
often while she was facing alone the pro-
blem of fresh paint and paper. On the

lyle himself being at home during re-
pairs, they were to him what a convul-
sion of nature would be to most of us,
and his outcries were of cosmic vehe-
mence and shrillness. In these wild
splutterings of genius, a maid servant
was a puddle, a scandalous randy,
or even a sluttish harlot; a man ser-
vant was a flunkey, and if he waked
Carlyle too early in the morning he was
a flunkey of the devil. Rank, wealth,
and worldly respectability were, it need
not at this day be said, no defense against
these grotesque indictments. The clergy
and lovers of the clergy  unless, in-
deed, they happened to be arnemic and
Socinian  were always accused of
shovel-hattedness. Persons who, from
Plato to Scott, waged no visible warfare
with their own souls, and lived their
lives without stated conversion from the
everlasting No, were rarely acceptable
to Carlyle. Any man of his acquaintance
who, besides being thus at ease in Zion,
had also gathered worldly gear, was apt,
according to Carlyle, to have lost his
humanity in gigmanity. London, in
the word he gladly borrowed from Cob-
bett, was a  monstrous wen;  Europe,
a huge suppuration; mankind, most-
ly fools; and the world at large, a
dusty, fuliginous chaos.
	If, in moods which give forth such
words, Carlyle seems to write with a quill
plucked from the fretful porpentine, a
new book of Lamentations might be ga-
thered from his other frequent and fa-
miliar condition. This was the state of
body and soul which moved him to sor-
row and repining over himself, England,
and the world. If he had never made
his great success in literature, these wail-
ing cries might plausibly be assigned to
the disappointed ambitions of a man
whose lot was even more embittered by
dyspepsia. But in this respect the tone
of the apprentice, throughout a wean-
fully long apprenticeship, was strangely
like that of the past master in literature,
who for the last twenty years of his life
was the most eminent of English writers.
There is doubtless a habit of mourning
as of rejoicing, and habit counted for
much with Carlyle. Yet what I am dis-
posed to contend is that though Alad-
dins lamp had lighted him to a success
even earlier than Sheridans or Kip-
lings, his books and letters would still
from time to time have sounded the
whole gamut of Jeremiah. It was in
his Scotch blood that thus they should,
 in his Puritan spirit and his Puritan-
ical digestion. In short, Carlyles mel-
ancholy was from temperament far more
than from circumstance,  a spiritual
habitude to which he was destined and
born.
	See the sparks fly upward in March,
1822: Art is long and life is short;
and of the three score and ten years
allotted to the liver, how small a por-
tion is spent in anything bnt vanity and
vice, if not in wretchedness, and worse
than unprofitable struggling with the
adamantine laws of fate! I am wae
when I think of all this, but it cannot
be helped. More than forty years
after, the sad-eyed victor in his chosen
field reminds us that he, more than
most men, is born to trouble. In 1865
he writes to Emerson from Annandale:
I live in total solitude, sauntering
moodily in thin checkered woods, gal-
loping about, once daily, by old lanes
and roads, oftenest latterly on the wide
expanses of Solway shore (when the
tide is out!) where I see bright busy
Cottages far off, houses over even in
Cumberland, and the beautifulest am-
phitheatre of eternal Hills,  but meet
no living creature; and have endless
thoughts as loving and as sad and som-
bre as I like. This is none the less
(perhaps, rather, the more) sad, for all
the wide ~nd shining landscape. A few
lines later Carlyle says: You perceive
me sufficiently at this point of my Pil-
grimage, as withdrawn to Hades for the
time being; intending a months walk
there, till the muddy semi-solutions set-</PB>

tie into sediment according to what laws
they have, and there be perhaps a par-
tial restoration of clearness. The voice
of 1865, though early in the interim it
gained its individual accent, is still the
voice of 1822.
	Malice was operant in this choice of
a passage from one of Carlyles letters
to Emerson, to show the frequent hue
of his spirit. For not only is the mere
thought of Emerson a cause of cheer to
most men,  to Carlyle himself it usual-
ly brought comfort,  but Carlyle had
adopted Emerson, or more nearly adopt-
ed him than any one else except Ster-
ling, into the close communion of his
own family, toward whom he generally
showed compunction in the niatter of
invective and lament. Yet in writing to
Emerson and to them he would some-
times forget his restraint, and, while eat-
ing his heart, would invite them to the
same repast. It has been said that
Froude made an exceptionally gloomy
selection from Carlyles correspondence,
and that Mr. Nortons volumes give a
fairer view of the habitual tone of his
spirits. So far as they are concerned
with Emerson and with Carlyles kin-
dred, an explanation of the higher aver-
age of cheerfulness has already been
offered. But even in these letters, and
still more in the rest of Mr. Nortons se-
lections, one is tempted to inquire whether
he did not intend (and very properly)
to redress the balance which Froude
had unduly weighted on the other side.
For the essence and gist of Carlyles
published writings  books, letters, and
journals  is that it is not a merry
place, this world; it is a stern and aw-
ful place. Much that is meat to other
men was poison, or tinctured with poi-
son, to him. My letter, you will see
(he wrote to his brother John in 1828),
ends in sable, like the life of man.
My own thoughts grow graver every
day I live. He could, and did, suck
melancholy from his own successful lec-
tures, from his own hooks and the
	VOL LXXXII.  No. 493.	44
books 9f others, from the state of the
nation and the state of his own health,
from society, from solitude. Craigen-
puttock, high on the moors between
Dumfriesshire and Galloway, and six-
teen miles from the town of Dumfries,
has always seemed to me the right scenic
background for Carlyle. The stone farm-
house, surrounded by a few acres of land
reclaimed from peat bog, stands in the
midst of bleak hills, seven hundred feet
above the level of the sea. This is the
right scenery for Carlyle, and many of
his most characteristic letters, from what-
ever places written, carry with them a
feeling of the north, November, and the
moors. Had Froude left any gaps in his
biography, they might be bridged with
sighs.
	Persons who talked with Carlyle, or
who heard him talk, often received a dif-
ferent impression. This was, no doubt,
partly because his pentecostal gift excit-
ed him to a variety and fire of speech for
which he afterward paid the penalty of a
natural enough reaction; partly, also, be.
cause the sense of humor never deserted
him at those moments, and rich gusts of
laughter swept away boding prophecy,
fierce invective, and the whole symbol-
ic apparatus of Carlylean denunciation.
Humor, indeed, is always to be reckoned
with in Carlyle; and his letters, like his
books, abound in a range of it  seldom
genial  that extends from the grim to
the farcical. But you cannot hear a man
laugh in print; and where in a Carlyle
conversation the stage direction would
be, Exit laughing, in a Carlyle letter
it appears, Exit groaning or Exit
swearing. The writer laughs off,
as Macbeth and Macduff fight off;
and the reader hears but the ghost of a
laugh,  a faint, imagined reverberation.
	Hence, loath~d Melancholy, and a
truce to sable. I have, perhaps, made
too much of a striking characteristic,
however indubitable, of a great writer.
The famous rat was not always gnawing
at the pit of his stomach; and when</PB>

neither the mood of vituperation nor the
mood of lament was upon him, he was
of too vigorous and too honest a mind
not to discuss with comparative calm-
ness many subjects that interested him.
What did interest him and what did nt,
what appears in his letters and what is
never seen there, would make a cata-
logue fairly descriptive of Carlyles in-
tellectual and moral constitution. Food
and raiment he seldom writes of, save as
necessities of life. No Christmas gas-
tronomy in his letters, no rule for cook-
ing a chub, no incipient essay on roast
pig. As Carlyles pen is never occupied
with cards, one concludes that old wo-
men to play whist with of an evening, so
much desired by a certain delightful let-
ter-writer, were not a desideratum with
him. Women, in fact, play no domi.
nantly feminine part in his life. Love,
as a passion, he apparently does not un-
derstand. He gave no more sensitive
response to the fine arts than Emerson,
in whose books there are many blind
places,  so says Mr. Chapman in hi~
original and important essay on Emer-
son,  like the notes which will not
strike on a sick piano. To name the
theatre is, with Carlyle, to scorn it.
Goethe himself could not make him care
for plays or play-acting. Goethes Wil-
helm Meister he learned to admire, al-
though, had any other written it, the book
would have had from him the treatment
it got from Wordsworth. If we may
believe Froude, Carlyle called some of
the most noteworthy French novels a
new Phallus worship, with Sue, Baizac,
and Co. for prophets, and Madame Sand
for a virgin. Poetry, art allied to his
own, interests Carlyle only through its
thought or its lesson. In the actual af-
fairs of life, he desires neither money,
rank, nor political power. He gives no
adherence to any religious creed, politi-
cal faith, or party leader. He often feels
himself in a minority of one, but on
a certain occasion doubles the number,
to include Emerson.
	Here may end, without special reason
for ending, the catalogue of negatives
by which people learn to know Carlyle
in his letters. Shorter, not less impres-
sive or informing, is the list of positives.
Words Carlyle must have had at least a
sneaking fondness for. He does not ad-
mit it, but he uses words and phrases in a
way that tells its own story to those upon
whose ears his noblest strains fall like
music. Very often, as he intended, the
words stand for facts, which he loved,
and for which he was proud to tell his
love. Purity, honor, and truth are dear
to Carlyle, and he celebrates them in his
letters. Pauvre et triste hu2nanit6, al.
though it often moves him to scorn, never
quite loses its hold upon him: his letters
are a crowded thoroughfare of human
beings, who live again at his touch.
Good sayings  pious, shrewd, sage, or
humorous, as the case may be  this
eloquent talker rolls under his tongue,
especially when they are in the speech
of the Scottish people. His taste for hu-
mor is catholic enough to relish jokes;
and he himself, unclannish chiefly in
that, jokes without difficulty. Strength
of any kind bulks so large in Carlyles
esteem that the historian of Cromwell
and Friedrich has often been accused of
making might his right. After years of
what he felt to be misrepresentation, he
endeavored to set things straight by de-
claring that right, in the long run, was
pretty sure to be mighty. However this
may be, the strength of contemporary
leaders was likely, by his thinking, to be
founded on unrighteousness; and it was
easier for him to worship his heroes
through the long nave of the past. There
was an altar for Cromwell, but  alas
that it should have been so  there was
none for Lincoln.
	Although these positives are lengthen-
ing themselves out, there must be men-
tion here of the mother, wife, family,
and friends, who figure so engrossingly
in Carlyles correspondence. I think
we gather from the grand total of docu</PB>

ments in the case that he loved his mother
more deeply and singly than he loved
any other person. Yet for his wife he
had a strong, often disquieted affection.
The expression of this in his letters to
her, which are as remarkable for erno-
tion as for a very high order of writing,
is of course less checkered than it could
have been in the faring together of two
such yoke - fellows. In the action of
temperament upon temperament, similia~
similibus nort curantur. During the
long episode of Gloriana, it is often pos-
sible to read between the lines of Car-
lyles letters to his wife. After the death
of the first Lady Ashburton, however,
occurs the most striking passage of self-
accusation to be found in any letter be.
fore the death of Mrs. Carlyle. Carlyle
writes to her on the 11th of July, 1858:
	All yesterday I remarked, in speak-
ing to , if any tragic topic came in
sight, I had a difficulty to keep from
breaking down in my speech, and be-
coming inarticulate with emotion over it.
It is as if the scales were falling from
my eyes, and I were beginning to see in
this, my solitude, things that touch me
to the very quick. Oh, my little wo-
man! what a suffering thou hast had,
and how nobly borne! with a simplicity,
a silence, courage, and patient heroism
which are only now too evident to me.
Three waer days I can hardly remember
in my life; but they were not without
worth either; very blessed some of the
feelings, though many so sore and mis-
erable. It is very good to be left alone
with the truth sometimes, to hear with
all its sternness what it will say to one.
	It is often to be noted that no great
moment finds Carlyle without a great
word. Moving as is the utterance just
quoted, it is dumb in comparison with
this, written after the death of Mrs.
Carlyle: Not for above two days could
I estimate the immeasurable depths of
it, or the infinite sorrow which had peeled
my life all bare, and in a moment shat-
tered my poor world to universal ruin.
	Mother, wife, family, and one or two
friends, then, were very dear to Car-
lyle. Love me a little, he writes once
to Emerson. Next to these few per-
sons, nature had perhaps the strongest
sway over him; and the strange, beau-
tiful landscapes that shine out from some
of his darkest letters would be enough
to found a reputation on. The phrases
live in ones memory as if they had line
and color.
	Two main facts detach themselves, I
think, from these imperfect suggestions
of what Carlyles letters contain and
what they are vacant of. In the first
place, no one can doubt that although
 except in writing to the Annandale
kin  Carlyle seldom attempts to con-
trol himself, is seldom interesting or en-
tertaining of set purpose, he is yet, for
interest and entertainment, a letter-wri-
ter among a thousand. Single-minded
and single - hearted, true as the very
truth, in the words of his mouth he ut-
ters the meditations of his heart. Gifted
with eloquence, with humor, with pathos,
with eyes that see everything and a
memory that loses nothing, with an en-
ergy of speech which (compared with
that given to the majority of his fellow
creatures) is clearly superhuman, Carlyle
uses his amazing literary vehicle as an
Arabian magic carpet to transport him
to his correspondent. The letter is the
writer; the word is the man.
	So much for one fact. The other,
not now stated for the first time, is
that Carlyle, in his familiar letters as in
his published works, presents the curious
combination of mystic and realist. The
world that can be tested by the senses
is, in Carlyles belief, only the vesture,
sometimes muddy, sometimes clear, of
the divine principle. For many readers,
the expression of this ruling idea of Car-
lyle and his work is confused not only
by apparently contradictory phrasings,
but by the shifting of his conception
of God between theism and pantheism.
When, however, Carlyle utters himself</PB>

most earnestly and most characteristical-
ly on this cardinal point of his belief,
no manner of man can misunderstand
him. Matter, exclaims he, exists
only spiritually, and to represent some
idea and body it forth. Heaven and
Earth are but the time-vesture of the
Eternal. The Universe is but one vast
symbol of God; nay, if thou wilt have
it, what is man himself but a symbol of
God? Is not all that he does symbolical,
a revelation to sense of the mystic God-
given force that is in him ?  a gospel
of Freedom, which he, the Messias of
Nature, preaches as he can by act and
word. It was only to be expected that
the favorite quotation of a man whose
high belief can be stated thus, of a man
who regarded time as an illusion, should
be the lines from Shakespeares Tem~
pest : 
We are such stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep.

	Now, although it is proverbially diffi-
cult to prove a negative, the ease with
which a negative can be stated should be
equally matter of proverb. According-.
ly, we find that Carlyle, in his letters, a
hundred times denounces the world as
he sees it for once that he describes, or
even suggests, the world as he would see
it.	Silent heroes should be the rulers of
England. Silent heroes are rare birds,
even among the dead. Instead of them,
talking parliamentarians are at the head
of things; and Carlyle has to say what
he thinks of Gladstone and Disraeli, the
alternately ruling talkers. When, in
1874, Disraeli proposed to grant him a
pension and bestow on him also the Grand
Cross of the Bath, he wrote to John
Carlyle: I do, however, truly admire
the magnanimity of Dizzy in regard to
me. He is the only man ill almost never
spoke of except with contempt.
	Men of letters fare no better than men
of action. They should be priests, in
white, unspotted robes. What does Car-
lyle find them? In 1824, after pinning
Coleridge, De Quincey, Hazlitt, and
Leigh Hunt fiercely to the page, he
writes to Miss Welsh: Good heavens!
I often inwardly exclaim, and is this
the literary world ? This rascal rout,
this dirty rabble, destitute not only of
high feeling and knowledge or intellect,
but even of common honesty! The very
best of them are ill-natured weaklings.
They are not red-blooded men at all.
	Such is the literary world of Lon-
don; indisputably the poorest part of its
population at present. So Carlyle wrote
of writers when he was putting on his
literary armor, and not very differently
when he was putting it off. His Hero
as Man of Letters was almost invariably
seen at a distance, either of time or
space. He spitted Coleridge on his sharp-
est spear, and two blasting, withering
descriptions of Charles Lamb  with
forty years between them for reflection
 remain to the everlasting hurt of
Carlyles own reputation.
	Vitriol blesseth neither him that gives
nor him that takes, yet Carlyle stayed
to the end of his many days essentially
high-minded. Honorable, simple, help-
ful, charitable in deed though not in
word, he was seen at the limit of his
course to have a better heart, a charac-
ter less deteriorated, than many a man
 no less good at the start  who has
indulged himself with omitting the
negative proposition. The habit of
scorn would in the long run have been
more harmful to character than the habit
of tolerance and facile praise, except
that Carlyle had an extraordinarily high
standard of principle and performance,
and held to it not only in his judgment
of others, but also in what he exacted of
himself. The fact that Carlyle never tried
to reconcile the inconsistency (as it may
have seemed to some persons) between
the Deity of his worship and the sym-
bolic manifestations of that Deity in a
world so little to Carlyles liking no
doubt helped him to keep his spiritual
integrity.</PB>

	In company and contrast with the mys-
ticism of Carlyles thought  idealism
is the better word, if it be strictly in-
terpreted  is the eager realism of his
literary methods. As a result of this
piquant union, Carlyle means one thing
to one man, and another, quite different
thing to another man. The Carlyle of
X, the strait idealist, is a moonish phi-
losopher, to be shunned by A, the strait
realist, who rejoices in the closely packed
narrative, the wild action, and the por-
traits of men and women, that make but
a trivial appeal to X. This union of na-
tures is plain enough in Shakespeare, in
whom nothing surprises. The hand which
gave us the Tempest gave us also Juli-
ets nurse and Hotspurs description of
a certain Lord. Too often, however,
the idealists grasp of the concrete is wa-
vering and intermittent; too often the
soul of the realist needs little feeding.
	Carlyle vibrated between these two
elements of his nature, and fortified one
with the other. When, after burrowing
in the dust-heap of the past or fishing into
the general Mother of Dead Dogs,
he had brought to light some pearl (or,
it might be, only some oyster-shell) of
fact, he often improved the opportunity
to show the larger significance of the lit-
tle gleam or glint of reality. It was the
defect of a fine quality that, in his later
work, and especially in Frederick, he
spent himself on irrelevant facts which
helped to make Carlyles longest book a
splendid failure, with episodes of indu-
bitable success.
	The looser form of the letter more
properly admits the isolated concrete.
Shrewd, welcome bits of fact are every-
where in Carlyles letters; everywhere,
too, are those other expressions of a
great realist,  vividly composed ele-
ments of landscape, and portraits that
give every token of life except breath.
As with every artist, whatever he de-
picts takes color from him, and is seen
through his temperament. In the sum-
mer of 1837 Carlyle writes to Sterling
from Scotsbrig: One night, late, I rode
through the village where I was born.
The old kirkyard tree, a huge old gnarled
ash, was nestling itself softly against the
great twilight in the north. A star or
two looked out, and the old graves were
all there, and my father and my sister;
and God was above us all. Here be
worn, familiar things. Gray has been
to the village churchyard at the hour of
parting day, and a procession has fol-
lowed in his footsteps. But this kirk-
yard, where Carlyle has since laid him-
self down with his kindred, is Carlyles.
	The reappearance (usually heightened
or elaborated) of bits of prospect or to-
pography first recorded in Carlyles let-
ters is an interesting characteristic of his
writing. His first visit to Paris was of
much service to him in fixing the places
and scenes of The French Revolution;
the trip into the country of Cromwells
birth and the examination of Naseby
field come into sight again in the book,
	witness especially the Cease your
fooling, and the troopers teeth that bit
into Carlyles memory; and a number
of rough drafts for details of Frederick
appear in letters from the Continent. A
brief note, during a visit to Mr. Redwood
in 1843, of the Glamorganshire green
network of intricate lanes, mouldering
ruins, vigorous vegetation good and bad,
was afterward dilated (in the Life of
Sterling) into the spacious and beauti-
ful landscape beginning: Llanblethian
hangs pleasantly, with its white cottages,
and orchard and other trees, on the
western slope of a green hill; looking
far and wide over green meadows and
little or bigger hills, in the pleasant plain
of Glamorgan.
	Distinguished as are Carlyles por-
traits of places, it is probably his por-
traits of persons that abide longest and
most completely in the memories of most
readers. Robespierre, Mirabeau and Mi-
rabeau pare, Frederick and Frederick
William,  it is one sign of Carlyles
power that he can make subordinate</PB>

characters salient and still bring out his
hero,  Voltaire, Cromwell, and the Ab-
bot Samson, are a few of the pictures
that line his galleries. Wonderful as are
these renderings of men he never saw,
his sketches of men he had known are
almost literally  speaking ~
Coleridge, Leigh Hunt, Dickens, Thack-
eray, Tennyson, Mazzini, Louis iNapo-
leon, are among the many who are
painted to a miracle in Carlyles letters.
Behold a great American, in a letter to
Emerson 
Not many days ago I saw at break-
fast the notablest of all your Notabili-
ties, Daniel Webster. He is a magni-
ficent specimen; you might say to all
the world, This is your Yankee English-
man, such Limbs we make in Yankee-
land! As a Logic-fencer, Advocate, or
Parliamentary Hercules, one would in-
cline to back him at first sight against
all the extant world. The tanned com-
plexion, that amorphous craglike face;
the dull black eyes under their precipice
of brows, like dull anthracite furnaces,
needing only to be blown; the mastiff-
mouth, accurately closed  I have not
traced as much of silent Berserker-rage,
that I remember of, in any other man.
I guess I should not like to be your
nigger!
	At the risk of numbering this paper
with the books of Chrysippus, we must
look again at the portrait of De Quincey,
which is, perhaps, the artists chief tri-
umph. Although it is to be found in the
Reminiscences, it yet belongs here well
enough, for that book is not so much a
book as a long, rambling letter, partly
of remorse, partly of pity, from Car-
lyle to himself. He was a pretty little
creature, says this terrible, sad old man,
remembering after forty years, full of
wire-drawn ingenuities; bankrupt enthu-
siasms, bankrupt pride; with the finest
silver-toned low voice, and most elaborate
gently-winding courtesies and ingenuities
of conversation: What would nt one
give to have him in a Box, and take him
out to talk! (That was Her criticism of
him; and it was right good.) A bright,
ready and melodious talker; but in the
end an inconclusive and long - winded.
One of the smallest man-figures I ever
saw; shaped like a pair of tongs; and
hardly above five feet in all: when he
sat, you would have taken him, by candle-
light, for the beautifullest little Child;
blue-eyed, blonde-haired, sparkling face,
 had there not been a something too,
which said, Eccovi, this Child has been
in Hell!  One would be sure, without
other evidence than Her criticism in
thi~ description, which is also a charac-
ter,  to use the old word,  that She,
too, had been terrible. The broken or-
der, the curious punctuation, the capitals
and italics, the leave of absence granted
to the verb, the quick interjections, all
taken together make the passage a con-
centrated example of Carlyles vox hu-
mana style,  of his writing when it is
most like speech, sublimated.
	In his use of persons, as of places,
there are pregnant comparisons to be
made between Carlyles first study and
the final portrait. Sterling and old Ster-
ling are cases in point; Coleridge, per-
haps, the best instance of all. The main
lines and the personal atmosphere, al-
ways visible, I think, in the sketch, are
reproduced by Carlyle in the finished
work. But in the heightening of lights,
in the deepening of shade, in composi-
tion, above all, he makes many changes,
which almost invariably result in greater
intensity of effect.
	From such comparisons, if patiently
conducted, might come luminous com-
ment on the question of Carlyles style,
 a question more vexed than the Ber-
moothes.
	So far and so much for Carlyles gen-
eral aspect as a letter-writer. I have
tried to show that, in addressing himself
to a very few friends, and especially to
his own family, he displays a different
set of qualities. The difference between
his vehemence toward the world at large</PB>

and his gentleness toward his mother
sometimes seems as marked as that be-
tween the two visions of the prophet
Jeremiah: the one a seething ealdron,
the face thereof from the north; the
other, a rod of an almond tree. The
world, in truth, for this peasant of
genius, was, to the considerable degree
in which he remained a peasant, an as-
semblage of persons and things to be
approached with many reserves and a
deal of more or less violent disapproval.
Annandale, contrariwise, was an honest,
strength - giving corner of the world,
which did for him through life the of-
fice of the earth to Anticus. He went
back to it so often that he never lost his
native accent, and, in certain respects,
the point of view to which he was born.
So long as Carlyles mother lived, there
was rarely a year in which he did not
make a pilgrimage to Scotsbrig; ai~id,
after she died, he went oftener to her
grave than most sons, dwelling at a dis-
tance from their mothers, visit them in
life. Scotsbrig also came to him in the
shape of letters, as well as in the un-
sentimental (though, rightly beheld, not
unpathetic) guise of oatmeal, bacon,
clothes, and what not. The Carlyles
held that good meal could not be bought
in London; so, when the barrel wasted,
it was filled again from home. One far-.
brought fowl we all remember as the
epic subject of a letter from Mrs. Car-
lyle in Chelsea to her sister-in-law in
Scotland. Carlyle had his clothes made
in Annan, partly from thrift, partly from
distrust of London tailors.
	However much he depended on the
people and the kindly fruits of his native
soil, however much the exclusiveness of
the Carlyles may have been only that
common to all Scotch peasant families,
it is still hard to credit  though on the
excellent authority of Mrs. Oliphant 
that their mutual love was not by
ordinar, even among Scotch peasants.
Especially is it difficult of credence that
the attachment of Carlyle and his mo
ther was not as rare as it was beauti-
ful. In 1832, after the death of his
father, he writes to his brother Alick,
at Scotsbrig: 0 let us all be gentle,
obedient, loving to our Mother, now
that she is left wholly to our charge!
Honour thy Father and thy Mother:
doubly honour thy Mother when she alone
remains. For twenty years this double
honor was more than trebly paid. The
son writes once to his mother: Since
I wrote last I have been in Scotsbrig
more than in London. And so it often
is to the end,  and after. Dreaming
and waking, he looks far up across Eng-
land and the Solway. In the spring,
the plough and the sower pass between
his eyes and the page of Cromwell or
The French Revolution; in the autumn,
he has a vision of the yellow fields,
of Jamies peat-stack, and the caul-
dron~ singing under his mothers s win-
dow. The mothers trembling thought
of her children answers their love for
her. She told me the other day
(writes one of Carlyles sisters), the
first gaet she gaed every morning was
to London, then to Italy, then to Cmi-
genputtock, and then to Marys, and
finally began to think them at hame
were, maybe, no safer than the rest.
When I asked her what she wished me
to say to you, she said she had a thou-
sand things to say if she had you here;
and thou may tell them, I m very little
fra them.
	As from his first clear earnings Carlyle
sent his father a pair of spectacles, and
his mother a little sovereign to keep
the fiend out of her hussif, so through-
out he never forgot her in the least or
the greatest particular. From year to
year he sent her money and tobacco, 
which they often smoked together in the
farmhouse,  books and comforts and
letters. The letters, of course, were far
the best of all to her. Often as they
came, they could not come often enough.
In 1824 Margaret Carlyle wrote to her
son: Pray do not let me want food;</PB>

as your father says, I look as if I would
eat your letters. Write everything and
soon. Everything and soon it always
was; and in these many letters Carlyle
strove to bring near to the untraveled
ones at home all that he was seeing and
doing. One means of doing this was to
describe interesting places in terms of
Annandale. Thus, in telling his sister
Jean about Naseby, he wrote 
Next day they drove me over some
fifteen miles off to see the field of Naseby
fight  Oliver Cromwells chief battle,
or one of his chief. It was a grand
scene for me  Naseby, a venerable
hamlet, larger than Middlebie, all built
of mud, but trim with high peaked
roofs, and two feet thick of smooth
thatch on them, and plenty of trees
scattered round and among. It is built
as on the brow of the Hagheads at Ec-
clefechan; Cromwell lay with his back to
that, and King Charles was drawn up
as at Wull Welshs  only the Sinclair
burn must be mostly dried, and the hol-
low much wider and deeper.~~
	Carlyle knew that his mother would
be eager to hear of Luther and Luther-
land. In September of the last year
but one of her life, he writes to her from
Weimar that Eisenach is about as big
as Dumfries;  that a hill near by is
somewhat as Locherbie hill is in height
and position. The donjon tower of the
Wartburg (which he translates for her,
Watch Castle) stands like the old Tower
of Repentance on Hoddam Hill, where
his mother had visited him during his
russet-coated idylb there, many years
before. They open a door, you enter
a little apartment, less than your best
room at Scotsbrig, I almost think less
than your smallest, a very poor low room
with an old leaded lattice window; to
me the most venerable of all rooms I
ever entered. That afternoon they
drive to Gotha in a kind of clatch.
Carlyle helps out his English for his
mother with bits of their common Doric,
and falls unconsciously into Scotch locu
tions, such as you would be going or
you would be doing, when he means
you are likely to go  or likely to do.
In larger matters it is the same. Carlyle
may have been chanting the Miserere to
some correspondent, but if he writes to
his mother on the same day the note
changes to Sursum corda, even though
it must visibly struggle up from the
depths. Nor do the Immensities and
the Eternities appear in his letters to
her. In these the Lord her God is also
his God.
	The belief in personal immortality
came to Carlyle, so far as I can discover,
but dimly and infrequently. This chill
lack of faith, so common in our day,
sharpened the dread of his mothers
death. So early as 1844 he writes in his
Journal: My dear old mother has, I
doubt, been often poorly this winter.
They report her well at present: but,
alas! there is nothing in all the earth so
stern to me as that constantly advancing
inevitability, which indeed has terrified
me all my days. Yet, in Carlyles letters
after her death, a dovelike peace seems
to brood over his deep sorrow. With
Roman piety he records the death-trance,
sixteen hours long, in which his mother,
her face as that of a statue, lay wait-
ing for the end. It was another
Dulcis et alta quies, p1acida~que simillima
morti;
and all Carlyles words about that holy
parting are grave and sweet.
	Whatever of loveliness there may
have been in the life together of Car-
lyle and his wife,  and there was
much, in spite of all that has been said
to the contrary,  in death they were
far divided. She lies with her gentle
forbears in the abbey kirk at Hadding-
ton; he, in Ecclefechan kirkyard with
his peasant forbears. When Carlyle
was dying, the Lord remembered for him
the k?ndness of his youth,  his mother
might have believed,  and his mind
seemed to turn altogether to the old Ec-
clefechan days. Said his niece, Mrs.</PB>

Alexander Carlyle, in a letter soon to be
published: He often took Alick for
his father (uncle Sandy), and he would
put his arms round my neck and say to
me, My dear mother.

	Great writer as Carlyle is, many critics
feel that he can never become classical.
The word classic, as Sainte - Beuve
has pointed out, is a stretchable term;
but very possibly the Soudanese lexi-
cographer, descended from a native of
New Zealand, will label many of Car-
lyles phrases post-classical, and place
him with Browning and Ruskin, who
felt his influence, in the Silver Age of
English. Certainly, the Soudanese Quin-
tilian will do well to tell his pupils the
story of Erasmuss ape, and warn them
against the danger of imitating Carlyle.
Classical or post-classical, Carlyles name
is as closely linked with the French
Revolution and the Life of Oliver Crom-
well as is the name of Thucydides with
the Peloponnesian War, that of Tacitus
with the Emperors of the Julian line, or
that ~of Gibbon with the Decline and
Fall of their Empire. Yet even if Car-
lyles historical titles were torn from his
grant of immortality, he would survive
as onc of the most remarkable of Eng-
lish letter-writers.

THE ALCALD-ES VISIT.

	MISSER WILLIAMS had just returned
from the North. He had come down in
the fruit steamer. He had taken Tete
to the North with him to wait upon the
seflora, having borrowed him from the
Sefiorita Carlota. Of the two ladies,
Tete did not know which he adored the
more.
	Misser Williams had lost several val-
uable articles. This he had not discov-
ered until after he had left the steamer,
so that now he was sending Tete back at
once with letters to the American cap-
tain and the Alcalde at Saltona, to see
if they could aid him in finding out the
whereabouts of his belongings.
	Tete had tried to catch a ride on the
fruit train, but Garcia was inexorable.
His orders were that the peons, natives,
workingmen, and boys should not be al-
lowed to travel thus through the planta-
tions, and Tete must perforce walk all
the way to the companys wharf under
the rays of the scorching sun. As usual,
he was grumbling one moment and smil-
ing the next. The train rumbled down
from a side plantation and ran round
the curve. Tete shook his head. No,
he said. They will not allow that I
ride. And what difference,  I that have
the good legs!
	He ran up the little path that here
arose and skirted the track. The breeze
began to blow upon his face,  the
strong, sweet breeze from the bay. Tete
stopped under a great tree, himself as
straight as a young palm. He stretched
out his arms; his fine, straight hair blew
about his eyes.
	I love to live! he shouted to the
parrots overhead. I love, I love to
live! Their North is fine! Their casas
are grand! But give to me my island,
my breezes, my palms, my bananas, and
my people! A listener would have
thought little Tete a real-estate owner,
a planter, a sovereign.

midday. The cars had arrived long be-

man, was busy counting the bunches as
they were handed over the side.

Alexander Carlyle, in a letter soon to be
published: He often took Alick for
his father (uncle Sandy), and he would
put his arms round my neck and say to
me, My dear mother.

	Great writer as Carlyle is, many critics
feel that he can never become classical.
The word classic, as Sainte - Beuve
has pointed out, is a stretchable term;
but very possibly the Soudanese lexi-
cographer, descended from a native of
New Zealand, will label many of Car-
lyles phrases post-classical, and place
him with Browning and Ruskin, who
felt his influence, in the Silver Age of
English. Certainly, the Soudanese Quin-
tilian will do well to tell his pupils the
story of Erasmuss ape, and warn them
against the danger of imitating Carlyle.
Classical or post-classical, Carlyles name
is as closely linked with the French
Revolution and the Life of Oliver Crom-
well as is the name of Thucydides with
the Peloponnesian War, that of Tacitus
with the Emperors of the Julian line, or
that ~of Gibbon with the Decline and
Fall of their Empire. Yet even if Car-
lyles historical titles were torn from his
grant of immortality, he would survive
as onc of the most remarkable of Eng-
lish letter-writers.
Charles Townsend Copeland.




THE ALCALD-ES VISIT.

	MISSER WILLIAMS had just returned
from the North. He had come down in
the fruit steamer. He had taken Tete
to the North with him to wait upon the
seflora, having borrowed him from the
Sefiorita Carlota. Of the two ladies,
Tete did not know which he adored the
more.
	Misser Williams had lost several val-
uable articles. This he had not discov-
ered until after he had left the steamer,
so that now he was sending Tete back at
once with letters to the American cap-
tain and the Alcalde at Saltona, to see
if they could aid him in finding out the
whereabouts of his belongings.
	Tete had tried to catch a ride on the
fruit train, but Garcia was inexorable.
His orders were that the peons, natives,
workingmen, and boys should not be al-
lowed to travel thus through the planta-
tions, and Tete must perforce walk all
the way to the companys wharf under
the rays of the scorching sun. As usual,
he was grumbling one moment and smil-
ing the next. The train rumbled down
from a side plantation and ran round
the curve. Tete shook his head. No,
he said. They will not allow that I
ride. And what difference,  I that have
the good legs!
	He ran up the little path that here
arose and skirted the track. The breeze
began to blow upon his face,  the
strong, sweet breeze from the bay. Tete
stopped under a great tree, himself as
straight as a young palm. He stretched
out his arms; his fine, straight hair blew
about his eyes.
	I love to live! he shouted to the
parrots overhead. I love, I love to
live! Their North is fine! Their casas
are grand! But give to me my island,
my breezes, my palms, my bananas, and
my people! A listener would have
thought little Tete a real-estate owner,
a planter, a sovereign.
	When Tete reached the wharf it was
midday. The cars had arrived long be-
fore him with their load of green fruit.
The inspector, a large, red-faced Scotch-
man, was busy counting the bunches as
they were handed over the side.
	We feel that the sun shine, but we</PB>

have not the red skin to show, said
Tete. That Seflo Inspecto will soon
be wash away. He maike several river
every minute.
	Tete had joined the peons near, and
stood with them watching the disposition
of their favorite fruit. They gazed with
longing eyes at the bunches which were
thrown overboard, and floated on the
waters of the bay. One might have
been tempted to jump into the water to
save some of the finest five-hand bunches,
but for that scavenger the shark. The
fin which he poked above the surface,
now and then, showed that he was ready
for his next meal at any time.
	And what will you be doing here,
Tete? asked the inspector.
	It is Misser Williams who send me
to Saltona on some messages, seilo.
	Messages?
	Si, sefio. Tetes pouting lip closed
downward like the lid of a trap, at the
suggestion of curiosity in the inspectors
tone.
	And how will you be getting there?
	The Esperauza will carry me, Sefio
Inspecto.
	The inspector went on counting, 
Nine, eight, ten, ten, eight. Suppose
I refuse to let ye go, me lad? Ten,
nine, ten. The inspector almost lost
count of the numbers of bands on the
different bunches.
	The messages of the Misser Williams
must be carry, Sefio Inspecto.
	That will be a poor six-hand bunch,
Petrozo. Throw it overboard. Suppose
I refuse ye, lad  seven, eight, ten, seven.
They will be gctting smaller, Petrozo.
	Those message must go there, Seflo
Inspecto.
	Try it, me lad.
	I will do as the seflo advise.
	Captain, this youngster says he will
be going to Saltona with ye.
	Cant go
	Tete pouted. He did not express his
feeling at once in words. Like others
of the human race, he took it out on
somebody else. He turned and rushed
along the stringpiece of the wharf. He
came to where Antonio Tallaza was sit-
ting. Antonio Tallaza was fishing. Tete
seated himself on the other side of the
piles, his legs hanging down toward the
water. The pile against which he leaned
swayed with his slight weight.
	Those toredos! They will leave them
no wharf at all, the next thing!
	Antonio Tallaza scowled at Tetes
muttering. He scowled more fiercely
at the shark which came nosing round
the hook and carried away his bait. He
was experimenting with the oysters that
grow on trees. Of that in sequel.
	Tete laughed. Antonio Tallaza turned
upon him with rage. He raised a piece
of the filling of the wharf. Tete jumped
to his feet. He seized the stone from
Antonio Tallaza, and threw it with a
great splash at the shark.
	Thou fish of the devil! said he,
beating the American captain over the
shoulders of the shark, thou swimmer
from hell! stealing the morsel which is
dangling to tempt thy Christian bro-
ther!
	You will hand to me that branch of
oysters, Tete.
	Tete lifted the branch which was hang-
ing full with shells. At that moment the
steamers whistle sounded. He dropped
the mass of bait into the water. The
shark opened his jaws. The dainty dis-
appeared.
	Ah! that thou wert there, also!
ejaculated Antonio Tallaza, as he saw
the great jaws close.
	So the loading was over. The steam-
er would be starting in a moment. No
one had ever got ahead of the American
captain. No, no, not even in this land
where getting ahead was meat and drink.
Tete stood stolid, deaf even to the revil-
ings of Antonio Tallaza. What was it
to him that Antonio Tallaza must walk
up the long, hot wharf; that he must
plunge into the mud left by the falling
tide, to pluck from the roots of the man-</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00705" SEQ="0705" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="699">	The Alecddes Visit.	699

grove the bivalve - ridden stems? He,
Tete, had other worlds to conquer.
	Thou wilt lose thy boat! That please
me very well, growled Antonio Tallaza,
as he plodded up the track.
	I know my business best, Antonio
Tallaza; you may employ yourself in at-
tending to your shark.
	The fruit steamer had been warped
round from the end of the wharf to avoid
Palm Tree Island.
	Let go your lines! shouted the
American captain from his station on
the upper deck.
	The gangplank was removed. The
propeller turned over once, twice. Tete
ran lightly along the stringpiece. The
steamer was well away from the wharf,
and getting farther away every second.
Could he do it? If he did not, there
was no small boat to save him, and there
were the sharks. Ones heart stood still.
It was a phenomenal leap. The slight
body flew swift and straight as a die. It
landed on the lower deck, just escaping
the rail.
	The American captain saw it with the
tails of the eyes which were avoiding
Palm Tree Island on the one side, and
the coral reef on the other. This was
no time for discipline. Later he would
see to that. But later he remembered
nothing save the pluck and the courage.
	I have a great mind to put back to
the wharf, you young devil, smiled the
American captain.
	I would be glad to save you that
trouble, Sefio Capitan, said Tete very
politely.
	The sefiora had tried to teach Tete
that polite words are never wasted. For-
tunately, he sometimes remembered this.
	Arrived at Saltona, twelve miles across
the great bay as the crow flies, Tete skir-
mished. Juan Ruiz, who kept the cock-
pit outside the town, wondered what lit-
tle Tete Dessange was doing so far from
home. And has the little Tete brought
his cock to fight at my Gallera to-night?
he asked.
	I have not brought my cock, Juan
Ruiz. It is the truth, no doubt, that my
fine young cock could tear the brains from
every cock in Saltona. Then I should
take thy dollars back to the Cattle Farm
with me, Juan Ruiz. But I am here on
much more important businesses than
that fighting of the cock.
	Juan shrugged his shoulders and turned
on his horny heel. He knew only too
well the reputation of Tetes black one-
eyed cock.
	Then Tete addressed a gentleman who
was lounging slowly down the baking,
uneven street. The stranger was a fine-
looking man, though his skin was darker
than Tetes own. His starched white
suit, fresh pink shirt, and fine Panama
hat proclaimed him a personage of some
importance. He raised his cigarette to
his lips and puffed lazily. Probably, if
Tete could have read his thoughts, he
would have found that the gentleman
was saying to himself over and over,
The English company must be squeezed
a little more,  just a little more! They
can stand it. They could not leave now!
It would be fatal to them. They have
invested so much in 
You wish to speak to me, mucha-
cho? for Tete had touched his crown-
less hat. As he did so, he noticed the
large seal ring on the slim dark hand that
held the cigarette.
	Will the seiio be so good direct me
to the Seiio Alcalde?
	What should you want with the Al-
calde, boy? The tone was pleasant
enough.
	I have some messages for the Seilo
Alcalde, seilo.
	The stranger held out his hand. Then
Tete formed his plans, and soliloquized
thus: Betta retain those messages in
my bosom. That will serve Misser Wil-
liams the best. The man that is on the
spot know the most than the other man
which is not there.
	A letter? You can give it to me.
I am the Alc~lde</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00706" SEQ="0706" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="700">	700	The Alcaldes Visit.

	Tete pulled the straw brim from off
the wisps of black hair which stuck up
like burned branches. He bowed po-
litely, and looked about to left, to right,
assuming an air of great secrecy and im-
portance.
	I convey a message to the Seiio
Alcalde, it is true, but no written mes-
sage. How limp and wet the man-
agers letter to the Alcalde felt against
his warm little body! The message
is from the Don Felipe Rodriguez, the
father of my Seiioit Carlota. The
Don Felipe ask the Seflo Alcalde to pre-
sent himself at the Cattle Farm on Thurs-
day and dine.
	The Alcaldes cunning eyes shot forth
a gleam of joy. He raised his slim fin-
gers and stroked his drooping mustache
to hide an exultant smile. Then it might
not be true about the Don Hilariol Else
the Don Felipe would never send for
him.
	On what day, muchacho? Thurs-
day?
	Si, Seiio Alcalde.
	Tete watched every movement of the
Alcalde. He noted the well - starched
cuffs and the gleam of the handsome
sleeve-links.
	The Alcalde pondered for a moment.
He desired to accept, above all things.
What was in the way to prevent? Only
that he might meet some one whom he
did not care just now to see.
	Where is the American managero,
muchacho? At Las Lilas?
	No, Sego Alcalde. Misser Wil-
liams has return to the es-States. He
go in steamer Esperanza, who sail to-
day.
	Ah! North again! He must be
fond of that North. For me, I like not
that North. Here I am great man, gen-
tleman. There I am  Well, well! say
to the sefiorita  ahem!  the Sefior
Don Felipe  that I will come with great
pleasure. Thursday,  why, that is the
day after to-morrow, boy!
	And to bring a small hair trunk,
and remain days without number, seilo.
Tetes experience had been with visitors
from the States.
	The Alcalde raised his hand to his
mouth again. His joy was as broad as
his smile. She must have rejected Don
Hilario, then!
	Where is the Seilora Sagas Wil-
liams, muchacho? The Alcalde was a
wise man; he wished to be sure of his
ground.
	She accompany the Misser Williams.
Also the old seiiora, the Seiiora Cordeza;
also the peons, John Francios and Car-
rate; also the maid Fanache; also 
Tete had lost his wits in the mazes of
invention.
	I care not about the plans of the
Seiior Managero. How shall I get
from the wharf to the Cattle Farm?
~y horse is afraid of the fin-keel. No
steamer for some days yet.
	The seiioit  I would say, then, the
Seflo Don Felipe  will have a horse
at the wharf, the companys wharf. And
now I return, Sefto Alcalde.
	The Alcalde mused, smiling. The
boys slips are certainly reassuring. She
has undoubtedly sent for me. Of that
I am certain. And then aloud, You
shall take my boat, muchacho. They
were walking toward the quay. There
is a fine fresh breeze. Here, Garcia, take
the muchacho across to the companys
wharf. Return at once. I shall need the
boat on Thursday. She must be paint-
ed. Fine visions flew through the brain
of the Alcalde of a magic name on the
stern, and a moonlight sail on the waters
of the bay with one  And to bring
a little hair trunk, Seiio Alcalde.
	I shall arrive on the Thursday, mu-
chacho.
	And I will myself meet the Seiio
Alcalde when he shall arrive.
	Tetes airs of importance rivaled
those of an ambassador who had come
on a mission for the arrangement of a
royal wedding.
	As Tete started on his return trip his</PB>

pout was gone. A smile illumined his
lips. His eye had grown soft and gen-
tle as a fawns.
	Tete stood at the mast, his arm clasp-
ing it, to insure safety, his straight black
hair blowing in the wild, sweet breeze.
	And why should I not do those for
my Misser Williams, who make a travel
person of me? And if in the es-States
I carry the seiiora shawl, can I do less
for those who are kind in their hearts to
me? And if I do use my Seiioit Car-
lota name, will she not laugh and show
her white teeth when I reveal to her all
this fine plan which I make?
	Tete felt in the bosom of his shirt,
and drew therefrom a letter addressed
in Misser Williamss round, straightfor-
ward hand. The outer covering was
stained by the fine red string which was
tied round the packet, but Tete knew that
the inner paper was intact.
	To be sure it is soak of my sweat,
said Tete, but it dry in the trade wind.
If I deliver this letter, would not those
sleeve-link get hid? And am I wrong
in supposing that the round, fiat thing
on some one s es-stomack, I have seen,
oh! many times before? I should like
to put my ear to that es-stomack. It is
the firs time a es-stomack shall tick!
I shall return the letter to iMlisser Wil-
liams when the time come, and I must
inform Misser Williams that my way
better than hees way. One must put
salt on the tails of such a bird.
	On the following Thursday the Al-
calde of Saltona set sail for Caijo San-
dros in his fine fin-keel boat. He had
changed its name from La Paloma
to La Carlota. The paint was scarce-
ly dry. The waves lap-lapping at the
stern washed it away little by little. It
was as well that the Alcalde did not
know this; he was, in a measure, super-
stitious. The boat had a holiday ap-
pearance, and the Alcalde, in his green-
striped suit, and his lilac shirt with pink
dots, set off with an orange-colored tie,
looked the embodiment of happy hopes.
	True to his promise, Tete was in wait-
ing at the companys wharf. He be-
strode a large brown bull, and held the
rein of a fine gray stallion.
	That horse looks very much like the
one that belonged to old Sagasta,  the
one that the American managero rides
now, thought the Alcalde.
	There was no train at the wharf. The
fruit ready for the market had all been
cut for the week and sent North. The
hair trunk, which had been brought by
the Alcalde at Tetes suggestion, was
hoisted out of the boat and dumped upon
the wharf.
	The fine hair trunk of the Sefio
Alcalde will be sent for by train, said
Tete. The agent has give the order.
Tetes imagination had no limit. It was
boundless as the ocean upon which he
gazed.
	The strangely assorted pair struck
back into the interior. The Alcalde led
upon the gray, which he thought had
been sent for him by the order of Don
Felipe,  the gray which had in real-
ity belonged to the Seiior Sagasta, and
which Misser Williams, ignorant and
trusting, believed to be resting in the
stall as cure for a slight sprain.
	Tete followed the Alcalde, upon the
big brown bull, which Misser Williams,
grown a little lazier now, and less in-
quisitive, thought far away over the hills,
carrying suckers to the newly cleared
land.
	The Alcalde rode with the ease and
assurance of the accomplished horse-
man. Tete rode with the same ease and
assurance, though with less grace. His
short legs stood Qut straight from the
sides of the aparejo upon which he sat.
Sometimes he varied the monotony of
his journey by standing upright on his
fiat pack saddle, and with the crooked
stick that he carried he goaded the bull
into a run. This annoyed the gray, who
jumped and caracoled unpleasantly, at
which Tete chuekled silently. When
the Alcalde remonstrated in rather vio</PB>

lent language, Tete, ever polite where
interest demanded, answered, It is this
devil of a bull that run, seilo. He wish
to gore the horse. I should not be sur-
prise if he gore the horse before we ar-
rive at the Cattle Farm. On account
of such remarks the Alcalde did not ride
with his accustomed pleasure.
	As the pair neared the outskirts of
the home inclosure of Las Lilas, a horse-
man came riding swiftly down toward
them. It was Misser Williams astride
the little roan. When the Alcalde saw
that it was the America:i manager, he
made as if to turn the gray short in his
tracks. The path was narrow, and Tete,
who had also caught sight of the mana-
ger, strange to say, had placed the bull
across it. He was standing up on the
saddle to pick some lilies that drooped
from an overhanging vine.
	The rage that consumed the Alcalde
turned his face to a dull ash color. He
saw at once that the boy had duped him;
for what cause he could not determine.
That the American manager was here
at Las Lilas instead of steaming North-
ward in the Esperanza made him feel
anything but comfortable. A quick back-
ward glance over his shoulder showed
him a narrow path, with a steep precipice
on one side, on the other a high wall of
ragged rock, and across the path the
heavy body of the big brown bull. There
was nothing for it but to go on. The
Alcalde gave the spur to the gray and
faced Misser Williams.
	Ah, sefior, a pleasant surprise!
said Misser Williams.
	The Alcalde raised his fine large Pana-
ma and made the American a sweeping
bow. Seiior, he said, this imp of
the devil has had the assurance to tell
me that you and the sefiora had gone
again into the North. I am pleased to
find that the Sefior Superintendente is
still among ~
	The gray! gasped the manager,
as he eyed the stallion. You are wel-
come to all that I have, Sefior Alcalde:
my house is yours, my servants are
yours.~~
	The Alcalde interrupted the manager:
Pardon, Sefior Managero, but I should
like to own that devils spawn   he
pointed backward at Tete  for the
space of a half hour.
	Tete belongs at the Cattle Farm,
said the manager, smiling, though he is
as much here as there. But the gray,
sefior  I cannot understand  he has
been laid up with a sprain.
	Misser Williams looked searchingly
at Tete, who stood on his saddle pluck-
ing great yellow tubes. Then the Al-
calde wheeled the stallion, and together
they regarded the boy. Apparently,
both gentlemen were beginning to real-
ize that some one had been taking lib-
erties. As the gaze of two pairs of eyes
brought no response from Tete, the
American signed to the Alcalde to pre-
cede him.
	After you, Alcalde.
	The Alcalde, seeing that there was
no possibility of passing by Tete and the
bull, resigned himself to the inevitable.
	Why did you tell the Sefior Alcalde
that I had gone, Tete? called back
Misser Williams.
	Because I wished the Alcalde to be-
lieve it, seflo.
	Misser Williams raised his shoulders
with a careless shrug. You see, Sefior
Alcalde. They never have a reason for
what they do; they are hopeless liars.
	Suddenly the Alcaldes saddle slipped.
He put his slim hand quickly behind
him and clutched the crupper to right
it. This action shortened his coat-sleeve.
There was a flash from his wrist. Misser
Williams started.
	This is the path to Las Lilas, Sefior
Alcalde. You will go home with me
and dine. The tone sounded more like
a command than the manager intended
that it should.
	I should be most happy, sefior, but
I am promised at the Cattle Farm of the
Sefior Felipe.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00709" SEQ="0709" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="703">	!Iike Alcaldes Visit.	703

	Not to-night, surely, seflor. They
are all away at Haldez. They have gone
on some very particular business. I am
going to join them this evening. Come
home and dine with me, and we can ride
over together when the sun goes down.
They will be delighted to welcome you.
	The Alcalde bad no intention of spend-
ing more time in the managers compa-
ny than was necessary. He was con-
sumed with rage, but he was also con-
sumed with hunger. The fame of the
cook at Las Lilas had reached even far-
ther than Saltona. He leaned out of his
saddle and glowered back at the toes of
Tete, who was seated sidewise. His bull
plodded with wide strides slowly after
the horses. The Alcalde thought, What
excuse can I give for wanting to turn
and rush down to the coast again in this
devils sun? Aloud he said, That
young liar! He brought me a message
from Don Felipe.
	And not one from me? asked Mis-
ser Williams.
	The manager was regarding Tete.
The boy shook his head violently and
waved the letter in the sun. Then he
stood up on his saddle.
	You are right, Segor Alcalde, said
he, smiling. I have my motives.
	Imp of the devil! I shall ask you
to send that boy to the cep to-morrow,
Seiior Managero.
	The manager was thinking deeply.
If Tete has done wrong, he shall cer-
tainly be punished, Seiior Alcalde. For
the borrowing of the stallion and the
brown bull Tete might need disciplina-
ry measures. Misser Williams looked
serious. But you will not refuse my
invitation, seiior? I am alone, with the
exception of the Sefiora Cordeza.
	The Alcaldes inner man was gnaw-
ing, and, all things considered, he could
do nothing but accept.
	And now they had reached the veran-
da steps. The gentlemen alighted. The
horses were led away, the bull trotted
after, and all were tethered so securely
by Tete that no slight effort would re-
lease them.
	Lola, show the Seiior Alcalde to the
green chamber, and bring pure water
and some fresh clothes.
	The blue room is nearer, said Lola,
argumentative like her race.
	Take the Sefior Alcalde to the green
room, Lola. The entire order was re-
peated.
	Lola retreated sulkily. The Alcalde
followed in her wake. The woman went
for water. The Alcalde tried to close
his door. It had swollen and would not
close, as all the household knew. For
doors grow, as every one must know who
has built a house.
	Misser Williams was not long behind
his guest. He hovered over him; he
made it a point of hospitality to see with
his own eyes that fresh water and cool
linen were brought to the chamber. He
sat just outside the door, where he could
watch his every movement, and talked
with his guest.
	The Alcalde was constrained, and did
his dressing in a very awkward manner.
Sometimes he turned his back on the
manager; without ostentation, however.
	When Tete went to the stables, Cito
Mores was lounging against one of the
posts. Bully, Leon, and two ragged
grooms were each busily engaged in
lounging against his own particular post,
each one chewing his own particular
straw.
	Why did you bring the Alcalde to
Las Lilas, boy? asked Cito Mores.
	That is my business, Cito Mores. I
must look after Misser Williams, since
there is no one else to look after him.
Perhaps, Leon, and you, Bully, it would
be a good thing to attend to the roan
and the gray, and not eat up all of the
straw that they may have no beds.
	But the Alcalde, persisted Cito
Mores. Why did he come?
	He knows no more than you your-
self, Cito Mores. Do you think that he
would have come if I tell to him the</PB>

reasons? If you will take the advice
from one which has travel and which
know the world, you will draw near the
casa; the Seiior Managero may require
you presence.
	Misser Williams and his guest sat upon
the broad veranda, beneath the shade of
a bougainvillea vine. Lola brought out
a tray with cigarillos and some flue old
rum. She took tiae yellow water jar
from its short branch upon the natural
pilotijo. She placed it, dripping with
moisture, upon the table. It made a
wet, cold ring. Old Marta must have
the time to concoct a special dish for so
distinguished a guest as the Alcalde.
Juan must bring mangoes from the large
tree down by the river. He must also
bring aguacate pears of the finest from
the pasture patch, though they were not
well ripe as yet.
	The Alcalde sat with his green.striped
coat buttoned tightly across his breast,
his arms squarely folded. The heat was
excessive; the breeze had died away.
	Open your coat, Seiior Alcalde, I beg
of you. It is a hot day, even at Las Li-
las. Let me hand you a fan. Misser
Williams took a palm leaf from the rack
behind his head.
	The Alcalde sat like a statue. He
bowed stiffly.
	I thank you, Sei~ior Superintendente.
I find it cool enough.
	Silent contradictors in the shape of
round beads of moisture stood upon the
Alcaldes brow. He felt sick and faint.
It was a long, hot ride to the coast, but
if the stallion had stood at the steps, the
Alcalde would have made a vault and
spurred for distance and for honor. He
wondered feebly how all this was to end.
He took up his glass in an embarrassed
manner. He allowed the manager to
pour out his drink for him. He thanked
him, with a constrained bow.
	Spicy odors were wafted appetizingly
round the corner of the casa. One could
hear old Marta, with Pedro to hinder,
clattering her dishes and discoursing on
different methods of flavoring. The Al-
calde might have had the strength of
mind to take his departure, but had he
the strength of stomach? His inner man
almost spoke aloud.
	A light for your cigarillo, Seiior
Alcalde.
	Lola was standing near, smiling and
bare of foot, her dress starched and full
of holes. She held a tray with a silver
dragon all aflame. A broken saucer for
ashes was in this proud company.
	A stiff bow from the Alcalde; stiffer
acknowledgment in the words, My
thanks to you, Sefior Managero. I have
given up the practice  my heart  
The Alcalde pressed his hand upon the
place where that member beat with rage,
disappointment, and chagrin. Under-
neath that hand was a round, fiat object,
of somewhat different shape and size
from the organ named.
	Misser Williams puffed silently. He
was musing upon the fact of having
come upon the Alcalde just as he tossed
away a cigar, very long and very black.
Few persons lie gratuitously. There
must always be a motive for premedi-
tated sin; unless, like the French, one
pursues the habit to keep his hand in.
What could be the Alcaldes motive?
	The Alcalde grew fixed, rigid; he
clasped his hands over the vacuum with-
in him.
	At the suggestion of Tete, Cito Mores,
with the grooms, had come round from
the stables. The three had seated them-
selves upon the lowest of the veranda
steps. Tete had been exercising his legs
by balancing himself upon the veranda
rail, his motions like those of Dondy-
Jeem, a tight-rope walker whom he had
once seen over at Haldez. He, however,
kept a close watch upon the Alcalde. At
times he withdrew his gaze to fix a pity-
ing glance upon Misser Williams, as if
to say, Poor innocent! So ignorant
of the world! It is I, Tete, which must
employ myself in serving those interest
of yours.</PB>

	The dinner is served, Sefior Mana-
gero.
	It was Lola who spoke, trying to fas-
ten together the edges of a hole in her
waist, where the starch would not allow
the pin to enter.
	The manager arose. He bowed to
the Alcalde and signed to him to lead
the way.
	They entered the dining-room. The
Seiiora Cordeza entered at the same
moment from another door. Wrinkled
and yellow, her mantilla thrown over
the high comb that she wore, she stepped
lightly toward the table. She bowed to
the Alcalde with a certain dignity com-
bined with a languid grace, which re-
minded one, in spite of himself, of moon-
lit verandas and odorous breezes of the
night. Her eyes, once the pride and
toast of all the estates round about Las
Lilas, were still large and dark, and
they sent a challenge to the Alcalde as
they were raised to his. Now was her
harvest. The young sefiora was away.
For when does a daughter of the sunny
South realize that she has long passed
by the milestone where the word at-
tractiveness  is  writ large 
	That glance of the Sefiora Cordeza
met with no response. The Alcalde felt
that he was meat for her masters. He
had matters of more importance to dis-
tract him than the mere smiles of wo-
man. Unlike the luminous orbs of the
Sefiora Cordeza, his small eyes were set
far back in his head and close to his
aquiline nose. His movements were
embarrassed. Each awkward gesture
seemed to confess, I am in a devil of a
box; how am Ito get out of it?
	A little of the san-coche, Seiior Al-
calde?
	The half-famished man was minded
to reply, I am not hungry, I have no
appetite. But St. Anthony himself
could not have withstood the spicy odors
of that seductive dish, although he might
have withstood the charms of the Se-
flora Cordeza. The Alcalde pulled the
	VOL. LXXXII.  No. 493.	45
sleeves of his green-striped coat down,
down over his knuckles; he grasped his
spoon; he began to eat with ungraceful
motions.
	The san-coche was delicious. A feast
for the gods! Who could be prudent?
In a twinkling the soup-plate was bare.
He would enjoy yet another dish of this
delightful stew. Custom makes us un-
mindful. To compass our desires pru-
dence is thrown to the winds; we grow
careless to the point of discovery, from
the habitual coquette to the chronic em-
bezzler of other mens money. With
one hand the Alcalde pushed back the
long, drooping mustache; with the other
he raised the spoon hurriedly to his lips.
The green-striped sleeve slipped upward
toward the elbow. Misser Williamss
eyes grew round and large; they were
glued to the objects before him. The
Alcalde laid his spoon down with a sigh
of contentment, to find the managers
gaze fixed upon his cuffs.
	Those sleeve-links remind me very
much of some that I lost on the steamer,
Sefior Alcalde,  those of which I wrote
you. The managers tone had never
been more polite.
	The Alcaldes eyes dropped. He start-
ed hurriedly to pull his sleeves over his
cuffs, but at once thought better of it.
	These sleeve-links? Sefior Mana-
gero  Ah! How could I forget my
errand! Will my dear Sefior Managero
pardon me? I put them in my cuffs
this morning, that I might bring them
to the Sefior Managero myself.
	How more than kind, Seflor Al-
calde! The manager rivaled the Al-
calde in bows and smiles. Do not re-
move them, I beg. They are yours.
	The Alcalde, having appreciated from
the time that he could speak the amount
of truth that lies in this generous declara-
tion, slowly removed the links from his
cuffs.
	Allow me, he said, and placed the
links in the managers politely reluctant
hand. No defeated general on the field</PB>

of battle ever surrendered his sword with
a greater degree of grace. They were
discovered upon the wretched peon who
stole them from the managero. I have
him safe in the cep at Saltona. His
feet are in the stocks. The Alcalde
concealed the fact that he should be
more than glad to see the Seftor Mana-
gero in the same predicament. He
awaits the Sefior Manageros disposition.
Shall it be the army, or shall he be shot
at once, as he deserves ?
	You may put him in the army, Sefior
Alcalde. Misser Williams smifed sweet-
ly. They prefer death, I believe.
	Tete had followed Lola into the room
with some peppers.
	The Sefior Alcalde has a very fine
watch, hazarded Tete. (He stood gaz-
ing at the Alcalde as if he would say,
	Who is deserving of the cep now?)
I saw it open wide when lie leave the
fin-keel.
	 Ah!  Misser Williamss tone was
one of pleased discovery.
	Cito Mores and the grooms had
lounged near the doorless opening of the
dining-room. All eyes were fixed upon
the Aicalde.
	Your fine dishes make me forget my
errand. The Alcalde slid those long,
brown fingers into his waistcoat pocket.
I started with the purpose of bringing
the Sefior Managero all of his belong-
ings. Is it then certain, seiior, that this
fine watch belongs to you?
	The familiar timepiece was laid in
Misser Williamss hand. It was a pre-
sent from my wife; one that belonged
to the Seiior Sagasta, he said simply.
He pressed the spring. The cover flew
back. We say in the North, the
blessed, honest North,  Misser Wil-
liams spoke with emphasis, He who
runs may read.
That depend on which ways he will
run at that time, Misser Williams. Now,
if the Sefior Alcalde run to the coast 
Be quiet, Tete! The reproachful
tone was sugared with a smile. The
manager handed the watch back to the
Alcalde.
	The Alcalde put the dear temptation
from him with a sigh. I do not read
the English, Sefior Managero.
	That is a mistake, sefior. It is well
to know all languages. It often pre-
vents misunderstandings.
	Misser Williams turned the inside of
the cover to all the light that the jalou-
sies allowed to enter, and read, Pre-
sented to John fiLho as 147illiams by his
loving w~fr, Suzon. Bless her!  lie
added.
	Every one in the island knows that
watch, high as well as low. It is not
difficult to find the owner of such a
watch. The Sefior Sagasta bought it on
the last visit he made to Spain.
	It was the Sefiora Cordeza who spoke,
in the purest Spanish. One should be cau-
tious how one undervalues the charms
even of a Sefiora Cordeza.
	It is useful to know all languages,
repeated the American manager. I
suffer from much the same trouble with
the Spanish. Not quite the same, either.
Misser Williams smiled broadly. And
 and  there was  the Sefior Alcalde
will pardon me  a long note-case  did
diddidyou
The Alcalde glanced toward the open-
ing. Cito Mores and the grooms, with
the freedom of the trusted servants of
that indolent land, were leaning against
the veranda posts. They were resolute-
looking men. Their faces showed a
watchful interest. The Alcalde remem-
bered with joy the changing of some
large bills from his pocket to his safe,
that very morning,  bills for which the
American captain would gladly exchange
his silver dollars.
	He put his hand into his breast pocket
and drew forth a case. Is this the one,
perhaps, Sefior Superintendente?
	The manager took the case eagerly,
and opened the leathern flap. He looked
up blankly. If one could have analyzed
the expression on the Alcaldes face. one</PB>

would have said that it was a look of
concealed triumph.
	I suppose there was no money in it,
when it was recovered, seiior?
	Not a peso, Sefior Managero.
	Misser Williams proceeded to search
the interior of the note-case with the fa-
miliarity which old acquaintance gives.
He took from it a gold-bearing draft.
	Mama Cordezas inquisitive eye caught
the number 1000.
	Let us be thankful for small favors,
Alcalde. This draft would be of no use
to any one else.
	Of not the very slightest use, Seiior
Managero.
	The Alcalde spoke with a settled con-
viction. He ground his teeth together.
Regardless of the Seiiora Cordezas pre-
sence, he raised his clenched hands and
shook them in air. The linkless sleeves
flapped against the dark wrists.
	Ah! But that thief! Ah But
that jail bird! I will have him shot!
I will have him to remain in the cep
until his feet rot from his ankles! He
shall never walk again! A-a-a-a-ak!
Any death is much too good for a thief!
And that he should have stolen from my
good friend the managero! He shall
be taken to-morrow outside the town!
He shall be stood against the wall! He
shall be sent to hell, where he belongs!
	Misser Williams was slowly removing
the ivory studs which had done duty for
the links, and replacing them with his
recovered treasures. The Alcalde ad-
dressed himself again to the savory stew.
	How can I thank you, my dear Seiior
Alcalde? I have my buttons just in time
to wear them to the wedding of the
Sefiorita Carlota. She marries the Don
Hilario at Haldez to-morrow morning.
The Alcalde dropped his spoon with
a tremendous splash.
	And they will tell you in the States
that there is no honesty in the Span-
iard! said Misser Williams in a mus-
ing tone.
	Thus one sees how unjustly we are
represented the world over, added the
Alcalde in an almost even voice.
	Let us continue our dinner, re-
joined the manager. The san-coche
will be cold, and we shall not get to the
wedding.

SOME ASPECTS OF THACKERAY.

I.

	TWENTY years ago, at Harvard Col-
lege, in the rooms of all students of
certain social pretensions who affected
books, you were sure to see on the most
conspicuous shelf, in green and gold or
in half calf, the works of William Make-
peace Thackeray. The name, boldly
printed, greeted you as you entered the
door, and served, together with sundry
red - sealed certificates and beribboned
silver medals, to inform you of the gen-
eral respectability and gentility of your
host. Of a Sunday morning, this stu
dent was likely to be discovered compla-
cent over the Book of Snobs or serious
over Vanity Fair.
	Public opinion went that Thackeray
was the novelist of gentlemen and for
gentlemen; that Dickehs was undoubted-
ly strong, but he had not had the privi-
lege of knowing and of delineating the
things which were adapted to interest
the most select of Harvard undergradu-
ates. In every fold there are some to
lower the general standard of critical
excellence; there were some partisans
of Dickens. They were judged, as mi-
norities are, found guilty of running coun</PB>

ter to accepted opinions, and outlawed
from further literary criticism.
	These Harvard critics did not make
for themselves this opinion of Thackeray;
they brought it with them from home.
	We suppose that parents, what time
their son started in the world on the first
path which diverged from theirs, deemed
that they were equipping him with the
best master to teach him concerning the
ways of that world. Theirs was the old
lack of faith, so common to the fearful;
they sought to guard their son from the
world by pointing out to him its vanity,
its folly, its emptiness.  Oh, if he shall
only know what the world is, they
thought. he will escape its evils to
come. So they gave him Thackeray,
and wrote him long letters on idleness
and vice. His bookshelves and his in-
ner pockets thus encumbered, the youth
found Harvard College a miniature of
the world of which he had been warned.
There were materials enough for such a
conclusion. A seeker will find what he
goes forth to seek. The youth learned
his Thackeray well, spent four years en-
joying his little Vanity Fair, and then
departed from Cambridge to help build
up the larger world of Vanity which
shows so fine in America to-day.
	There is no phenomenon so interest-
ing as the unconscious labor of boys and
men over tbe task of shaping, hewing,
whittling, and moulding the world into
accord with their anticipations. All lend
helping hands to the great master im-
plement, public expectation. A young
fellow goes to college, and joins a group
of a dozen others. Brown, the rake,
thinks, Here s a Lothario who will sup
at Dame Quicklys with me; Smith,
the boxer, says, A quick eye,  I 11
make a boxer of him; Jones, who
translates Homer for the group, sees
rhythm and Theocritus in the new-
comer s curly hair; Robinson, the phi-
losopher, feels a fellow Hegelian. These
rival expectations leap out to meet the
stranger ~ they struggle among them-
selves. Of the students, some agree
with Brown, some with Smith, others
with Robinson or Jones. The sturdiest
of these expectations chokes out the oth-
ers and survives. After a short time
 our young fellow yet entirely undis-
covered  a strong current of unani-
mous expectation has decided that he
shall be a boxer. All obstacles to the
execution of this judgment are taken
away, and moral earthworks are quickly
thrown up, guarding him from Brown,
Jones, and Robinson. Expectation seats
him beside Smith; expectation turns the
conversation upon champions of the
ring; expectation draws the gloves upon
his fists; it offers him no Eastcheap, no
Theocritus, no Hegel. The youth takes
boxing lessons; soon he learns the lan-
guage of the fraternity; he walks, runs,
avoids mince pies, eschews books, and
with a single eye looks forward to a
bout in Hemenway Gymnasium. Thus
the tricksy spirit expectation shapes the
destinies of common humankind. Thus
do parents begin to expect that their son
will see the world with their own and
Thackerays beam-troubled eyes; they
insist that he shall, and in due time he
does.
	Once convince a young man that
Thackerays world is the real world,
that vulgarity, meanness, trickery, and
fraud abound, and you put him in a
yoke from which he shall never free him-
self. This is the yoke of base expecta-
tion. This is what is known in Scrip-
ture as the world; it is the habit
of screwing up the eyes and squinting
in order to see unworthiness, baseness,
vice, and wickedness; it is a creeping
blindness to nobler things. The weapon
against the world is, as of old, to use a
word of great associations, faith. Faith
is nothing but noble expectation, and all
education should be to supplant base ex-
pectation by noble expectation. What
is the human world in which we live but
a mighty mass of sensitive matter, high-
ly susceptible to the great force of hu</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00715" SEQ="0715" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="709">Some Aspects of Thackeray.

man expectation, which flows about it
like an ever shifting Gulf Stream, now
warming and prospering noble people,
and then wantonly comforting the un-
worthy?
	Feeble folk that we are, we have in
this power of creation an element of di-
vinity in us. Our expectations hover
about like life-giving agencies. We are
conscious that our hopes and our fears
are at work all the time helping the on-
coming of that which we hope or fear.
The future is like a newborn babe stretch-
ing out its arms to the stronger. It may
be that this power in us is weak, intermit-
ten.t, often pitiably feeble; but now and
again comes a man with a larger mea-
sure of divine life, and his great expec-
tations pass into deeds. Before every
Trafalgar first comes an expectation that
duty will be done.
	Thackeray has no faith; he does not
entertain high expectations. His char-
acters do shameless things, and Thack-
eray says to the reader, Be not sur-
prise(l, injured - seeming friend; you
would have done the like under the like
temptation. At first you contradict,
you resent; but little by little Thacke-
rays opinion of you inoculates you; the
virus takes; you lose your conviction
that you would have acted differently;
you concede that such conduct was not
impossible, even for you,  no, nor im-
probable,  and, on the whole, after re-
flection, that the conduct was excusable,
was good enough, was justified, was in-
evitable, was right, was scrupulously
right, and only a Don Quixote would
have acted otherwise.
	Nothing sickens and dies so quickly
as noble expectation. Luxury, comfort,
custom, the ennui of hourly exertion,
the dint of disappointment, assail it un-
ceasingly if a man of ten talents, like
Thackeray, joins the assailants, is it not
just that admiration of him should be
confined to those who are willing to ad-
mire talents, irrespective of the use to
which they are put?
II.

	England has found it hard to bring
forth men of faith. In the great days
of Queen Elizabeth, a number of uniting
causes produced an emotional excitement
which lifted Englishmen and English-
wonien to such a height that Shakespeare
saw Othello, Hamlet, Brutus, Coriola-
nus, Miranda, Cordelia. There was
the material stimulus of commerce with
strange countries, the prick of money;
there was this curious earth, inviting
wooers; there was the goad of con-
science, troubled to renounce the religion
of old; there was the danger of foreign
conquerors; there was manly devotion
to a Virgin Queen. England roused her-
self, and, like a dew-drop from the lions
mane, shook off the trammels of petty
interests, of vulgar self-seeking, and pre-
sented to her poet great sights of human
nobility. Not that the moral elevation
of a nation is very much higher at one
time than at another, but a little swell-
ing of noble desires so breaks the ice of
custom that a poet must see the clearer
waters which lie beneath. If Shake-
speare were alive to-day, we doubt not
that he would tell of new Othellos, new
Cordelias; but it was easier for him
then than it would be now, or how could
such a host of noble men and women
people his pages?
	Since that time England has been pro-
sperous and comfortable; and as her
comfort and prosperity have increased
she has drifted further and further from
a great acceptance of the world. Dry-
den and his group, Fielding, Sheridan,
men of talents in their different genera-
tions, have succeeded, who contemplate
themselves, and, expecting to find the
world a fit place for them to live in,
have helped to render it so.
	A hundred years ago England shook
herself free from the dominion of vulgar
men. In France, the triple burden of
church, monarch, and nobility, the prohi-
bition of thought. the injustice of power,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00716" SEQ="0716" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="710">	710	Some Aspects of Thackeray.
had lain like millstones on the people;
each individual had borne his own bur-
den, but one after another each saw that
not he alone groaned and sweated, but
his brothers also. The fardel a man
can bear by himself he can no longer
carry when he sees an endless line of
other men weighted down and stagger-
ing. Sight of injustice to others made
each individual in France throw off his
own yoke; and the most exultant cry
of justice, of brotherly love, ever heard,
was raised. No country lives alone.
French passion flushed to England. Eng-
lishmen were roused some were for lib-
erty; others saw their dull old homes
and habits transfigured in the blaze of
new ideas. Noble Republicans bred no-
ble Tories. Everything was ennobled;
babies looked more beautiful to their
mothers; Virgil interested schoolboys;
ragamuffins and ploughboys felt strange
disquiet as they heard the words liber-
ty, country, brotherhood, home:
This shock and counter-shock prepared
the way for the great poets of that time,
and made Walter Scott possible. Scott
had faith; he saw a noble world. But
the idealism of France passed away, its
glow faded from the English cliffs; dan-
~ger was locked up in St. Helena, and
prosperity and comfort, like Gog and
Magog, stalked through England.
	Thackeray was bred when Englishmen
were forsaking swords for ledgers,
and deserting the students bower for
gold. His father died when he was
very young. His mother married for her
second husband an Indian officer, and
Thackeray was sent to school in Eng-
land.
	In a new biographical edition of
Thackerays works which Messrs. Har-
per &#38; Brothers are publishing, Mrs.
Ritchie has written brief memories of
her father at the beginning of each vol-
ume, with special relation to its contents.
These memories are done with filial af-
fection. Thackerays kindness, his ten-
derness. his sympathetic nature, are writ-
ten large on every page. He has many
virtues. He dislikes vice, drunkenness,
betrayal of women, pettifogging, huck-
stering, lying, cheating, knavery, the an-
noyance and tomfoolery of social distinc-
tions. He would like to leave the world
better than he found it, but he cannot
see. Pettiness, the vulgarity of money,
the admiration of mean things, hang be-
fore him like a curtain at the theatre.
Romeo may be on fire, Hotspur leap for
the moon, Othello stab Jago, Lear die
in Cordelias lap; but the sixteenth of
an inch of frieze and fustian keeps it all
from him.
	At nineteen Thackeray spent a win-
ter at Weimar. He soon writes to his
mother of Goethe as the great lion of
Weimar. He is not eager to possess
the great measures of life. He is not
sensitive to Goethe, but to the court of
Pumpernickel. He wishes he were a
cornet in Sir John Kennaways yeoman-
ry, that he might wear the yeomans
dress. A yeomanry dress is always a
handsome and respectable one.
	In 1838, when in Paris, he writes: I
have just come from seeing Marion Dc-
brine, the tragedy of Victor Hugo, and
am so sickened and disgusted with the
horrid piece that I have hardly heart
to write. He did not look through pain
and extravagance into the noble passion
of the play. He lived in a moral Pum-
pernickel where the ideal is kept outside
the town gates.
	Pumpernickel was his home, and he has
depicted it in Vanity Fair. This book
reflects Thackerays intellectual image
in his prime; it is his first great novel,
and is filled with the most vivid and en-
during of his beliefs and convictions.
There are in it a vigor, an independence,
and a sense of power that come when a
man faces his best opportunity. Into it
Thackeray has put what he deemed the
truest experiences of his life. He has
also written two long sequels to it. The
Newcomes is the story of his stepfather,

Fair; Pendennis, that of Thackeray him-
self and his mother wandering in its
outskirts. There is this one family of
nice people, gathered into an ark as it
were, floating over the muddy waters.
Thackeray was able to see that his im-
mediate family were not rogues; he was
also able to draw a most noble gentle-
man, Henry Esmond, by the help of the
idealizing lens of a hundred odd years;
but the world he thought he saw about
him is the world of Vanity Fair.
	Thackeray had so many fine qualities
that one cannot but feel badly to see him
in such a place. Had his virtues  his
kindness, his tenderness, his charm, his
capacity for affection  been energetic
enough to dominate his entire charac-
ter, he would have lived among far dif-
ferent scenes; his readers would have
beheld him potting flowers by some vine-
covered house in a village where neigh-
bors were simple, honest, and true, 
where round the corner stood a Mermaid
Tavern, to which poets and far-voyaging
sailors would come, full of stories about
a glorious world. Who would not have
liked to sit by Thackerays hearth in such
a home, a fire warming his kindly feet,
his good cheroot gayly burning, a mug
at his elbow, and he reading his last man-
uscript? Was it Thackerays fault that
this was not to be ? Or did he suffer
the incidental misfortunes which large
causes bring to individuals as they follow
their own regardless paths?

	Thackeray is the poet of respectabili-
ty. His working time stretches from the
Reform Act almost to the death of Lord
Palmerston. He chronicles the contem-
porary life of a rich, money-getting gen-
eration of merchants and manufacturers,

tional life by steamboats and railroads.

man and Macaulay the man of letters.
Macaulay, in his essay on Bacon, has
given us the measure of its spiritual
elevation: We have sometimes thought
that an amusing fiction might be writ-
ten, in which a disciple of Epictetus
and a disciple of Bacon should be intro-
duced as fellow travelers. They come
to a village where the smallpox has just
begun to rage, and find houses shut up,
intercourse suspended, the sick aban-
doned, mothers weeping in terror over
their children. The Stoic assures the
dismayed population that there is no-
thing bad in the smallpox; and that, to
a wise man, disease, deformity, death,
the loss of friends, are not evils. The
Baconian takes out a lancet and begins
to vaccinate. They find a body of min-
ers in great dismay. An explosion of
noisome vapors has just killed many of
those who were at work; and the sur-
vivors are afraid to venture into the
cavern. The Stoic assures them that
such an accident is nothing but a mere
Jwowpo~y~Evov. The Baconian, who has
no such fine word at his command, con-
tents himself with devising a safety-
lamp. They find a shipwrecked mer-
chant wringing his hands on the shore.
His vessel, with an inestimable cargo, has
just gone down, and he is reduced in a
moment from opulence to beggary. The
Stoic exhorts him not to seek happiness
in things which lie without himself; the
Baconian constructs a diving-bell. It
would be easy to multiply illustrations
of the difference between the philosophy
of thorns and the philosophy of fruit,
the philosophy of words and the phi-
losoplly of works. This is the very no-
bility of machinery. As we read, we
listen to the buzz and whir of wheels, the
drip of oil-cans, the creaking and strain-
ing of muscle and steel. Such things
serve, no doubt, in default of other agen-
cies, to create a great empire, but the
England of Thackerays day was a nou-
reau riche, self-made, proud of its lack
of occupation other than money-getting.</PB>

Thackeray was fallen upon evil times.
He was born into this moral estate of
Pumpernickel, and he has described it
with the vividness and vigor of complete
comprehension. He has immense cle-
verness. He knows whereof he talks.
Never has a period had so accomplished
an historian. The bourgeoisie have their
epic in Vanity Fair.
	During the formative period of Thack-
crays life the English nation was pass-
ing under the influence of machinery.
There was the opportunity of a great
man of letters, such as Thackeray, to
look to it that literature should respond
to the stimulus of added power, and grow
so potent that it would determine what
direction the national life should take.
At such a time of national expansion,
literature should have seen England in
the flush of coming greatness; it should
have roused itself to re-create her in no-
bler imagination, and have spent itself
in making her accept this estimate and
expectation, and become an England
dominatiugmaterial advantages and lead-
ing the world.
The interest in life is this potentiality
and malleability. The allotted task of
men and women is to take this poten-
tiality and shape it. Men who have
strong intelligence and quick perceptions,
like Thackeray, accomplish a great deal
in the way of giving a definite form to
the material with which life furnishes
us. What Michelangelo says of marble
is true of life: 
Non ha lottimo artista alcun concetto
Chun marmo solo in se non circoscriva
Col sno soverchio.

The problem of life is to uncover the
figures hiding in this material: shall it
be Caliban, Circe, Philip Sidney, Jeanne
dArc? Thackeray, with what Mrs.
IRitchie calls his great deal of common
sense, saw Major Pendennis and Becky
Sharp; and he gave more effective cut-
tings and chiselings and form to the po-
tential life of England than any other
man of his time.
	The common apology for such a nov-
elist is that he describes what he sees.
This is the worst with which we charge
him. We charge Thackeray with see-
ing what he describes; and what justi-
fication has a man, in a world like this,
to spend his time looking at Barnes New-
come and Sir Pitt Crawley? Thackeray
takes the motes and beams floating in his
minds eye for men and women, writes
about them, and calls his tale a history.
	Thackeray wrote, on finishing Vanity
Fair, that all the characters were odious
except Dobbin. Poor Thackeray, what
a world to see all about him, with his
tender, affectionate nature! Eveii Colo-
nel Newcome is so crowded round by
a mob of rascally fellows that it is hard
to do justice to Thackerays noblest at-
tenipt to be a poet But why see a world,
and train children to see a world, where

The great man is a vulgar clown?

A world with such an unreal standard
must be an unreal world. In the real
world vulgar clowns are not great men.
Thackeray sees a world all topsy-turvy,
and it does not occur to him that he, and
not the world, is at fault. This is the
curse of faithlessness. He himself says,
The world is a looking-glass, and gives
back to every man the reflection of his
own face.
	Thackeray has been praised as a mas-
ter of reality. As reality is beyond our
ken, the phrase is unfortunate; but the
significance of it is that if a man will
portray to the mob (he world with which
the mob is familiar, they will huzza
themselves hoarse. Has not the Pari-
sian mob shouted for Zola? Do not the
Madrileilos cheer Vald~s? Do not Oui-
da and the pale youth of Rome and
Paris holla,  dAnnunzio ! dAnnun-
zio!  There is no glory here. The
poet, not in fine frenzy, but in sober
simplicity, tells the mob, not what they
see, but what they cannot of themselves
perceive, with such a tone of authority
that they stand gaping and likewise see.</PB>

	Thackerays love of reality was mere-
ly an embodiment of the popular feeling
which proposed to be direct, business-
like, and not to tolerate any nonsense.
People felt that a money-getting country
must take itself seriously. The Reform
Act had brought political control to the
bourgeoisie, men of common sense; no
ranters, no will-o-the-wisp chasers, but
burgornasters arid great oneyers, 
men who thought very highly of circum-
stances under which they were prosper-
ous, and asked for no more beautiful
sight than their own virtues. Influenced
by the sympathetic touch of this atmo-
sphere, novel-readers found their former
favorites old-fashioned. Disraeli, Sam-
uel Warren, Bulwer Lytton, G. P. R.
James, seemed false, theatrical, and sen-
timental. Thackeray was of this opin-
ion, and he studied the art of caricature
as the surest means of saving himself
from any such fantastic nonsense. He
approached life as a city man,  one who
was convinced that the factories of Lon-
don, not the theories of the philosopher,
were the real motive force underneath
all the busy flow of outward life. He
found his talents exactly suited to this
point of view. His memory was an
enormous wallet, into which his hundred-
handed observation was day and night
tossing scraps and bits of daily experi-
ence. He saw the meetings of men as
he passed: lords, merchants, tiusmiths,
guardsnien, tailors, cooks, valets, nurses,
policemen, boys, applewomen,  every-
body whom you meet of a morning be-
tween your house and your office in the
city. He remarked the gestures, he
heard the words, he guessed what had
gone before, he divined what would hap-
pen thereafter: and each sight, sound,.
guess, and divination was safely stowed
away in his marvelous wallet. England
of the forties, as Thackeray saw it, is in
Vanity Fair, Pendennis, and The New-
comes. I ask you to believe, he says
in the preface to Pendennis, that this
person writing strives to tell the truth.
	Where lies the truth? Are men
merely outward parts of machinery, ex-
posed to view, while down below in the
engine - room steam and electricity de-
termine their movements? Or do men
live and carry on their daily routine un-
der the influence of some great thought
of which they are half unconscious, but
by which they are shaped, moulded, and
moved? A French poet says : 
Le vrai Dieu, le Dieu fort, est le Dien des
id6es.
But Macaulay says that the philosophy
of Plato began with words and ended
with words; that an acre in Middlesex
is better than a principality in Utopia.
The British public applauded Macaulay,
and young Thackeray took the hint.

Iv.

	Nobody can question Thackerays style.
His fame is proof of its excellence.
Even if a man will flatter the mob by say-
ing that he sees what they see, he can-
not succeed without skill of expression.
Readers are slow to understand. They
need grace, pithy sentences, witty turns
of phrase, calculated sweep of periods
and paragraphs. They must have no
labor of attention; the right adjective
alone will catch their eyes; they require
their pages plain, clear, perspicuous.
In all these qualities Thackeray is very
nearly perfect. Hardly anybody would
say that there is a novel better written
than Vanity Fair. The story runs as
easily as the hours. Chapter after chap-
ter in the best prose carries the reader
comfortably on. Probably this excel-
lence is due to Thackerays great powers
of observation. His eyes saw everything,
saving for the blindness of his inward
eye, and his memory held it. He was
exceedingly sensitive. Page after page
is filled with the vividness of well-chosen
detail. He cultivated the art of writing
most assiduously. From 1830 to 1847,
when Vanity Fair, the first of his great
novels, was published, he was writing all
the time, and for almost all of that time</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00720" SEQ="0720" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="714">	714	Some Aspects of Thackeray.

as a humorist, drawing caricatures,  a
kind of writing perhaps better adapted
than any other to cultivate the power of
portraying scenes. The caricaturist is
restricted to a few lines; his task does
not allow him to fill in, to amplify; he
must say his say in little. The success
of wit is the arrangement of a dozen
words. This training for sixteen contin-
uous years taught Thackeray a style
which, for his subjects, has no equal in
English literature.
	To-day we greatly admire Stevenson
and Kipling. We applaud Stevensons
style for its cultivation and its charm;
we heap praises upon Kiplings for its
dash, vigor, and accuracy of detail. All
these praises are deserved; but when
we take up Thackeray again, we find
pages and pages written in a style more
cultivated than Stevensons and equally
charming, and with a dash, vigor, and
nicety of detail that Kipling might envy.
Descriptions that would constitute the
bulk of an essay for the one, or of a story
for the other, do hasty service as pro-
logues to Thackerays chapters. Conver-
sations of a happy theatrical turn, with
enough exaggeration to appear wholly
natural, which Stevenson and Kipling
never have rivaled, come growding to-
gether in his long novels.
	There are two famous scenes which are
good examples of Thackerays power, 
one of his sentiment, one of his humor.
The first is Colonel Newcomes death in
the Charterhouse. The second is the
first scene between Pendennis and the
Fotheringay. Pen tried to engage
her in conversation about poetry and
about her profession. He asked her
what she thought of Ophelias madness,
and whether she was in love with Ham-
let or not. In love with such a little
ojus wretch as that stunted manager of
a Bingley? She bristled with indigna-
tion at the thought. Pen explained it
was not of her he spoke, but of Ophelia
of the play. Oh, indeed; if no offense
was meant. none was taken: but as for
Bingley, indeed, she did not value him.
 not that glass of punch. Pen next
tried her on Kotzebue. Kotzebue?
Who was he? The author of the
play in which she had been performing
so admirably. She did not know
that  the mans name at the beginning
of the book was, Thompson, she said.
Pen laughed at her adorable simplicity.
He told her of the melancholy fate of
the author of the play, and how Sand
had killed him. - . . How beautiful
she is! thought Pen, cantering home-
wards. How simple and how tender!
How charming it is to see a woman
of her genius busying herself with the
humble offices of domestic life, cooking
dishes to make her old father comfort-
able, and brewing him drink! How
rude it was of me to begin to talk about
professional matters, and how well she
turned the conversation! . . . Penden-
nis, Pendennis,  how she spoke the
word! Emily, Emily! how good, how
noble, how beautiful, how perfect, she
is
	This scene is very close upon farce,
and it is in that borderland that Thack-
crays extraordinary skill shows itself
most conspicuous. Difficult, however,
as it must be to be a master there,  and
the fact that Thackeray has no rival in
this respect proves it,  it is easy work
compared to drawing a scene of real love,
of passion. Perhaps some actions of
Lady Castlewood are Thackerays only
attempt thereat. The world of passion is
not his world. His ear is not attuned to
Das tiefe, schmerzenvolle Gliick
Des Hasses Kraft, die Maclit der Liebe.

Charlotte Bront~, Tourguenef, Haw-
thorne, Hugo, Balzac, all excel him.
Thackeray hears the click of custom
against custom, the throb of habit, the
tick-tick of vulgar life, all the sounds
of English social machinery. The dif-
ferent degrees of social efficiency and
inefficiency rivet his attention. What
interests him is the relation that Harry
Poker or Blanche Amory bears to the</PB>

standard of social excellence accepted
by commercial England in the forties.
He is never  at least as an artist  dis-
turbed by any scheme of metaphysics.
His English common sense is never
lured afield by any speculations about
the value of a human being uncolored
by the shadows of time and space. He
is never troubled by doubts of stan-
dards, by skepticism as to uses, ends,
purposes; he has a hard-and-fast Brit-
ish standard. He draws Colonel New-
come as an object of pity; he surrounds
him with tenderness and sympathy.
Here is Thackeray at his highest. But
he never suggests to the reader that Colo-
nel Newcome is not a man to be pitied,
but to be envied; not a failure, but a suc-
cess; not unhappy, but most fortunate.
The great poets of the world have turned
the malefactors cross into the symbol of
holiness. Thackeray never departs from
the British middle class conceptions of
triumph and failure. In all his numer-
ous dissertations and asides to the read-
er, he wrote like the stalwart Briton he
was, good, generous, moral, domestic,
stern, and tender. You never forget his
Puritan ancestry, you can rely upon his
honesty; but he is not pure-minded or
humble. He dislikes wrong, but he never
has a high enough conception of right
to hate wrong. His view is that it is a
matter to be cured by policemen, pro-
priety, and satire.
	Satire is the weapon of the man at
odds with the world and at ease with
himself. The dissatisfied man  a Ju-
venal, a Swift, a youthful Thackeray 
belabors the world with vociferous indig-
nation; like the wind on the travelers
back, the beating makes him hug his
cloaking sins the tighter. Wrong runs
no danger from such chastisement. The
fight against wrong is made by the man
discontented with himself and careless
of the world. Satire is harmless as a
moral weapon. It is an old - fashioned
fowling piece, fit for a man of wit, intel-
ligence, and a certain limited imagina
of Thackeray.
715
tion. It runs no risk of having no quar-
ry; the world to it is one vast covert of
lawful game. It goes a-traveling with
wit, because both are in search of the un-
worthy. It is well suited to a brilliant
style. It is also a conventional depart-
ment in literature, and as such is de-
manded by publishers and accepted by
the public.
	Thackeray was born with dexterity of
observation, nimbleness of wit, and a
quick sense of the incongruous and the
grotesque. He lost his fortune when a
young man. He wrote for a livelihood,
and naturally turned to that branch of
literature which was best suited to his
talents. It was his misfortune that satire
is bad for a mans moral development.
It intensified his natural disbelief in
the worth of humanity, but gave him the
schooling that enabled him to use his
powers so brilliantly.
	Thackeray was often hampered by
this habit of looking at the grotesque
side of things. It continually~dragged
him into farce, causing feebleness of
effect where there should have been
power. Sir Pitt Crawley, Jos Sedley,
the struggle over Miss Crawley, Harry
Foker, the Chevalier de Florac, Aunt
Hoggerty, are all in the realm of farce.
This is due partly to Thackerays train-
ing, and partly to his attitude toward life.
If life consists of money, clothes, and a
bundle of social relations, our daily gravi-
ty, determination, and vigor are farcical,
because they are so out of place; they
are as incongruous as a fish in trousers.
But Thackeray forgets that there is some-
thing disagreeable in this farce, as there
would be in looking into Circes sty and
seeing men groveling over broken meats.
To be sure, Thackeray makes believe
that he finds it comic to see creatures
of great pretensions busy themselves so
continually with the pettiest things. But
it too often seems as if the comic ele-
ment consisted in our human preten-
sions, and as if Thackeray merely kept
bringing them to the readers notice for</PB>

the sake of heightening the contrast be-
tween men and their doings.

V.

	Thackeray is not an innovator; he
follows the traditions of English litera-
ture, lie is in direct descent from the
men of the Spectator, Addison, Steele,
and their friends, and from Fielding.
He has far greater powers of observa-
tion, wit, humor, sentiment, and descrip-
tion than the Spectator group. He ex-
cels Fielding in everything except as a
story-teller, and in a kind of intellectual
power that is more easily discerned in
Fielding than described,  a kind of im-
perious understanding that breaks down
a path before it, whereas Thackerays in-
telligence looks in at a window or peeps
through the keyhole. Fielding is the
bigger, coarser man of the two; Thack-
eray is the cleverer. Each is thorough-
ly English. Fielding embodies the Eng-
land of George I.; Thackeray, that same
England refined by the revolutionary
ideas of 1789, trained by long wars,
then materialized by machinery, by a
successful bourgeoisie and the quick ac-
cession of wealth. Each is a good fel-
low,  quick in receiving ideas, but slow
to learn a new point of view. Field-
ing is inferior to Thackeray in educa-
tion, in experience of many men, and in
foreign travel. Tom Jones is the beget-
ter of Arthur Pendennis, Jonathan Wild
of Barry Lyndon. Some of Fieldings
heroines, wandering out of Toni Jones
and Amelia, have strayed into Penden-
nis, Vanity Fair, and The Newcomes.
The fair 6migr6es change their names,
but keep their thoughts and behavior.
	It is said that a lady once asked
Thackeray why he made all his women
fools or knaves. Madam, I know no
others. It may be tbat living in Paris
in his youth hurt his insight into women;
it may be that the great sorrow of his
wifes insanity instinctively turned his
thoughts from the higher types of wo-
men; perhaps his life in Bohemia and
in clubs limited his knowledge during
the years when novel-writing was his
chief occupation. The truth seems to
be that Tbackeray, like Fielding, was a
mans man,  he understood one cross-
section of a common man, his hopes, aims,
fears, wishes, habits, and manners; but he
was very ignorant of women. He says:
Desdemona was not angry with Cassio,
though there is very little doubt she saw
the lieutenants partiality for her (and
I, for my part, believe that many more
things took place in that sad affair than
the worthy Moorish oflicer ever knew
of); why, Miranda was even very kind
to Caliban, and we may be pretty sure
for the same reason. INot that she would
encourage him in the least, the poor
uncouth monster,  of course not.
Shakespeare and Thackeray looked dif-
ferently at women.
	Thackeray lacked the poets eye; he
could not see and was not troubled.
Ahi quanto nella mente mi commossi,
	Quando mi volsi per veder Beatrice,
Per non poter vedere, ben chio fossi
Presso di lei, e nel mondo felice!

But poor Thackeray was never near the
ideal, and never in paradise. Some
critic has said of him that because he
had Eden in his minds eye, this world
appeared a Vanity Fair. No criticism
could be more perverted; he had Vanity
Fair in his minds eye, and therefore
could not see paradise.
	This treatment of women is half from
sheer ignorance, and half from Thack-
erays habit of dealing in caricature
with subjects of which he is ignorant.
He behaves toward foreign countries
very much as he does toward women.
France, Germany, Italy, appear like
geography in an opera bouffe. They are
places for English blackguards to go to,
and very fit places for them, tenanted as
they are by natives clad in outlandish
trousers, and bearded and moustachioed
like pards. His delineations of Germany,
and those pen-and-ink sketches by Rich-
ard Doyle in his delightful Brown, Jones</PB>

and Robinson, made so strong an impres-
sion upon an ignorant portion of the pub-
lie, of which we were, that it was fright-
ened to death in 1871, when it thought
of the French armies trampling down
poor little Germany. Thackeray looked
on Germany, as he did upon the world,
with the greedy eye of the caricaturist,
and he could not refrain from his gro-
tesque sketches. Of the French he says:
In their aptitude to swallow, to utter,
to enact humbugs, these French people,
from Majesty downwards, beat all the
other nations of this earth. In looking
at these men, their manners, dresses,
opinions, politics, actions, history, it is im-
possible to preserve a grave countenance;
instead of having Carlyle to write a His-
tory of the French Revolution, I often
think it should be handed over to Dick-
ens or Theodore Hook. . . . I can hardly
bring my mind to fancy that anything is
serious in France,  it seems to be all
rant, tinsel, and stage-play. His atti-
tude toward French literature is dis-
torted by lack of sympathy to an aston-
ishing degree.
	Thackerays fault was not merely a
certain narrowness of mind, but also
that he allowed himself to see only the
grotesque and disagreeable, until habit
and nature combined to blind him to
other things.

	Thackeray is not a democrat. Demo-
cracy, like many another great and vague
social conception, is based upon a funda-
mental truth, of which truth adherents
to the conception are often ignorant,
although they brusb against it in the
dark and unwittingly draw in strength
for their belief. The fundamental truth
of democracy is that the real pleasures
of life are increased by sharing them, 
that exclusiveness renders pleasure in-
sipid. One reason why democracy has
prevailed so greatly is that everywhere,
patent to everybody, in the simplest
family life, there is proof of this truth.
A man amuses himself skipping stones:
the occupation has a pleasure hardly to
be detected; with a wife it is interest-
ing, with children it becomes exciting.
Every new sharer adds to the fathers
stock of delight, so that at last he lies
awake on winter nights thinking of the
summers pleasure. With a slight appli-
cation of logic, democrats have struggled,
and continually do struggle, to break
down all the bastions, walls, fences, and
demilunes that time, prejudice, and igno-
rance have erected between men. They
wish to have a ready channel from man
to man, through which the emotional
floods of life can pour;
For they, at least,
ilave dreamd [that] hnman hearts might blend
In one, and were through faith released
From isolation without end.

	What is the meaning of patriotism?
Does the patriot think his country wiser,
better, more gifted, more generous, than
another? Perhaps, and in this he is al-
most certainly wrong; but the power of
patriotism to disregard truth lies in the
fact that it is one of the most powerful
conductors of human emotion ever dis-
covered. It is part of the old human
cry, Self is so small; make me part of
something large. Esprit de corps, which
makes people unreasonable and troubles
the calculations of the bloodless man, is
a like conductor of the emotions in lesser
matters; and the fact is familiar that
the larger the body, the greater is the
emotion generated.
	Humanity has had a hard task in
civilizing itself; in periods of ignorance,
ill humor, and hunger it has built up a
most elaborate system, which has been
a great factor in material prosperity.
This system is the specialization of labor,
which serves to double the necessary
differences among men, and to make
every specialty and every difference a
hindrance to the joys that should be in
commonalty spread. The age of ma-
chinery increased specialization, special-
ization increased wealth, wealth was
popularly supposed to be the panacea</PB>

for human ills; and the bars and bar-
riers between men were repaired and
strengthened. Specialization in Thack-
crays time was in the very air; every-
thing was specialized,  trade was spe-
cialized, society was specialized, money
was specialized; there was money made,
money inherited from father, money in-
herited from grandfather,  money, like
blood, growing purer and richer the
further back it could be traced. Every
act of specialization produced a new
batch of social relations.
	Thackeray is very sensitive, especial-
ly to this elaborate system of special-
ization, and to its dividing properties,
strengthened and repaired by the com-
mercial Briton. Thackeray has no gift
for abstraction; he does not take a man
and grow absorbed in him as a spiritual
being, as a creature in relations with
some Absolute; he sees men shut off
and shut up in all sorts of little coops.
He is all attentive to the coops. The
world to him is one vast zotilogical gar-
den, this Vanity Fair of his. He does
not care that the creatures are living,
growing, eating, sun-needing animals;
he is interested in the feathers, the curl
of the tail, the divided toe, the pink
eye, the different occupations, clothes,
habits, which separate them into differ-
ent groups. A democrat does not care
for such classification; on the contrary,
he wishes to efface it as much as pos-
sible. He wishes to abstract man from
his conditions and surroundings, and
contemplate him as a certain quantity of
human essence. He looks upon the dis-
tinctions of rank, of occupation, of cus-
toins and habits, as so many barricades
upon the great avenues of human emo-
tions; Napoleon-like, he would sweep
them away. He regards man as a seri-
ous reality, and these accidents of social
relations as mere shadows passing over.
This is the Christian position. This is
the attitude of Victor Hugo, George
Eliot, George Sand, Hawthorne, Tourge-
nef, Tolstoi, Charlotte Bront~.
	No wonder that Charlotte Bronte
made this criticism upon Thackerays
face: To me the broad brow seems to
express intellect. Certain lines about
the nose and cheek betray the satirist
and cynic; the mouth indicates a child-
like simplicity,  perhaps even a degree
of irresoluteness, inconsistency,  weak-
ness, in short, but a weakness not un-
amiable... . A certain not quite Chris-
tian expression. This is a true like-
ness. Thackeray was not a Christian.
He acted upon all the standards which
Christianity has proclaimed to be false
for nearly two thousand years. He had
a certain childlike simplicity. Some of
his best passages proceed upon it. Take
the chapters in Vanity Fair where
Anielia is neglected by Osborne, or the
scene at Colonel Newcomes death.
These incidents are described as they
would appear to a child. The impres-
sions seem to have been dinted on the
sensitive, inexperienced mind of a child.
This quality is Thackerays highest. He
is able to throw off the dust of years,
and see things with the eyes of a child,
not a child trailing glory from the east,
but one bred in healthful ignorance.
	Walter Bagehot, in his essay on Sterne
and Thackeray, compares the two, and,
after describing Sternes shiftless, lazy
life, asks, What can there be iii common
between him and the great Thackeray,
industrious and moral? Bagehot found
that the two had sensitiveness in com-
mon. There is another likeness,  a cer-
tain lack of independence, a swimming
with the stream. Thackeray has an
element of weakness; it appears continu-
ally in his method of writing novels. He
puts his character before you, but he
never suffers you to consider it by your.
self; he is nervously suggesting this and
that; he is afraid that you may misjudge
what he conceives to be his own correct
moral standard. He points out how
virtuous he really is, how good and no-
ble. He keeps underscoring the badness
of his bad people, and the weakness of</PB>

his weak people. He is like a timid
mother, who will not let her brood out
of sight while any one is looking at them.
Moreover, his satire never attacks any-
body or anything that a man could be
found publicly to defend. He charges
upon social malef actors who are absolute-
ly defenseless. He belabors brutality,
avarice, boorishness, knavery, prevarica-
tion, with most resounding thwacks.
	In the year 1847 Vanity Fair was
published. Thackeray won great fame
as the terrible satirist of society. And
what did society do? Society invited
him to dinner, in the correct belief that
it and Thackeray agreed at every point.
We think that such satire betrays a cer-
tain weakness and lack of courage. Did
the Jesuits invite IMIoli~re to dinner after
Tartuffe?
	Thackerays face had, according to
the criticism we have quoted, a weak-
ness not unamiable. Certainly Thack-
eray was not unamiable; lie must have
been most lovable in many ways. The
childlike characteristic to which we have
alluded is enough to prove that; and in
chapter after chapter we find evidence
of his human kindliness. Take, for ex-
ample, the passage quoted by Mr. Men-
vale, in his somewhat pugnacious Life
of Thackeray, from Titmarshs letter
on Napoleons funeral at Les Invalides.
Here is a description of an English
family in three generations, a somewhat
foolish family, perhaps, given with some
affectation, but perfectly genuine in its
sympathy with childish hopes and fears.
His books are full of passages of a like
character. If further evidence were
needed, Mrs. Ritchies prefaces to this
new edition supply it most abundantly.

	A novelist, however, in the end, must
be judged according to a common human
measure. This the novelist, like other
men devoted to special pursuits, resents;
he interposes a claim of privilege, and
demands a trial by his peers. He claims
that as a man he may be judged by
Tom, Dick, and Harry, but as a novelist
 in that noble and sacrosanct capacity
 he is only within the jurisdiction of
men acquainted with the difficulties and
triumphs of his art. This is the old
error,  the Manichean heresy of trying
to divide the one and indivisible into
two. It reminds one of Gibbons I
sighed as a lover, I obeyed as a son.
It is the character of the novelist that
provides tissue for his novels; there is
no way by which the novelist can sit
like an absentee god and project into
the world a work that tells no tales of
him. Every man casts his work in his
own image. Only a great man writes a
great novel; only a mean man writes a
mean novel. A novel is as purely a per-
sonal thing as a hand-shake, and is to be
judged by a simple standard which every-
body can understand.
	There has been a foolish confusion of
nomenclature, due to the desire of critics
to make a special vocabulary for them-
selves, partly to the end that they may
be known to be critics, partly to shut
themselves off into a species of the liter-
ary genus that shall be judged only by
members of the same species. Hence
the silly words idealism~ and real-
ism. M. de Maupassant says: How
childish it is to believe in reality, since
each of us carries his own in his mind!
Our eyes, ears, noses, tastes, create as
many different varieties of truth as there
are men in the world. And we who re-
ceive the teachings of these senses, af-
fected each in his own way, analyze,
judge, and come to our conclusions as if
we all were of different races. Each
creates an illusion of the world for him-
self, poetical, sentimental, gay, melan-
choly, ugly, or sad, according to his na-
ture. This is a correct statement, but
it does not go far enough. The world
not only looks different to different peo-
ple, bat, as it is the most delicately
plastic and sensitive matter imaginable,
it is always tending to become for any</PB>

community what the man in that com-
munity with the greatest capacity for
expression thinks it is. Like an old
Polonius, the city, the village, or the
household sees the world in shape like
a camel, or backed like a weasel or a
whale, according as the prince among
them thinks. Consider a fashion in
criticism or in dress. Sir Joshua Rey-
nolds admired Annibale Carracci, and
all the people who looked at pictures,
in very truth, saw beautiful pictures by
the great, glorious Annibale. A group
of dressmakers and ladies of quality in
Paris wear jackets with tight sleeves, and
every city-bred woman in France, Eng-
land, and America sees the beauty of
tight sleeves and the hideousness of loose
sleeves.
	Strictly speaking, everything is real
and everything is ideal. The world is
but an aggregate of opinions. The man
who sees an ugly world is as pure an
idealist as he who sees a glorious orb
rising like the sun. The question for
poor humanity is, Shall the earth shine
or float dead and dull through eternity?
Every man who sees it golden helps to
gild it; every man who sees it leaden
adds to its dross.
	Shall we look with Miranda?

0, wonder!
low many goodly creatures are there here!
How	beauteous mankind is! 0 brave new
world,
That has such people in t!

Or with Timon?
	The learned pate
Dncks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
There s nothing level in our cursed natures,
But direct villauy.

The novelist is on the same standing-
ground as another; only he has the
greater influence, and therefore the
greater responsibility. This world and
all which inherit it are a dream; why
not make it a nobler dream than it is?
	Before this great act of creation, the
petty details of the novelists craft  plot,
story, arrangement, epigram, eloquence
 drop off like last years leaves. These
details will always find individuals to
study them, to admire them, to be fond
of them. They will have their reward,
they add to the interest of life, they fill
the vacant niches in the rich mans
time, they embroider and spangle. They
quicken our wits, stimulate our lazy at-
tentions, spice our daily food, help us to
enjoy; but they must not divert our at-
tention from the great interest of life, the
struggle between rival powers for the pos-
session of the world. It is a need com-
mon to us and to those who shall come
after us, that the world suffer no detri-
ment in our eyes. We must see what
poets see; one cannot help but dogmatize
and say that it is base to believe the world
base. We need faith; we cannot do
without the power of noble expectation~
Is that lope Faith, that lives in thought
On comforts which this world postpones,
That idly looks on life and groans
And shuns the lessons love has taught;

Which deems that after three score years,
Love, peace and joy become its due,
That timid wishes should come true
In some safe spot untouched by fears?

Or has he Faith who looks on life
As present chance to prove his heart,
As time to take the better part,
And stronger grow by constant strife;

Who does not see the mean, the base,
But sees the strong, the fresh, the true,
Old hearts, old homes forever new,
And all the world a glorious place;

So bent that they he loves shall find
This earth a home both rich and fair,
That he is careless to be heir
To all inheritance behind?

THE UNITED STATES AND THE CONTROL OF THE TROPICS.

THE editor of The Atlantic Monthly
has written me the following letter 
In your suggestive volume on the
control of the tropics you declare it futile
that any first-class world-power should
hope in the future to fold its hands and
stand aloof from the tropics. You say
that there can be no choice in the matter,
and that with the filling up of the tem-
perate regions and the continued devel-
opment of industrialism, rivalry for the
trade of the tropics will be the largest
factor in the era upon which we are en-
tering. You declare that, by reason of
past experience, we have now come face
to face with the following conclusions
regarding the tropics: 
The ethical development that has
taken place in our civilization has ren-
dered the experiment once made to de-
velop their resources by forced native
labor no longer possible, or permissible,
even if possible.
	We have already abandoned, un-
der pressure of experience, the idea,
which at one time prevailed, that the
tropical regions might be occupied and
permanently colonized by European
races, as vast regions in the temperate
climes have been.
	Within a measurable period in the
future, and under pressure of experience,
we shall probably also have to abandon
the idea, which has in like manner pre-
vailed for a time, that the colored races,
left to themselves, possess the qualities ne-
cessary to the development of the rich re-
sources of the lands they have inherited.
	The only method left, therefore, in
your opinion, is that the tropics must be
governed from a base in the temperate
regions; and, in particular,  and in
this you make a new departure,  be
governed by the nations which undertake
such work as a trust for civilization.
This solution of the problem of the
tropics Great Britain has begun to make
in the case of Egypt. But Great Brit-
ain is already a world-wide empire, and
has developed by long experience the
methods and machinery for exercising
such control.
	You refrain, in your book on the
control of the tropics,  no doubt pur-
posely,  from saying whether, in your
judgment, the United States has incurred
obligations by her victory over Spain to
take a share in the development of the
tropics, and whether the United States is
politically able to enter upon such a ca-
reer. The body of opinion in the United
States that opposes a policy of expan-
sion bases its objections on these three
propositions: (1) that the traditions of
the United States are directly and strong-
ly opposed to a policy of expansion, and
have been so opposed from George Wash-
ingtons Farewell Address to the present
time; (2) that a dangerous if not an
insuperable practical difficulty to a pol-
icy of expansion is found in the ineffi-
cient civil service of the United States;
and (3) that the control of colonies is
illogical for the United States, because
such a policy directly contradicts the
fundamental proposition on which the</PB>

republican form of government rests, 
that it shall consist only of self-govern-
ing commonwealths. In view of these
objections, do you bold that the United
States could safely enter upon a policy
of expansion?

	The questions asked in this letter are
so very important, and bear so closely
upon a great public issue about which
it is the right and duty of the people
of the United States alone to express a
direct opinion, that I feel some difficulty
in replying to them. Let me take the
propositions in order, and deal first with
the policy of expansion. I have recently
been traveling over a large part of the
United States, particularly in the West.
I have been as far west as the Pacific
coast, passing over two main lines of
communication, out one way and back
another, stopping at various places, and
living amongst the people a good deal.
On this subject of expansion I talked
with the people generally. It was im-
possible to avoid the subject. I was
struck by two great bodies of opinion, as
I might call them, on the question of ex-
pansion. One of these I might describe
as being a sort of unreasoning body of
opinion; that is to say, it has not been
reasoned out. It takes the shape in the
popular mind of a pronounced and even
intense feeling that in this matter of ex-
pansion the duty of the United States is
clear. Ask the farmers and business
men in the West why the course which
they propose is the duty of America.
They will give no direct reason or logical
reason, as far as I could find out. But
they are, nevertheless, perfectly decided
about one thing, and that is that this
thing has got to be done. You ask,
What thing? and they reply, Why,
that America should keep a stiff upper
lip to the world; should hold that which
she has not sought, but which has come
to her; should keep what she has got.
She must, in short, in a favorite phrase,
be true to her own destiny.
	Now that is one body of opinion.
There is also another great body of
opinion, largely prevaihiiig amongst the
reasoning classes in the United States.
Many men of this class undoubtedly hold
strongly that the government is about
to embark upon a very responsible ex-
periment,  perhaps an experiment in
which there is a considerable element of
danger.
	With regard to the first body of opin-
ion, which is a serious force it seemed to
me in most places, I tried to explain to
myself what this feeling is which finds
expression as the destiny of America
now to be carried forward in a policy of
expansion. I can only put the matter
in the shape in which it has presented
itself to my own mind.
	To get at the underlying meaning of
that great phase of world-development
which is now culminating in the United
States, it would appear to be necessary
to go a little distance back into the past:
we must take up the threads of European
history. As European history is coming
to be understood at the present day,
there is a principle which is gradually
emerging into the view of the student,
and growing clearer and clearer even to
the general mind. If we look back over
a short period it may perhaps fail to at-
tract attention, but when we extend the
view over a few centuries there can be
no mistaking it. At first sight this his-
toric principle of development or prin-
ciple of movement in European affairs
may be described as the gradual move-
ment of power northward; when it is
regarded more closely, it is possible to
see that it is something more than this.
Underneath all the outward national quar-
rels of Europe there has been going on
for centuries what is really a strugglo
between what we might call the Latin
type of civilization, represented by the
southern races, and that type of civiliza-
tion which has been developed in north-
ern Europe.
	We first catch sight of it early in the</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00729" SEQ="0729" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="723">The United States and the Control of the Tropics.

history of the German Empire. It may
be seen there how German unity was a
sort of ideal which the German people
had put before them a long way back in
the centuries; how the German people
sought to realize that ideal; and how the
German people were constantly thwarted
by a set of influences from southern
Europe, in which at first the influence of
Spain, and later the influence of Austria,
predcminated. It has been only in our
own time that the ideal of German unity
has been realized, and the rise of Prus-
sia becomes, as Professor Acton sees it,
the most significant historical phenome-
non in the history of modern Continental
Europe. Again, we see Spain joined in
a tremendous world - struggle with the
Dutch. It is impossible to read Motleys
History of the Dutch Republic without
vividly feeling what a momentous strug-
gle it was, and with what cost to the
Netherlands it was waged. Although the
Dutch emerged from it eventually victo-
rious, and were for some time afterward
a leading power in Europe, much of the
life - blood of the people had certainly
been sucked.
	Finally the conflict may be observed
in its last and most significant phase. To
take up the threads we must go a little
distance back to where we find Spain con-
fronting England in Elizabethan times,
with apparently an overwhelming advan-
tage o~i the side of the former country.
Slowly the outwardly stronger power
goes down, and toward the end of the
eighteenth century it is France, with
Spain behind her, which stands confront-
ing England throughout the world. Even
yet historians have scarcely fathomed
the meaning of the great struggle that
culminated in what is known as the Na-
poleonic wars. Up to recent times Pro-
fessor Seeley has probably been the only
English historian who has risen to the
philosophical position of seeing that that
contest was in reality a duel, in which
France, with Spain behind her, had
joined with England for the future of the
world,  a duel in which the real is~sue
was whether Latin civilization or that
kind of civilization with which England
had become identified was to be predom-
inant. The whole Napoleonic era, as
Seeley puts it, was but a struggle against
the world-expansion of the English prin-
ciple, and Napoleon tried to conquer
the whole continent of Europe because
he realized that he could not otherwise
conquer England.
	The cost of the conflict to England
was enormous. It is impossible to give
figures which would bring home to the
mind the real extent of the sacrifices
made. Toward the close of the war
Great Britains population was about
17,000,000. But before peace was re-
stored that comparatively small nation,
at a period when money was very scarce
and of higher value than it is now, had
incurred a national debt of about $4,000,-
000,000.
	It is not yet perceived in America
that one of the principal results of this
prolonged struggle has been, not the se-
cession of the United States from Eng-
land, which was but an incident and of
the nature of a development, but rather
that the North American continent of
the present day speaks English, and not
French; and that the immense inherit-
ance of that continent belongs to the type
of civilization which the United States
now represents, and not to any other type.
	But to present the history of this de-
velopment in its next chapter w~ have
to take a large canvas; for it is neces-
sary to find room for the whole North
American continent. Looking at the
map of North America immediately
before the period when the United
States began its career as a nation, we
have a remarkable spectacle. A little
fringe of English-speaking people, some
5,000,000 in number, occupied the terri-
tory along the Atlantic seaboard. The
French occupied the broad hinterland
of the Mississippi Valley. The Span-
iards were in possession in the south;
723</PB>

they held also the great territories along
the Pacific seaboard. This English-
speaking territory is little more than a
patch on the map, surrounded by terri-
tories belonging to one or other of almost
all the leading powers of Europe. Yet
we look again toward the end of the
nineteenth century, and a wonderful
transformation has taken place; a later
and vaster chapter of the world-move.
ment, of which we had the opening
chapters in another hemisphere, has
been enacted. North, south, west, from
Atlantic to Pacific, from seaboard to sea-
board, the great wave of English-speak-
ing civilization has flowed, submerging,
nay, obliterating all other forms. Not a
square mile of territory, once won, has
ever been given back. The meaning of
Washingtons Farewell Address, deliv-
ered when the United States contained
only about 6,000,000 people, surrounded
on every side by hostile powers and hos-
tile natural conditions, appears to be
lost when the 6,000,000 have grown to
70,000,000, and are already reckoning
the day when they will be 200,000,000.
The people whom Henry Adams de-
scribed as living at the beginning of the
nineteenth century in an isolation like
that of the Jutes and Angles of the fifth
century have tamed a continent, have
covered it with a vast network of the
most magnificent railroads in the world,
have grown to be the largest and most
homogeneous nation on the face of the
earth, with a great world-movement be-
hind it, and certainly a great world-part
in the future before it. It is because the
man in the Western states to-day, in a
dim instinctive way, realizes these things,
because he has himself been in the midst
of this development, and has even been
a factor in it, that he seems to be willing
to take the risks which more theoretical
minds hesitate at. That was the answer
which I gave myself. To look closer at
the matter is only to have the importance
of it brought home with increased force.
	The struggle above described has been
going on ever since, and it is but the last
phase of it that we have had in America
in the recent war with Spain. Yet the
conditions are slowly changing. A lead-
ing factor in the future history of the
world is that it is the probable destiny
of the United States, at no distant time,
to become the leading section of the
English-speaking world; nay, not only
that, but to become the leading world-
power of the next century. Now, if the
United States is going to be a great world-
power in the next century, it would seem
to be almost impossible to conceive that
it will be able to escape the effect of its
connection with what are really world-
principles, and these world-principles will
involve very important relationships to
the world in the future. The first mat-
ter with which it will undoubtedly be
concerned is the trade of the world.
	It is not possible to conceive the North
American continent as occupied by per-
haps 200,000,000 people in the near fu-
ture, without considering these inhabit-
ants as having behind them a world-trade.
Some persons seem to think that a coun-
try may have an export trade without
an import trade. It is an economic law
that even that is impossible. When we
come to look at the world of the present
day, it may be seen at once that most
of the developments that have gone on
in the past have been those which have
taken place in the temperate regions.
We of the more vigorous races have
been occupied during the last century or
two with colonizing, spreading ourselves
over, and taming the temperate regions
of the world. That era, it would seem,
will not last much longer; it is slowly
but surely coming to a close. Within a
time which many of us will live to see,
the American continent will be settled
up; it is very nearly settled up already,
in the agricultural sense. The next era
of expansion, which we are almost in
the midst of, is the great era of indus-
trial expansion, manufacturing expan-
sion,  an era of expansion which will</PB>

undoubtedly bring the United States into
very important relations with the trade
of the world. The people of the United
States will be driven to seek the widest
possible outside market for their indus-
trial productions; they must be able to
buy raw material in outside markets; and
they will have behind them, as they will
come to realize more and more clearly,
a great history, for they will be the lead-
ing representatives of definite principles
in the development of the world.
Now let us see what this trade means.
It would seem that there can be little
doubt that the trade of the world in the
future will be largely a trade with the
tropics. The tropics are naturally the
most richly endowed portion of the world.
Under proper conditions of administra-
tion, the possibilities of production in
the tropics are immensely greater than
the possibilities of production in the
temperate regions. Even with the ex-
tremely unfavorable conditions which at
present prevail in the tropics, as I have
elsewhere tried to show, our civilization
already rests to a large extent on its
trade with the tropics. As regards
Americas share in this trade, I may re-
peat here the analysis that I have al-
ready made in my little volume: 
Looking down the import list [of the
United States] for 1895, and taking the
fifteen heads under which the largest
values were imported, we find that they
include some two thirds of the total im-
ports of the United States. A glance
at the principal commodities is sufficient
to show to what an enormous extent the
produce of the tropics is represented.
Here the two items which stand at the
top of the list are coffee and sugar, of
which the imports were valued at, respec-
tively, $96,000,000 and $76,000,000.
The value of the imports of these two
articles alone does not fall very far short
of one fourth of the total value of the
imports of the United States for the year
in question. If we add to it the values
under three other heads,  namely, (1)
india rubber, (2) tobacco, and (3) tea,
 we have a total of about $221,000,-
000. If we endeavor to deal with the
whole import list, and seek to distin-
guish what proportion of the total im-
ports of the United States comes from
the region embraced between latitude
300 north and 30~ south of the equator,
we get a total value of, approximate-
ly, $250,000,000 from tropical regions.
This is over one third of the entire im-
ports of the United States, the total for
the year from all sources being $731,-
000,000. In the case of the exports of
the United States the currents of trade
are somewhat different, about forty-seven
per cent of the entire export trade being
with the United Kingdom. But of the
remainder, the export trade to the tropics
forms a large proportion, amounting in
all to, approximately, $96,000,000.
	Adding together, therefore, the ex-
ports and imports of the United States,
we have a remarkable analysis of the
entire trade of the country as follows : 
Trade of the United States in
	1895 with the tropics . . . $346,000,000
With the English-speaking world
	(not including British tropics) 657,000,000

Total with the tropics and Eng-
lish-speaking world. . . . $1,003,000,000
With the rest of the world . . 535,000,000
Gross total	$1,538,000,000

	If we exclude consideration of trade
within the English-speaking regions, the
total trade of the United States with
the tropics in 1895 was $346,000,000
as against $535,000,000 with the re-
mainder of the world. This is a very
striking and pregnant fact when we con-
sider existing conditions. It must al-
ways be kept in view, too, that no nation
can remain permanently indifferent to
the condition of a country with which it
has large and vital trade relations. Al-
though the United States interfered in
Cuba in the cause of humanity, it must</PB>

be remembered that it was the close
trade connection of the American people
with the island which directly and f or-
cibly compelled the attention of the pub-
lie mind to what was taking place there.
For all these reasons, it seems hard to
believe that the traditions of the past,
which opposed a policy of expansion on
the part of the United States, will ope-
rate with the same force in the future.
	For the same reason that expansion
appears to the Western man to be inev-
itable, there is a disposition to regard
with equanimity the apparently insu-
perable practical difficulty to a policy of
expansion in the inefficient civil service
of the United States. One of the most
remarkable, and, if I mistake not, one
of the most healthy symptoms of public
life in America, is a disposition to regard
with a cheerful optimism those problems
of government which do so much to de-
press the English observer. As yet,
America probably has not taken serious-
ly in hand the treatment of these pro-
blems, and the results will likely enough
be striking when the task is earnestly
undertaken. The United States is the
highest, and yet the youngest, of all po-
litical organisms in the world,  an or-
ganism with a promise and a potentiality
behind it of which there has been no
previous parallel; but it has hardly had
time to attend to the problems, the slow
solution of which has taken hundreds of
years in other countries. There seems
to be no insurmountable reason why there
should not be as efficient a civil service in
the United States as there is in England.
The principle which has been followed
in England has been the keeping of the
permanent civil service, abroad even
more than at home, apart from the tra-
ditions and influences of political parties.
In England the one consistent idea which,
through all outward forms, has in late
years been behind the institution of the
higher Indian civil service on existing
lines is that, even where it is equally
open to natives with Europeans through
competitive examination, entrance to it
shall be made through a British univer-
sity. In other words, it is the best and
most distinctive product that England
can give, the higher ideals and stan-
dards of her universities, which is made
to feed the inner life from which the
British administration of India proceeds.
	In the United States, the university
system of education has already reached
a kind of development which is far in ad-
vance of anything that we have in Eng-
land. There is a magnificent recruiting-
ground existing from which to build up
a civil service with high traditions of
public duty. If the nation rises to the
level of the occasion, insists on going
straight in this matter from the begin-
ning, there seem to be all the possibili-
ties of the very best results. But it will
be necessary to pay salaries adequate to
the positions and responsibilities of the
officials. In England there is a motto
to the effect that power must be paid.
If it is not paid by the state, it tends to
pay itself, directly or indirectly, from
other sources, and to serve the interests,
not of the state, but of those who pay it.
	As to the question implied in the third
proposition I have no right to reply. It
is a matter exclusively for the American
people. I would point out, however, that
in this question the control of colonies
by the United States is spoken of. One
of the leading principles that I have tried
to enunciate in my book on the control
of the tropics is that such territories can
never be colonies; that the white man
can never be acclimatized in the tropics;
that such regions must continue to be
permanently peopled by their natural in-
habitants; and that the highest duty of
the civilized power that undertakes re-
sponsibility in relation thereto is to see
that they shall be governed, not in the
interest of the governing power, but as
a trust for civilization.
	As to the logic of the situation, that
is also a matter solely for the American
people. Yet it is one of the deepest</PB>

truths of philosophy that the meaning
of living things cannot be put into logical
formulas. The spirit behind the Consti-
tution of the United States is probably
one of the most vital and healthy things
in the world; and yet, under the Con-
stitution itself, there are already the most
illogical results. One of the funda-
mental principles of government in the
United States is the assumption of the
right of every citizen to liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. The negro is a
citizen of the United States, and yet in
some states of the Union he is forbid-
den to marry a citizen of a different
color. The Indian is a ward of the
United States, and not a citizen; and
the Chinaman is forbidden a vote. All
this is illogical. But it is not therefore
wrong; and the fact rempins that the
spirit behind the American Constitution
is probably one of the healthiest forces
in the world. The intense feeling of
the Western man that there is a mean-
ing and a reason behind a policy of ex-
pansion which cannot be put into formu.
las  which it is not even necessary to
put into formulas  has more in it than
appears on the surface; it may be near-
er to the real meaning of things than
the most thoroughly reasoned argument.
We have not had a more philosophical
historian in England than Professor See-
ley, certainly none who has understood
better the meaning of the principles be-
hind the expansion of the English-speak-
ing races. It was he who, writing about
such principles, delivered himself of this
remarkable saying: In a truly living
institution the instinct of development
is wiser than the utterances of the wis-

Old Glory,  speak out! We are asking about
How you happened to favor a name, so to say,
That sounds so familiar and careless and gay,
As we cheer it, and shout in our wild, breezy way

And hurrahing Old Glory! like you were our kin,
When  Lord /  we all know we re as common as sin!

And waft us your thanks, as we hail you and fall
Into line, with you over us, waving us on
Where our glorified, sanctified betters have gone.

Is what the plain facts of your christening were, 
For your name  just to hear it,
Repeat it, and cheer it, s a tang to the spirit
As salt as a tear:
And seeing you fly, and the boys marching by,
There s a shout in the throat and a blur in the eye,
And an aching to live for you always  or die,
If, dying, we still keep you waving on high.
And so, by our love
For you, floating above,
And the scars of all wars and the sorrows thereof,
Who gave you	the name of Old Glory, and why
Are we thrilled at the name of Old Glory?

Iken the old banner leaped, like a sail in the blast,
And fluttered an audible answer at last.

And it spake, with a shake of the voice, and it said:
By the driven snow-white and th~ living blood-red
Of my bars, and their heaven of stars overhead 
By the symbol conjoined of them all, skyward cast,
As I float from the steeple, or flap at the mast,
Or droop oer the sod where the long grasses nod, 
My name is as old as the glory of God.

EUROPEAN EXPERIENCE WITH TROPICAL COLONIES.

	WRITING of the colonial problem now
confronting the United States, Mr. Ben-
jamin Kidd has said, in his little volume
on the Control of the Tropics: It is
not a question of the relative merits of
any form of government; it is not even
a question of the relative merits of any
race amongst civilized peoples; it is
simply and purely the question of the ul-
timate relation of the white man to the
tropics.
	Mr. Kidd has gone to the heart of
the subject; for whilst it is certain that
all intelligent citizens of the United
States have realized that the war with
Spain has created a new and important
national problem, it is equally certain
that there is a general tendency to un-
derestimate its difficulties and to mis-
judge its real character.
	In setting out to control tropical pos-
sessions the United States has the ex-
perience of six nations to draw upon, 
Spain, Portugal, Germany, France, Hol-
land, and Great Britain. Three of these
may be dismissed at once. Spain and
Portugal may serve as warnings; they
can never serve as examples. Germany
has had an experience of only fourteen
years in tropical colonization, and no
opinion of her methods can be of value
until her work has had the test of a
longer time. If, therefore, the true sys-
tem of controlling tropical colonies has
been discovered, we may expect to find
it in the colonial experience of France,
Holland, or Great Britain.
	France embarked on a policy of co-
lonial expansion from the necessity of
keeping pace with Russia, who is ex-
tending her empire in the Far East, and
with Germany, who hopes to become an
African power; and although colonial
rivalry with England is at present out
of the question, there is a lingering hope
amongst a certain class of French states-
men that the next century will witness a
decrease rather than an augmentation of
Great Britains colonial possessions. Of
the French Asiatic colonies as a whole
it may be said that they consist of a
handful of French merchants and ad-
venturers, a large body of government
officials, and a considerable population
of uneducated and semi-barbarous na-
tives, who are exploited  very unsuc-
cessfully,it i true  for the benefit of the
home government. Mr. Henry Nor-
man, in his Peoples and Politics of the
Far East, has drawn a striking picture
of the methods adopted by France in
her Asiatic colonies. In 1890 the pop-
ulation of French Cochin-China was
1,800,000, of whom only 1600 were
French. Of these 1600, 1200 were
government officials. The salaries of
these officials amounted to $1,750,000,
and in the same year the amount de-
voted to public works was $80,000.
More extraordinaty still, the whole of
this $80,000 was paid out as salaries to
officials of the department, and not a
cents worth of work was done. In re-
gard to Tongking, Mr. Norman calcu-
lates that the French taxpayer has ex-
pended $24,000 a day on the colony for
each day, Sundays included, that it has
been a French possession. Up to the
end of 1892 France had spent 476,000,-
000 francs on Tongking, and as a set-
off to this, during the same period, had
sold the colony 59,000,000 francs worth
of French goods.
	In the West Indies France has been
financially more fortunate, and a con-
siderable trade exists between Marti-
nique and Guadeloupe and the mother
country. But a visit to these islands

unsatisfactory condition. Both in Mar-
tinique and in Guadeloupe the leading
industries are dependent on imported
East Indian laborers. French Guiana,
or Cayenne, is at present merely an in-
significant tract of land on the mainland
of South America, which is used as a
convIct settlement, no serious effort ever
having been made to develop its great
natural resources. It is interesting to
note that Algeria, the most important
colonial possession of France, and the
one which might be most reasonably ex-
pected to prove a financial success, fails
to pay the cost of its administration,
from the necessity of maintaining an
army of 54,000 men to control 3,500,-
000 natives. France has obtained little
honor and less profit from her colonial
ventures. Her ambition has been to
achieve in the tropics what England has
achieved in Australia, New Zealand,
Canada, and her other non-tropical colo-
nies,  the founding of hardy dependen-
cies, populated by a race mainly of the
home stock, and bound to the mother
country by all the ties of affection and
loyalty,  dependencies which in the
hour of need would prove a source of
strength to the nation. The failure of
France is due rather to the fundamental
difficulties of tropical colonization than
to the evil effects of maladministration;
for it is doubtful whether even any of
Englands tropical possessions, loyal as
they undoubtedly are, would prove a
source of strength in time of war.
Frenchmen have not emigrated to the
French colonies, because to most white
men the tropics offer little inducement
as a home. The absence of all those
conveniences and luxuries which form
so large a part of our daily life becomes
unendurable as soon as the novelty of
a strange land has worn off.
	The experience of Holland presents
1 In Rear-Admiral Aubes La Martinique:

Son Pn~,sent et son Avenir occors the follow-
ing passage: The colony is fatally doomed
to decadence, and it is to put things in the very
a series of facts of the highest signifi-
cance in relation to tropical colonization,
and the history of the Dutch colonies
furnishes us with material for the under-
standing of the problem of colonial ad-
ministration.
	The Dutch have tropical colonies both
in the East Indies and in the West In-
dies. In her East Indian colonies Hol-
land has attained a degree of success
which has been reached by no other
nation in similar circumstances; but in
the West Indies her failure has been no
less conspicuous than that of other pow-
ers.
	The principal East Indian possession
of Holland is Java, an island which has
an area of about 49,000 square miles,
with a population of 22,500,000, or, in
other words, 459 persons to the square
mile. The population is made up of
22,000,000 natives, who are Malayans;
300,000 Chinese; 42,000 Europeans,
including half-castes; 14,900 Arabs;
3500 Hindus; the rest are of various
Asiatic and Polynesian races. Ninety-
five per cent of the people are Moham-
medans. When the Dutch occupied the
island at the beginning of the seventeenth
century, they found the people in an ad-
vanced state of civilization, measured by
the standards of the East; and since the
Dutch authority became firmly estab-
lished, they have shown themselves peace-
ful, industrious, and of gentle disposi-
tion. Holland determined to govern
the island as a national plantation, and
instituted a system of forced labor which,
with slight modifications, still exists.
The system cannot fairly be called slav-
ery; for although it is compulsory for
every able-bodied native to devote a cer-
tain portion of his time to the cultivation
of coffee, sugar, and other crops, to be
delivered at the government depots, he
receives in return a fair price for the

best light to suppose that the richest part of
the island will be able for a few years longer
to maintain the degree of prosperity which it
has arrived at.</PB>

insisted on was, in effect, that the natu-
ral tendency of the people to work only
so long as sufficed for the gratification
of their simple needs should not be al-
lowed to interfere with the development
of a country which could be made to
yield a handsome profit to the govern-
ment, and at the same time provide a
comfortable means of support for the
natives. Under this system the island
prospered amazingly. Trade increased
with great rapidity; the government
reaped enormous profits; the people en-
joyed a degree of material prosperity be-
fore undreamed of; gradually the task
of ruling the island became less and
less difficult, and the government has
found it possible to appoint large num-
bers of intelligent natives to those im-
portant and responsible posts which had
to be created, as a result of the commer-
cial expansion arising out of the enforced
industry of the people.
	Let us turn our attention now to Su-
rinam, the principal colony of the Dutch
in the West Indies. Surinam, or Dutch
Guiana, as it is sometimes called, re-
seinbies Java in many respects. It lies
at the same distance to the north of the
equator as Java lies to the south; it is
of almost the same area; it possesses a
similar climate; its soil is suitable for
the cultivation of the same products;
it is watered by noble rivers; it has
enormous forests of valuable timber;
and it has the advantage of Java in be-
ing much nearer to the European mar-
kets. Yet what do we find? Instead
of the thriving population of Java, in-
stead of its immense trade and tranquil
prosperity, we see a country barely able
to keep its head above the wave of bank-
ruptcy which is continually threatening
it; a country of whose area only one
half of one per cent is beneficially occu-
pied; a country where most of the work
is done by laborers imported from the

ber of the council of the Royal Colonial Jasti
East,  where, to quote from Mr. Wash-
ington Eves, the neglected stores where
the European merchants carried on their
business tell a tale of decadence. It
would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to
enumerate all the circunistances which
have combined to place in such striking
contrast two countries so similar in natu-
ral conditions; but two facts stand pro-
minently forth,  the differences in the
nature of the native population and in
the form of government of the two colo-
nies. In Java the population is of Ma-
lays, in Surinam of negroes. The Malays
have shown themselves capable of evolv-
ing a civilization, of combining together
for the purpose of maintaining national
institutions and of carrying out enter-
prises of public utility without assistance
or guidance from the white man. In
character they exhibit those traits which
belong to most Eastern races: a great
reverence for family ties; a tendency to
resist the intrusion of foreign authority,
and a tendency no less marked to sub-
mit quietly to that authority once it is
firmly established; a natural disinclina-
tion to steady work, which, however,
yields readily in the face of reasonable
inducement or slight pressure; a certain
quickness of intellect which gives them
a clear vision where their material inter-
ests are concerned, and saves them from
being improvident; and, finally, a curi-
ous mental adjustment, which, if it be-
comes unsettled through intense excite-
ment or mental strain, is likely to change
them in a moment into savages.
	It is not my purpose to undertake
to describe the negro as he was before
his introduction into the western hemi-
sphere, or as he might have been un-
der different circumstances, but only the
West Indian negro as he is, without re-
ference to the question whether his pre-
sent characteristics are due to ill treat-
ment, to lack of opportunity, or to in-
herent mental and physical qualities.

	The Dutch found the negro undesir-
able as a slave; they have found him
still more undesirable as a free man.
Having developed no civilization of his
own, he cannot adapt himself to an alien
civilization. Exhibiting some outward
indications of adherence to Christianity,
he reverts, as soon as he is left to him-
self, to the disgusting rites which belong
to his gross and abominable supersti-
tions. He will not work, for he has no
ambitions to gratify. For authority, un-
less it be of the rigorous military kind,
he has no respect. His passions are
easily aroused, and he is prone to riot
and insurrection. Finally, there seems
to be no general tendency in the West
Indian negro to improve under the in-
fluence of education and example. The
character of the negro, then, is one rea-
son why Surinam differs so widely from
Java.
	In government Holland has adopted
toward Java an autocratic method, and
under it the people have become pro-
sperous and contented. In Surinamn a
restricted system of representation exists,
and the government has not compelled
the people to work. The result has been
that the negroes have retired into the
forests, and given themselves up to devil
worship, whilst the labor in the colony
is done chiefly by imported East In-
dian laborers. Whatever might have
been the condition of the Surinam ne-
gro. under autocratic government, he
has proved himself, under a more liberal
system, unsatisfactory as a colonist.
	The experience of the Dutch with trop-
ical negroes, however, has been limited,
and the idea naturally suggests itself
that possibly the failure of the Surinam
negro to make a good colonist is due
rather to bad management by his rulers
than to any defect in his own nature.
In order to gain a broader view of the
tropical negro, and to observe him under
the most enlightened form of govern-
ment he has ever enjoyed, a brief glance
at the British West Indian colonies is
necessary. I spent six years, beginning
in 1891, in the West Indies and in Brit-
ish Guiana, and made during that time
a careful study of the conditions prevail-
ing in the West Indian colonies.
	It is convenient to divide the more
important of these colonies into three
classes: the colonies of small industries,
Dominica, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Toba-
go, Antigua, Grenada, St. Kitts, Nevis,
and Montserrat; the colonies of large in-
dustries, Trinidad, British Guiana, and
Jamaica; and Barbados, the economic
conditions of which differ materially
from those of either of the other two
classes. In the year 1896 the colonies
of the first class exported produce of the
total value of $3,240,000: the highest on
the list being Antigua, with $910,000;
the lowest Montserrat, with $120,000.
The colonies of the second class export-
ed produce of the total value of $24,000,-
000: the highest being British Guiana,
with $9,000,000; the lowest Trinidad,
with $6,750,000. It is impracticable
to deal with each of these colonies sepa-
rately, or to point out those distinctions
which undoubtedly exist in their condi-
tions. Taking the colonies of small in-
dustries as a group, we find a most de-
pressing state of affairs. These islands,
which were once thriving and prosper.
ous, are now fast sinking to ruin. Near-
ly all are of extraordinary fertility.
and most of them possess a delightful
climate; yet the land is falling out of
cultivation year by year, and unmistak-
able signs of decay are observable on
every side. The chief cause of this de-
cay, in my judgment, is the nature of
the native population. Except St. Lucia,
none of the islands suffers from a lack
of laborers; but very little labor is re-
quired for the carrying on of the small
industries that still survive. Were any
attempt made to establish large indus-
tries, it would fail unless laborers were
imported from the East.
	In support of this view I turn to the
colonies of large industries. Trinidad</PB>

has a population of 245,000, composed
chiefly of negroes, half-breeds, and East
Indian coolies. The coolies were intro-
duced in order that the agriculture of
the island might not disappear for want
of men to do the work. These coolies
and their descendants now form nearly
one half of the population; and this tes-
timony as to their importance as laborers
is given in the Report of the West India
Royal Commission, which visited the
British West Indian colonies last year:
It has, however, been pressed upon ns,
by evidence which we cannot disregard,
that at the present time, and under pre-
sent conditions, indentured laborers are
absolutely necessary to the carrying on
of the sugar estates. In Jamaica a
similar condition exists. To the ques-
tion, Should the supply of immigrants
be increased, continued, or diminished?
Mr. P. C. Cork, a gentleman who has
had an experience of twenty-three years
in the West Indies, gives the follow-
ing reply: The system should be con-
tinued; otherwise no large agricultural
operations can be conducted with good
prospect of success. . . . A great many
of the most important sugar estates would
have long since had to be abandoned
but for coolie labor. . . . And the ba-
nana industry could not have extended
at anything like the rate it has done
without such aid. 2 In British Gui-
ana the case is even more serious. The
coolies in that colony are fully one half
of the population ; and at least three
quarters of the work done in the colo-
ny is done by East Indians. A planter
of thirty-seven years experience gave the
following reply to the 4uestion, Does
the need exist for further immigration?
Yes, immigration is now as indispen-
sable to the sugar planter as it ever was,
because here in British Guiana the na-
tive laborer is disinclined to work more
than four days a week, and often [he
works] less, perhaps not at all. He is

quite unreliable, and not to be depended
on. ~
	In Trinidad, Jamaica, and British
Guiana East Indian laborers are import-
ed under contract to work on the sugar
estates. The terms of indenture vary
slightly in the different colonies, but are,
in effect, as follows: The indentured la-
borers must work five days a week, and
seven hours a day, for a period of five
years. In return for this, the planter
must furnish him with a free house, free
hospital accommodation on the estate,
free medical attendance and medicine,
and free schooling for his children, and
must pay a minimum legal wage. At
the end of five years the laborer becomes
absolutely free, and can claim a free
grant of land from the government or a
passage back to India.
	The testimony is overwhelming that
in those islands where the labor supply
consists of negroes little work is done
that wherever large industries are to
be found it is the coolie who does
the work. There is one, and only one
exception to this rule,  the island of
Barbados; and the negro is there un-
der absolute compulsion to work. Bar-
bados is unique in several respects.
With an area of 100,000 acres of culti-
vable land, 91,000 acres are under culti-
vation, the rest being used for residen-
tial sites, pasturage, and so on. There
are left no forests or waste lands on
which the negro can squat. The popu-
lation of the island is about 186,000, or
1120 to the square mile. Under these
circumstances it is evident that the Bar-
badian negro has his choice of working
or starving.
	It is significant of the feeling which
prevails at the British Colonial Office in
reference to the fitness of the West In-
dian negro for self-government that the
island of Dominica has recently been
deprived of its system of representation
and converted into a Crown Colony. The

manner in which the change was effect-
ed is most instructive. The Dominican
House of Assembly, which consisted of
elected and nominated members in such
proportion that a solid vote of the elec-
tives would place the government in a
minority, rejected a government motion
to make the island a Crown Colony. The
administrator then dissolved the Assem-
bly and issued writs for new elections.
With the particular issue before them,
the people returned one member whose
views were known to coincide with those
of the government. When the new As-
sembly met, the resolution to make the
island a Crown Colony was carried by
one vote,  that of an elected member
representing the wishes of his constitu-
ents. An amendment was introduced
and lost, which ran: Inasmuch as the
government is trying to deprive the in-
habitants of their just rights and liber-
ties, be it resolved that the British gov-
ernment be asked to barter Dominica
with the French, American, or any other
nation. A local newspaper, comment-
ing on the vote, said: Rather than
counsel submission to such a policy we
advise steadfast and persistent opposi-
tion to the government; and when all
constitutional means shall have been ex-
hausted in vain, then we would hold up
for imitation the resolve of the Cuban
people,  to let the aliens have the coun-
try in ashes, if have it they must; since
it is preferable to be a free man in a
wild country rather than a serf in the
most highly developed and prosperous
community.
	It speaks something for the tolerance
of British rule that such rank sedition
should remain unnoticed by the authori-
ties. The question of representative
government for tropical negroes has been
treated by many writers. James An-
thony Froude, writing on the subject in
1887, said: If the Antilles are ever to
thrive, each of them should have some
trained and skillful man at its head, un-
embarrassed by local elected assemblies.
	Let us persist in the other line;
let us use the West Indian governments
as asylums for average worthy persons
who have to be provided for, and force
on them black parliamentary institutions
as a remedy for such persons inefficien-
cy, and these beautiful countries will be-
come like Hayti, with Obeah triumphant,
and children offered to the devil, and
salted and eaten, till the conscience of
mankind wakes again and the Ameri-
cans sweep them all away.
	To sum up. We find that Holland has
succeeded in Java, where the population
is composed of Malayans, and where
forced labor has been exacted; that she
has failed in Surinam, where the popu-
lation is largely negro, and where no
compulsion has been used; that Eng-
land has failed wherever the population
is composed of negroes, and has attained
a moderate degree of success only where
East Indian laborers form a large pro-
portion of the population, and a contract-
labor system is in force; finally, that
wherever, in those colonies which have
been dealt with in this article, any con-
siderable industries exist, the East In-
dian indentured immigrant is found do-
ing the work.
	Any attempt to govern the tropical
possessions of the United States on de-
mocratic principles is doomed to certain
failure. It has been clearly shown that
without forced labor, or at least some
form of indentured labor, large indus-
tries cannot be developed in tropical col-
onies. Apart from the instances already
cited, this statement is true of Hawaii,
Mauritius, Natal, Queensland, Peru, the
Fiji Islands, the Straits Settlements, and
the Danish West Indies.
	But there is a more serious question.
It is thought by many that although it
may be unadvisable to grant the colonies
representative government at present,
the time will soon come when the people
of these colonies will show themselves
capable of self-government. Judging
from past experience, there would seem</PB>

to be little hope that these pleasant
anticipations will ever be realized. We
look in vain for a single instance within
the tropics of a really well-governed in-
dependent country. Would the United
States tolerate under its flag the condi-
tions which prevail in Venezuela, in
Siam, in Hayti, in the Central American
republics ?
	The system under which this country
might hope to achieve success with her
tropical possessions is one which is little
likely to be adopted. It is the system
advocated by Froude for the island of
Dominica,  surely the most beautiful
of all tropical islands: Find a Rajah
Brooke 1 if you can, or a Mr. Smith of
Scilly. . . . Send him out with no more
instructions than the knight of La Man-
cha gave Sancho,  to fear God and do
his duty. Put him on his metal. Pro-
mise him the praise of all good men if
lie does well; and if he calls to his help
intelligent persons who understand the
cultivation of soils and the management
of men, in half a score years Dominica
would be the brightest gem of the An-
tilles. . . . The leading of the ~vise few,
the willing obedience of the many, is
the beginning and end of all right ac-
tion. Secure this, and you secure every-
thing. Fail to secure it, and, be your
liberties as wide as you can make them,
no success is possible.

OUR GOVERNMENT OF NEWLY ACQUIRED TERRITORY.

	THE acquisition of Porto Rico and
the probable acquisition of the Philip-
pine Islands, or of part of them, have
called attention to our machinery for
governing territories outside the Union.
The United States has already had con-
siderable experience in the government
of territories acquired from foreign pow-
ers. Eight times, by purchase, by con-
quest, or by voluntary cession, it has en-
larged its boundaries. In 1803 Louisi-
ana was purchased from France. In
1819 Florida was obtained from Spain,
and in 1845 Texas was annexed. In
1848 the conquest of Mexico resulted in
the cession of provinces richer than any
that she retained, and in 1853 another
tract of laud was purchased from her.
In 1867 Russia sold us Alaska, and in
1898 Hawaii has been received after the
manner of Texas, while territories the
extent of which is not at this time deter-
niined are exacted of Spain.
	Of these additions, to our territory,

as independent states, both by the United
States and by other goirernments. Tex-
as became at once a member of the
Union. For other annexed territory,
Congress thought it necessary to provide
a form of government not based upon
the principle of local autonomy, and in
which the ultimate control rested in the
hands of the authorities at Washington.
Local circumstances, such as sparsity of
population or the presence of a prepon-
derant foreign element, were the reasons
for keeping these territories in tutelage.
	In making provision for our first ac-
cession of foreign territory, Congress
was guided by the Ordinance for the
government of the territory of the Unit-
ed States northwest of the river Ohio,
 a measure more popularly known as
the Ordinance of 1787. When the gov-
eminent under the Constitution came
into existence, it found the Union in
possession of a vast tract of country
which was not organized into states, but
which was held and administered as the
common property of all the members of</PB>

the Union. As the life of the old Con-
tinental Congress slowiy drew to a close,
it brought to an end its deliberations
upon the disposition of the Northwest,
and enacted the great Ordinance which
has had a profound influence in many
directions. It is usually recalled as the
measure that kept slavery out of the
Northwest; hut it has been no less im-
portant in its influence upon our institu-
tional history, for it was this Ordinance
which served for many years as the
model for the organization of govern-
ment in the territories. The Congress
which was first called upon to deal with
the government of foreign acquisitions
naturally turned to it as a guide. In-
deed, it was used as a guide even before
any annexations were made. In 1790,
when Congress organized into a terri-
tory the area now included in the states
of Kentucky and Tennessee, it provided
that the government of the said terri-
tory south of the Ohio shall be similar
to that which is now exercised in the
territory northwest of the Ohio. Later,
in 1798, the same provision was made
for the government of Mississippi Terri-
tory. And the governments established
in the territories of Indiana, Michigan,
and Illinois, formed by the division of
the old Northwest Territory, were all
copies of the government formulated in
the Ordinance of 1787.
	The government of the Northwest Ter-
ritory was as undemocratic as can well
be imagined. It was divided into two
grades; the first grade to cease when the
territory should contain five thousand
free male inhabitants of full age. While
the territory remained under the first
grade of government, the inhabitants
had absolutely no voice in their political
affairs. rrhe executive power was vest-
ed in a governor, who was appointed by
the President for a term of three years,
and who was assisted by a secretary,
similarly appointed for a term of four
years. The judicial power was vested
in three judges appointed by the Presi
dent to hold office during good behavior.
Besides their judicial functions, the three
judges, with the governor, constituted
the territorial legislature. But here their
power was subject to severe limitations.
Far from possessing a free hand in le-
gislation subject to the supervision of Con-
gress, they were merely empowered to
adopt such statutes of the original states
as they deemed applicable to the local
needs of the territory. As the situation
in the territory was radically different
from that which led to legislation in the
states, it is easy to see that suitable stat-
utes were hard to find. To obviate this
difficulty, the judges resorted to the ex-
pedient of adopting parts of statutes from
several states, and combining them into
a new statute. The governor of the
Northwest, St. Chair, protested against
this practice as being beyond their com-
petence; but, since the territory would
have been without laws had not this
method been adopted, he finally yielded
to the necessities of the situation.
	This state of affairs was relieved some-
what when the territory attained a pop-
ulation of five thousand free male inhab-
itants of full age, for then a legislature
came into existence, one house of which
was elected by the people. At the first
meeting of the elective house it chose ten
persons, whose names were sent to the
President, and from these ten the Presi-
dent appointed five, who constituted the
legislative council, or upper house of the
legislature. The election of the lower
house was the full extent of the peoples
participation in the territorial govern-
ment under the Ordinance of 1787.
	The dread of a strong executive which
had been manifested in the colonies so
many times seems not to have prevailed
when the Ordinance of 1787 was adopt-
ed, for the executive office then created
was almost autocratic in its power. The
governor was made commander-in-chief
of the militia, aU the officers of which
below the grade of general officer were
appointed by him. He also appointed</PB>

all the other territorial officers except
the secretary and the judges. He was
to establish such magistracies and other
civil offices as he thought necessary for
the preservation of order, and he was
empowered to lay out counties and town-
ships in those parts of the country in
which the Indian title had been extin-
guished, and to organize local govern-
ment therein according to his discretion.
He could summon, prorogue, and dis-
solve the legislature, and he had an ab-
solute veto upon its proceedings. When
we add that the incumbent in the office
of governor, General Arthur St. Clair,
was inclined to push his power to the
utmost, it is easy to see why the state of
Ohio, in its first constitution, and in the
later constitution of 1851, which is still
in force, deprived the chief executive of
almost all the usual functions of his
office.
	In the formation of this territorial
government, many of the cardinal po-
litical principles in support of which the
colonies had gone to war with Great
Britain were entirely disregarded. Here
was government without the consent of
the governed. Here was taxation with-
out representation. Here was such a
mingling of the three departments of
government, and such a concentration of
power in the hands of the executive, as
was not to be found in any other part
of the United States. The explanation
is that the authors of the government of
the Northwest were making provision
for the administration of a territory
which might properly be called a colony,
and the principles applied at that time
to the government of colonies were ap-
plied here. The inhabitants were not
consulted about the form of government,
their laws, or the selection of their offi-
cers. Their delegate in Congress, chosen
not by the people, but by the territorial
legislature, could debate, but he had no
vote. He held a position not unlike that
formerly held by the agents maintained
by the colonies in London. Indeed, it

was not unusual to hear the Northwest
referred to as a colony. In 1786 Mon-
roe sent to Jefferson a description of the
government proposed for the Northwest,
and said, It is, in effect, to be a colo-
nial government, similar to that which
prevailed in these states previous to the
Revolution. A few weeks later he
wrote, It hath been proposed and sup-
ported by our state to have a colonial
government established over the western
districts, to cease at the time they shall
be admitted into the Confederacy. This
was the government which was to serve
as a model for the government of territo-
ry newly acquired by the United States.
	Our first annexation of foreign ter-
ritory was the Louisiana purchase, of
which the United States took possession
December 20, 1803. By Article III. of
the treaty of cession, it was stipulated
that the inhabitants of the ceded terri-
tory should be incorporated in the Union,
and admitted as soon as possible, ac-
cording to the principles of the Federal
Constitution, to the enjoyment of all the
rights, advantages, and immunities of
citizens of the United States. Pending
the arrangement of a temporary govern-
ment for the territory, all the military,
civil, and judicial powers exercised by
the old French officers were to be vest-
ed in persons appointed by the President,
and exercised as he might direct. By
virtue of this provision, practically all
the functions of government became vest-
ed for a few months in the hands of one
man, Governor Claiborn, of Mississippi
Territory, who was appointed governor
of Louisiana. Alexander Johnston has
said of this government, It was in ef-
fect a military despotism over Louisiana,
and may suffice as an example of the
extent to which the sovereign power
over the territories might go, if a wiser
policy were not the rule.
	In the following year, 1804, Congress
worked out a plan of government for
the French purchase. The whole area
was divided into two parts by a line</PB>

drawn along the thirty-third parallel,
which is now the northern boundary of
the state of Louisiana. That portion
south of the line was called the territory
of Orleans. All the rest of the area
ceded by France was organized into the
district of Louisiana. In neither of these
divisions did Congress see fit to allow
the people any great share in their gov-
ernment: in one case because the pop-
ulation, though considerable, was almost
exclusively French and Spanish; and in
the other, because there were few civ-
ilized people of any race.
	In the more populous division, the
territory of Orleans, a government mod-
eled after that of the Northwest Terri-
tory, but with some radical differences,
was organized. The constitution of the
executive was the same as in the North-
west, but in the structure of the other
two departments there were noteworthy
changes. Instead of a legislature com-
posed of the governor and judges, the
law-making power was vested in a legis-
lative council composed of thirteen of
the most fit and discreet persons of the
territory, whom the President was to
appoint annually from among those hold-
ing real estate therein. With the con-
sent of a majority of the legislative
council, the governor was empowered
to alter, modify, or repeal any laws
of the territory which were in force
at the time of this territorial organiza-
tion. The law provided that their le-
gislative powers shall also extend to all
rightful subjects of legislation; but no
law shall be valid which is inconsistent
with the Constitution and laws of the
United States, or which shall lay any
person under restraint, burden, or dis-
ability, on account of his religious opin-
ions, professions, or worship ; in all
which he shall be free to maintain his
own, and not burdened for those of an-
other. The governor and council were
further restricted in that they had no
power over the primary disposal of the
soil, nor could they tax the lands of
the United States, or interfere with any
claims to land in the territory. All
legislative acts were of course subject
to the approval of Congress. Instead
of the three judges appointed by the
President, there was to be a superior
court, and such inferior courts and jus-
tices of the peace as the territorial legis-
lature should from time to time estab-
lish. Trial by jury was secured to the
inhabitants in all cases of capital crime,
and they were also guaranteed certain
other legal protections, such as the writ
of habeas corpus, bail for offenses, and
freedom from cruel or unusual punish-
ments. These provisions are of impor-
tance, as an attempt to engraft certain
institutions of the English law upon a
people accustomed to the forms of the
Roman law. The United States was re-
presented in the territory by a district
judge, who was required to reside in the
city of New Orleans, and hold therein
four sessions annually. He was to ex-
ercise the same jurisdiction and powers
as were exercised by the judge of the
Kentucky district. An attorney for the
United States, and a marshal, both of
whom were appointed by the President,
completed the organization of the fed-
eral court.
	The district of Louisiana, which com-
prised all the rest of the French pur-
chase,  an area so vast that ten states
have since been created out of it,  was
placed under the government of the
officers of Indiana Territory. The ex-
ecutive power vested in the governor of
Indiana was extended over the district.
The governor and the judges of Indi-
ana were empowered to establish infe-
rior courts, and to define their jurisdic-
tion. They had also a general legisla-
tive power; but the right of trial by
jury was reserved in all criminal cases,
and in civil cases in which more than
one hundred dollars was involved, and
either of the parties required it. The
Indiana governor and judges had a much
wider legislative power in the district</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00745" SEQ="0745" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="739">Our Government of Newly Acquired Territory.	739

than they had in their own territory.
The laws made by the governor and
judges for the territory had no force in
the district, unless it was expressly so
provided, and likewise those made for
the district had no force in the territory.
	These provisions for the government of
the territory of Orleans and the district
of Louisiana continued in force for
about a year. They were then super-
seded by acts which converted the dis-
trict of Louisiana into the territory of
Louisiana, and established both in that
territory and in the territory of Orleans
a government analogous to the second
grade of government in the Northwest
Territory. They remained thus without
change until the territory of Orleans
was admitted to the Union as the state
of Louisiana in 1812. In the same year
the name of the territory of Louisiana
was changed to Missouri, but the same
form of government was retained until
1816, when provision was made for the
organization of a legislature both houses
of which were elected by the people of
the territory. This change marks the
transition from the colonial state.
	Our next accessioa of territory was
Florida, which was acquired from Spain
by the treaty of February 22, 1819.
Article VI. of this treaty, like Article
III. of the treaty of Paris of 1803, pro-
vided that the inhabitants should be in-
corporated in the Union as soon as might
be consistent with the principles of the
Federal Constitution, and admitted to all
the rights and immunities of citizens of
the United States. There was a delay
of two years between the signing of the
treaty and the exchange of ratifications,
and more than another year elapsed be-
fore Congress provided a government
for the Spanish cession. The territorial
government of Florida was fashioned
after that of the territory of Orleans.
Here again we find an executive depart-
ment consisting of a governor and a
secretary appointed by the President,
while the legislative power was vested in
the governor and in thirteen of the
most fit and discreet persons of the ter-
ritory, who were to be appointed by
the President from among the citizens
of the United States residing in Flori-
da. The ownership of real estate in the
territory, which was made a requisite for
membership in the legislature of Orleans,
was not required for appointment to the
legislature of Florida. The judicial
organization of Florida was almost an
exact copy of that of Orleans.
	The next extension of our boundaries
was by the admission of Texas, which
was annexed to the United States and
admitted to the Union by the same act.
In consequence of this arrangement it
was never governed as a territory. The
war in which the United States was in-
volved because of this annexation re-
sulted in the acquisition of Upper Cal-
ifornia and New Mexico. In the case of
California, the debates in Congress on
the Wilmot Proviso delayed so long the
organization of a territorial government
to supplant the military government es-
tablished during the war with Mexico,
that the discovery of gold and the con-
sequent immigration made a state gov-
ernment necessary at once. This the
people proceeded to form without any
authorization from Congress; and when
formed it was accepted by Congress, and
the state was admitted to the Union Sep-
tember 9, 1850. By the same act New
Mexico was endowed with a territorial
organization more liberal than any yet
accorded to newly acquired provinces.
Its government comprised the usual gov-
ernor and secretary appointed by the
President. The legislature, however,
consisted of two houses, both of which
were elected by the people of the terri-
tory; but the federal government kept
a check upon it by giving the governor
an absolute veto. The qualifications for
voting at the first election were very lib-
eral, every free white male citizen of full
age residing in the territory being a duly
qualified elector. After the first elec</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00746" SEQ="0746" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="740">740	Our Government of Newly Acquired Territory.

tion, the territorial legislature was em-
powered to fix the qualifications for suf-
frage. When the Gadsden purchase
was added to the United States in 1853,
it was incorporated in the territory of
New Mexico, which then included an
area greater in extent than the whole of
the present German Empire.
	In 1867 Mr. Seward effected the
purchase of Alaska. Unlike our other
annexations, Alaska offered little or no
prospect of ever becoming fit for ad-
mission to the Union on an equal foot-
ing with the states. It must remain
in a colonial condition for an indefinite
length of time. Owing to the character
and situation of its inhabitants, self-gov-
ernment was out of the question, and
government of any kind was almost im-
possible. Until 1884 Congress took no
action with reference to the matter, but
in that year a civil organization of the
most rudimentary description was estab-
lished. Alaska was made a civil and
judicial district, and the President was
authorized to appoint a governor there
in.	A district court and four commis-
sioners who exercise the powers of jus-
tices of the peace according to the laws
of Oregon complete the government. In
the absence of all legislative authority,
the laws of Oregon, in so far as they are
applicable and not in conflict with the
laws of the United States, are extended
over the district.
	The joint resolution for the annexa-
tion of Hawaii, which received the ap-
proval of the President July 7, 1898,
contains some provisions regarding the
temporary government of the islands
quite similar to the articles of the treaty
of Paris relating to the government of
Louisiana. Until Congress shall other-
wise direct, all the civil, judicial, and
military powers exercised by the officers
of the Hawaiian Republic shall be vest-
ed in such person or persons as the Pre-
sident may appoint, and exercised in
such manner as he may direct. Such
municipal legislation as does not conflict
with its new relations nor with the Con-
stitution or laws of the United States is
to remain in force until altered by Con-
gress. With a view to future legislation
regarding the islands, the President was
directed to appoint a commission of five,
at least two of whom should be residents
of Hawaii, who should recommend to
Congress such measures as seemed ne-
cessary and proper. This commission
has studied the problem on the spot, and
will lay before Congress a plan for the
government of the islands.
	From the foregoing recital of facts it
is possible to draw certain general con-
clusions. First it is to be noted that all
the lands hitherto annexed by the United
States were sparsely populated, or else
the population was predominantly Amer-
ican. The inhabitants of Louisiana and
California were very few as compared
with the vast extent of territory. In
Texas the American element predomi-
nated, while Florida and Alaska had
few people of any race. It is this charac-
teristic of our former annexations  that
they consisted chiefly of vacant lands
 which has made them so important
to the United States. They contained
few persons who had to unlearn old hab-
its and be trained in new political ideas.
They offered an outlet to immigration
from the older states and from Europe.
Since the pioneers in almost all the new
states have been largely of native Amer-
ican stock, they have been a leaven in
the European immigration which fol-
lowed them, and the two elements acting
together have built up communities ca-
pable of taking a place in the sisterhood
of self-governing states.
	With the exception of Alaska, all the
territorial governments hitherto organ-
ized have been avowedly of a temporary
character. Their object has been to
provide a government which would be
sufficient for the needs of a sparse pop-
ulation, and which would at the same
time encourage the development of the
territory into a state. Admission to the</PB>

Union was the goal from the beginning.
The territorial status was merely one of
transition. Indeed, in the case of two
of our most important annexations,
Louisiana and Florida, it was stipulated
in the treaties of cession that the ceded
areas should be admitted to the Union
as soon as was consistent with the prin-
ciples of the Federal Constitution. This
characteristic of our territorial system
is not found in the colonial policy of any
other nation.
	If now we attempt to apply these gen-
eral conclusions to our acquisitions in
the West Indies and the Pacific, we are
at once impressed with differences which
must influence our governmental policy
in dealing with them; for these islands
differ radically from any territory hith-
erto annexed. Instead of vast areas
with a comparatively small population,
and offering tempting fields for settle-
ment, we have in Porto Rico an island
situated in the tropics, with an area one
third less than that of the state of
Connecticut, and a population one third
greater,  a population, moreover, un-
like that of the United States in lan-
guage, laws, aiid political experience and
ideas. In the Philippines a similar situ-
ation exists, except that the contrast is
even greater. The United States has thus
far dealt with problems of government
in connection with the negro, with the
Indian, and with numerous branches of
the Caucasian race. In the Philippines
it will meet with a race radically differ-
ent from any of these, one which has
shown considerable ability in resisting
the established order, and, what is of
greatest importance, one which shows
little inclination to submit to the authori-
ty of the United States. The problem
is further complicated by the existence
of a rival government, to which a con-
siderable number of the natives have
given their allegiance.
	To these conditions none of the forms
of colonial government heretofore estab-
lished in the United States seems to be
applicable, except perhaps the autocratic
government of Louisiana in 1804, and
the military government which prevailed
in California while Congress was debating
what should be done with that province.
Our problem, therefore, is to develop a
new form to meet the peculiar necessi-
ties of the case. It is probably safe to
start with the general proposition that
such territories as Porto Rico and the
Philippines will have to be actively gov-
erned by the authorities at Washington.
The degree of local self-control that can
safely be granted must be exceedingly
small, at least for many years; for the
growth of any considerable American
population in either place will be a very
slow process. Commerce, it is true, is
a strong potential influence, but in the
case of well-established populations its
effects are seen only after the lapse of a
long time. English and Dutch experi-
ence with Asiatics has shown that only
the constant presence of European gar-
risons is sufficient to insure safety and
good order.
	In the second place, whatever form of
government is adopted for our new pos-
sessions must have a degree of perma-
nence not found in our territorial organi-
zations. Porto Rico, for example, will
not be ready for admission to the Union
for many years, if it will ever be. A
more permanent form of rule in this case
must necessarily mean a permanent civil
service. The government of colonies is
not an art to be learned in a day. Our
lack of experience must be cured by
years of practice, in which we shall make
costly mistakes, but as a result of which
a body of men will emerge capable of
handling the problems intrusted to them.
And these men must constitute a per-
manent staff both for administration and
for the training of other men to succeed
them. We may expect from these acces-
sions of territory an indirect gain more
important than any commercial or polit-
ical advantages that may accrue to us.

it is part of our splendor to ignore the
ceremonies as we do the expenses. We
have all the decent grades of riches and
poverty in our colony, but our informal-
ity is not more the treasure of the hum-
ble than of the great. In the nature of
things it cannot last, however, and the
only question is how long it will last. I
think, myself, until some one imagines
giving an eight oclock dinner; then all
the informalities will go, and the whole
train of evils which such a dinner con-
notes will rush in.

IT.

	The cottages themselves are of sev-
eral sorts, and some still exist in the
earlier stages of mutation from the fish-
ermens and farmers houses which
formed their germ. But these are now
mostly let as lodgings to bachelors and
other single or semi-detached folks who
go for their meals to the neighboring
hotels or boarding-houses. The hotels
are each the centre of this sort of centri-
petal life, as well as the homes of their
own scores or hundreds of inmates. A
single boarding-house gathers about it
half a dozen dependent cottages which it
cares for, and feeds at its table; and
even where the cottages have kitchens
and all the housekeeping facilities, their
inmates sometimes prefer to dine at the
hotels. By far the greater number of
cottagers, however, keep house, bringing
their service with them from the cities,
and settling in their summer homes for
three or four or five months.
	The houses conform more or less to
one type: a picturesque structure of co-
lonial pattern, shingled to the ground,
and stained or left to take a weather-
stain of grayish brown, with cavernous
verandas, and dormer - windowed roofs
covering ten or twelve rooms. Within
they are, if not elaborately finished, elab-
orately fitted up, with a constant regard
to health in the plumbing and drainage.
The water is brought in a system of pipes
from a lake five miles away, and as it is
only for summer use the pipes are not
buried from the frost, but wander along
the surface, through the ferns and bram-
bles of the tough little seaside knolls on
which the cottages are perched, and climb
the old tumbling stone walls of the origi-
nal pastures before diving into the ce-
mented basements.
	Perhaps half of the cottages are
owned by their occupants, and furnished
by them; the rest, not less attractive
and hardly less tastefully furnished, be-
long to natives, who have caught on to
the architectural and domestic prefer-
ences of the summer people, and have
built them to let. The rugosities of
the stony pasture land end in a wooded
point seaward, and curve east and north
in a succession of beaches. It is on the
point, and mainly short of its wooded ex-
tremity, that the cottages of our settle-
ment are dropped, as near the ocean as
may be, and with as little order as birds
nests in the grass, among the sweet-fern,
laurel, bay, wild raspberries, and dog-
roses, which it is the ideal to leave as un-
touched as possible. Wheelworn lanes
that twist about among the hollows find
the cottages from the highway, but foot-
paths approach one cottage from another,
and people walk rather than drive to each
others doors.
	From the deep-bosomed, well-sheltered
little harbor the tides swim inland, half
a score of winding miles, up the channel
of a river which without them would be a
trickling rivulet. An irregular line of
cottages follows the shore a little way,
and then leaves the river to the schoon-
ers and barges which navigate it as far
as the oldest pile-built wooden bridge in
New England, and these in their turn
abandon it to the fleets of rowboats and
canoes in which summer youth of both
sexes explore it to its source over depths
as clear as glass, past wooded headlands
and low rush-bordered meadows, through
reaches and openings of pastoral fields,
and under the shadow of dreaming
groves.</PB>

III.

	If there is anything lovelier than the
scenery of this gentle river I do not
know it; and I doubt if the sky is purer
and bluer in paradise. This seems to
be the consensus, tacit or explicit, of the
youth who visit it, and employ the land-
scape for their picnics and their water
parties from the beginning to the end of
summer.
	The river is very much used for sun-
sets by the cottagers who live on it, and
who claim a superiority through them
to the cottagers on the point. An im-
partial mind obliges me to say that the
sunsets are all good in our colony; there
is no place from which they are bad;
and yet for a certain tragical sunset,
where the dying day bleeds slowly into
the channel till it is filled from shore to
shore with red as far as the eye can
reach, the river is unmatched.
	For my own purposes, it is not less
acceptable, however, when the fog has
come in from the sea like a visible re-
verie, and blurred the whole valley with
its whiteness. I find that particularly
good to look at from the trolley car
which visits and revisits the river before
finally leaving it, with a sort of despera-
tion, and hiding its passion with a sudden
plunge into the woods.

Iv.

	The old fishing and seafaring village,
which has now almost lost the recollection
of its first estate in its absorption with
the care of the summer colony, was
sparsely dropped along the highway bor-
dering the harbor, and the shores of the
river, where the piles of the time-worn
wharves are still rotting. A few houses
of the past remain, but the type of the
summer cottage has impressed itself
upon all the later building, and the na-
tive is passing architecturally, if not per-
sonally, into abeyance. He takes the sit-
uation philosophically, and in the season
he caters to the summer colony not only
as the landlord of the rented cottages, and
the keeper of the hotels and boarding-
houses, but as livery-stableman, grocer,
butcher, marketman, apothecary, and
doctor; there is not one foreign accent
in any of these callings. If the native
is a farmer, he devotes himself to vege-
tables, poultry, eggs, and fruit for the
summer folks, and brings these supplies
to their doors; his children appear with
flowers; and there are many proofs that
he has accurately sized the cottagers up
in their tastes and fancies as well as their
needs. I doubt if we have sized him up
so well, or if our somewhat conventional-
ized ideal of him is perfectly representa-
tive. He is perhaps more complex than
he seems; he is certainly much more self-
sufficing than might have been expected.
The summer folks are the material from
which his prosperity is wrought, but he is
not dependent, and is very far from sub-
missive. As in all right conditions, it is
here the employer who asks for work,
not the employee; and the work must be
respectfully asked for. There are many
fables to this effect, as for instance that
of the lady who said to a summer visitor
critical of the weeks wash she had
brought home, I 11 wash you and I 11
iron you, but I wont take none of your
jaw. A primitive independence is the
keynote of the native character, and it
suffers no infringement, but rather boasts
itself. We re independent here, I tell
you, said the friendly person who con-
sented to take off the wire door. I was
down Bangor way doin a piece of work,
and a fellow come along, and says he,
I want you should hurry up on that
job. Hello!  says I, I guess I 11
pull out. Well, we calculate to do our
work, he added, with an accent which
sufficiently implied that their consciences
needed no bossing in the performance.
	The native compliance with any sum-
mer-visiting request is commonly in some
such form as, Well, I dont know but
what I can, or, I guess there aint any-
thing to hinder me. This compliance</PB>

is so rarely, if ever, carried to the point
of domestic service that it may fairly be
said that all the domestic service, at least
of the cottagers, is imported. The na-
tives will wait at the hotel tables; they
will come in to accommodate; but
they will not live out. I was one day
witness of the extreme failure of a friend
whose city cook had suddenly abandoned
him, and who applied to a friendly farm-
ers wife in the vain hope that she might
help him to some one who would help his
family out in their strait. Why, there
aint a girl in the Hollow that lives out!
Why, if you was sick abed, I dont know
as I know anybody t you could git to set
up with you. The natives will not live
out because they cannot keep their self-
respect in the conditions of domestic ser-
vice. Some people laugh at this self-re-
spect, but most summer folks like it, as
I own I do.
	In our partly mythical estimate of the
nitive and his relation to us, he is im-
agined as holding a kind of carnival
when we leave him at the end of the
season, and it is believed that he likes
us to go early. We have had his good
offices at a fair price all summer, but as
it draws to a close these are rendered
more and more fitfully. From some
perhaps flattered reports of the happi-
ness of the natives at the departure of
the sojourners, I have pictured them
dancing a sort of farandole, and stretch-
ing with linked hands from the farthest
summer cottage up the river to the last
on the wooded point. It is certain that
they get tired, and I could not blame
them if they were glad to be rid of their
guests, and to go back to their own social
life. This includes church festivals of
divers kinds, lectures and shows, sleigh-
rides, theatricals, and reading-clubs, and
a plentiful use of books from the excel-
lently chosen free village library. They
say frankly that the summer folks have
no idea how pleasant it is when they are
gone, and I am sure that the gayeties to
which we leave them must be more toler
able than those which we go back to in
the city. It may be, however, that I am
too confident, and that their gayeties are
only different. I should really like to
know just what the entertainments are
which are given in a building devoted to
them in a country neighborhood three or
four miles from the village. It was once
a church, but is now used solely for social
amusements.
V.

	The amusements of the summer colo-
ny I have already hinted at. Besides
suppers, there are also teas, of larger
scope, both afternoon and evening.
There are hops every week at the two
largest hotels, which are practically free
to all; and the bathing-beach is of course
a supreme attraction. The bath-houses,
which are very clean and well equipped,
are not very cheap, either for the season
or for a single bath, and there is a pretty
pavilion at the edge of the sands. This
is always full of gossiping spectators of
the hardy adventurers who brave tides
too remote from the Gulf Stream to be
ever much warmer than sixty or sixty-five
degrees. The bathers are mostly young
people, who have the courage of their
pretty bathing-costumes or the inextin-
guishable ardor of their years. If it is
not rather serious business with them all,
still I admire the fortitude with which
some of them remain in fifteen minutes.
	Beyond our colony, which calls itself
the Port, there is a far more populous
watering-place, east of the Point, known
as the Beach, which is the resort of peo-
ple several grades of gentility lower than
ours: so many, in fact, that we never
can speak of the Beach without averting
our faces, or, at the best, with a toler-
ant smile. It is really a succession of
beaches, all much longer and, I am bound
to say, more beautiful than ours, lined
with rows of the humbler sort of sum-
mer cottages known as shells, and with
many hotels of corresponding degree.
The cottages may be hired by the week
or mouth at about two dollars a day, and</PB>

they are supposed to be taken by inland
people of little social importance. Very
Jikely this is true; but they seemed to
be very nice, quiet people, and I com-
monly saw the ladies reading on their ve-
randas, books and magazines, while the
gentlemen sprayed the dusty road before
them with the garden hose. The place
had also for me an agreeable alien sug-
gestion, and in passing the long row of
cottages I was slightly reminded of Sche-
veningen.
	Beyond the cottage settlements is a
struggling little park, laid out this sea-
son, and dedicated to the only Indian
saint I ever heard of, though there may
be others. His statue, colossal in sheet-
lead, painted the copper color of his race,
offers any heathen comer the choice be-
tween a Bible in one of his hands and a
tomahawk in the other, at the entrance of
the park; and there are other sheet-lead
groups and figures in the white of allegory
at different points. It promises to be a
pretty enough little place in future years,
but as yet it is not much resorted to by
the excursions which largely form the
prosperity of the Beach. The trolley
line was to have been carried as far as
the park, but a want of juice, as the
electric current is familiarly and affec-
tionately called in the trolleymens par-
lance, forbade the extension, and the en-
tertainments of the park have languished.
The concerts and the high-class vaude-
ville promised have not flourished in
the pavilion provided for them, and one
of two monkeys in the zoiilogical depart-
ment has perished of the public inatten-
tion. This has not fatally affected the
captive bear, who rises to his hind legs,
and eats peanuts and doughnuts in that
position like a fellow citizen. With the
cockatoos and parrots, and the dozen deer
in an inclosure of wire netting, he is no
mean attraction; but he does not charm
the excursionists away from the summer
village at the shore, where they spend long
afternoons splashing among the waves,
or in lolling groups of men, women, and
children on the sand. In the more active
gayeties, I have seen nothing so decided
during the whole season as the behavior
of three young girls who once came up
out of the sea, and obliged me by dan-
cing a measure on the smooth hard beach
in their bathing-dresses.

XTI.

	I thought it very pretty, but I do not
believe such a thing could have been seen
on our beach, which is safe from all ex-
cursionists, and sacred to the cottage and
hotel life of the Port.
	Besides our beach and its bathing,
we have a reading-club for the men,
evolved from one of the old native
houses, and verandaed round for sum-
mer use; and we have golf-links and a
golf club-house within easy trolley reach.
The links are as energetically, if not as
generally frequented as the sands, and
the sport finds the favor which attends
it everywhere in the decay of tennis.
The tennis courts which I saw thronged
about by eager girl-crowds, here, seven
years ago, are now almost wholly aban-
doned to the lovers of the game, who
are nearly always men.
	Perhaps the only thing (beside, of
course, our common mortality) which we
have in common with the excursionists
is our love of the trolley line. This, by
its admirable equipment, and by the ter-
ror it inspires in horses, has wellnigh
abolished driving; and following the old
country roads, as it does, with an occa-
sional short-cut through the deep, green-
lighted woods or across the prismatic salt
meadows, it is of a picturesque variety
entirely satisfying. After a year of fer-
vent opposition and protest, the whole
community  whether of summer or of
winter folks  now gladly accepts the
trolley, and the grandest cottager and
the lowliest hotel - dweller meet in a
grateful appreciation of its beauty and
comfort.
	Some pass a great part of every after-
noon on the trolley, and one lady has</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00753" SEQ="0753" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="747">	Confessions of a Summer Colonist.	747

achieved celebrity by spending four dol-
lars a week in trolley rides. The exhil-
aration of these is varied with an occa-
sional apprehension when the car pitches
down a sharp incline, and twists almost
at right angles on a sudden curve at the
bottom without slacking its speed. A
lady who ventured an appeal to the con-
ductor at one such crisis was reassured,
and at the same time taught her place,
by his reply: That motormans life,
maam, is just as precious to him as what
yours is to you.
	She had, perhaps, really ventured too
far, for ordinarily the employees of the
trolley do not find occasion to use so much
severity with their passengers. They
look after their comfort as far as possi-
ble, and seek even to anticipate their
wants in unexpected cases, if I may be-
lieve a story which was told by a wit-
ness. She had long expected to see
some one thrown out of the open car at
one of the sharp curves, and one day she
actually saw a woman hurled from the
seat into the road. Luckily the woman
alighted on her feet, and stood looking
round in a daze.
	Oh! oh!  exclaimed another woman
in the seat behind, she s left her um-
brella!
	The conductor promptly threw it out
to her.
	Why, demanded the witness, did
that lady wish to get out here?
	The conductor hesitated before he
jerked the bell-pull to go on. Then he
said, Well, she 11 want her umbrella,
anyway.
	The conductors are in fact very civil
as well as kind. If they see a horse in
anxiety at the approach of the car, they
considerately stop, and let him get by
with his driver in safety. By such
means, with their frequeiat trips and low
fares, and with the ease and comfort of
their cars, they have conciliated public
favor, and the trolley has drawn travel
away from the steam railroad in such
measure that it ran no trains last winter.
VII.

	The trolley, in fact, is a fad of the
summer folks, this year; but what it
will be another no one knows; it may
be their hissing and by-word. In the
meantime, as I have already suggested,
they have other amusements. These
are not always of a nature so general as
the trolley, or so particular as the tea.
But each of the larger hotels has been
fully supplied with entertainments for
the benefit of their projectors, though
nearly everything of the sort had some
sort of charitable slant. I assisted at a
stereopticon lecture on Alaska for the
aid of some youthful Alaskans of both
sexes, who were shown first in their sav-
age state, and then as they appeared
after a merely rudimental education, in
the costumes and profiles of our own
civilization. I never would have sup-
posed that education could do so much
in so short a time; and I gladly gave
my mite for their further development
in classic beauty and a final elegance.
My mite was taken up in a hat, which,
passed round among the audience, is a
common means of collecting the spec-
tators expressions of appreciation. Oth-
er entertainments, of a prouder frame,
exact an admission fee, but I am not sure
that these are better than some of the
hat-shows, as they are called.
	The tale of our summer amusements
would be sadly incomplete without some
record of the bull-fights given by the
Spanish prisoners of war on the neigh-
boring island, where they have been
confined. Admission to these could be
had only by favor of the officers in
charge, and even among the 6lite of the
colony those who went were a more elect
few. Still, the day I went, there were
some fifty or seventy - five spectators,
who arrived by trolley near the island,
and walked to the stockade which con-
fined the captives. A real bull-fight, I
believe, is always given on Sunday, and
Puritan prejudice yielded to usage even</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00754" SEQ="0754" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="748">	748	Confessions of a Summer Colonist.

in the case of a burlesque bull-fight; at
any rate, it was on a Sunday that we
crouched in an irregular semicircle on
a rising ground within the prison pale,
and faced the captive audience in an-
other semicircle, across a little alley for
the entrances and exits of the perform-
ers. The president of the bull-fight was
first brought to the place of honor in a
hand-cart, and then came the banderille-
ros, the picadores, and the espada, won-
derfully effective and correct in white
muslin and colored tissue-paper. Much
may be done in personal decoration with
advertising placards; and the lofty mu-
ral crown of the president counseled the
public on both sides to Use Plug Cut.
The picadors pasteboard horse was at-
tached to his middle, fore and aft, and
looked quite the sort of hapless jade
which is ordinarily sacrificed to the
bulls. The toro himself was composed
of two prisoners, whose horizontal backs
were covered with a brown blanket;
and his feet, sometimes bare and some-
times shod with india-rubber boots, were
of the human pattern. Practicable horns,
of a somewhat too yielding substance,
branched from a front of pasteboard,
and a cloth tail, apt to come off in the
charge, swung from his rear. I have
never seen a genuine corrida, but a lady
present, who had, told me that this was
conducted with all the right circum-
stance; and it is certain that the per-
formers entered into their parts with the
artistic gust of their race. The picador
sustained some terrific falls, and in his
quality of horse bad to be taken out re-
peatedly and sewed up; the banderilleros
tormented and eluded the toro with table-
covers, one red and two drab, till the
espada took him from them, and with
due ceremony, after a speech to the pre-
sident, drove his blade home to the bulls
heart. I stayed to see three bulls killed;
the last was uncommonly fierce, and
when his hindquarters came off or out,
his forequarters charged joyously among
the aficionados on the prisoners side,
and made havoc in their thickly packed
ranks. The espada who killed this bull
was showered with cigars and cigarettes
from our side.
	I do not know what the Sabbath-
keeping shades of the old Puritans made
of our presence at such a fete on Sun-
day; but possibly they had got on so
far in a better life as to be less shocked
at the decay of piety among us than
pleased at the rise of such Christianity
as had brought us, like friends and com-
rades, together with our public enemies
in this harmless fun. I wish to say that
the tobacco lavished upon the espada was
collected for the behoof of all the pri-
soners.
VIII.

	Our fiction has made so much of our
summer places as the mise en sc?~ne of
its love stories that I suppose I ought to
say something of this side of our colonial
life. But after sixty I suspect that ones
eyes are poor for that sort of thing, and
I can only say that in its earliest and sim-
plest epoch the Port was particularly fa-
mous for the good times that the young
people had. They still have good times,
though whether on just the old terms I
do not know. I know that the river is
still here with its canoes and rowboats,
its meadowy reaches apt for dual soli-
tude, and its groves for picnics. There
is not much bicycling,  the roads are
rough and hilly; but there is something
of it, and it is mighty pretty to see the
youth of both sexes bicycling with their
heads bare. They go about bareheaded
on foot and in buggies, too, and the
young girls seek the tan which their mo-
thers used so anxiously to shun.
	The sailboats, manned by weather-
worn and weather-wise skippers, are
~rather for the pleasure of such older
summer folks as have a taste for cod-
fishing, which is here very good. But
at every age, and in whatever sort our
colonists amuse themselves, it is with
the least possible ceremony. It is as if
Nature having taken them so hospitably</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00755" SEQ="0755" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="749">	Confessions of a Summer Colonist.	749

to her heart, they felt convention an
affront to her. Around their cottages,
as I have said, they prefer to leave her
primitive beauty untouched, and she re-
wards their forbearance with such a
profusion of wild flowers as I have seen
nowhere else. The low pink laurel
flushed all the stony fields to the edges
of their verandas, when we first came;
the meadows were milk-white with dai-
sies; in the swampy places delicate or-
chids grew, in the pools the flags and
flowering rushes; all the paths and way-
sides were set with dog-roses; the hol-
lows and stony tops were broadly matted
with ground juniper. Since then tbe
goldenrod has passed from glory to
glory; first mixing its yellow-powdered
plumes with the red-purple tufts of the
iron-weed, and then with the wild asters
everywhere. There has come later a
dwarf sort, six or ten inches high, won-
derfully rich and fine, which, with a low
white aster, seems to hold the field
against everything else, though the taller
goldenrod and the masses of the high
blue asters nod less thickly above it.
But these smaller blooms deck the ground
in incredible profusion, and have an in-
nocent air of being stuck in, as if they
had been fancifully used for ornament
by children or Indians.

Ix.

	In a little while, now, as it is almost
the end of September, all the feathery
gold will have faded to the soft pale
ghosts of that loveliness. The summer
birds have long been silent; the crows,
as if they were so many exultant natives,
are shouting in the blue sky above the
windrows of the rowan, in jubilant pre-
science of the depopulation of our colony,
which fled the hotels a fortnight ago.
The days are growing shorter, and the
red evenings falling earlier; so that the
cottagers husbands who come up every
Saturday from town might well be im-
patient for a Monday of final return.
Those who came from remoter distances
have gone back already; and the lady
cottagers lingering hardily on till Octo-
ber must find the sight of the empty ho-
tels and the windows of the neighboring
houses, which no longer brighten after
the chilly nightfall, rather depressing.
Every one says that this is the loveliest
time of year, and that it will be divine
here all through October. But there are
sudden and unexpected defections; there
is a steady pull of the heart cityward,
which it is hard to resist. The first great
exodus was on the first of the month,
when the hotels were deserted by four
fifths of their guests. The rest followed,
half of them within the week, and within
a fortnight none but an all but inaudi-
ble and invisible remnant were left, who
made no impression of summer sojourn
in the deserted trolleys.
	The days now go by in moods of rapid
succession. There have been days when
the sea has lain smiling in placid derision
of the recreants who have fled the lin-
gering summer; there have been nights
when the winds have roared round the
cottages in wild menace of the faithful
few who have remained.
	We have had a magnificent storm,
which came, as an equinoctial storm
should, exactly at the equinox, and for a
day and a night heaped the sea upon the
shore in thundering surges twenty and
thirty feet high. I watched these at
their awfulest, from the wide windows of
a cottage that crouched in the very edge
of the surf, with the effect of clutching
the rocks with one hand and holding its
roof on with the other. The sea was such
a sight as I have not seen on shipboard,
and while I luxuriously shuddered at it,
I had the advantage of a mellow log-fire
at my back, purring and softly crackling
in a quiet indifference to the storm.
	Twenty-four hours more made all se-
rene again. Blood-curdling tales of lob-
ster - pots carried to sea filled the air;
but the air was as blandly unconscious of
ever having been a fury as a lady who
has found her lost temper. Swift alter-</PB>

nations of weather are so characteristic
of our colonial climate that the other
afternoon I went out with my umbrella
against the raw cold rain of the morn-
ing, and had to raise it against the broil-
ing sun. Three days ago I could say
that the green of the woods had no touch
of hectic in it; but already the low trees
of the swampland have flamed into crim-
son. Every morning, when I look out,
this crimson is of a fierier intensity, and
the trees on the distant uplands are be-
ginning slowly to kindle, with a sort of
inner glow which has not yet burst into
a blaze. Here and there the goldenrod
is rusting; but there seem only to be
more and more asters of all sorts; and
I have seen ladies coming home with
sheaves of blue gentians; I have heard
that the orchids are beginning again to
light their tender lamps from the burn-
ing blackberry vines that stray from the
pastures to the edge of the swamps.
	After an apparently total evanescence
there has been a like resuscitation of the
spirit of summer society. In the very
last week of September we have gone to
a supper, which lingered far out of its
season like one of these late flowers, and
there has been an afternoon tea which
assembled an astonishing number of cot-
tagers, all secretly surprised to find one
another still here, and professing openly
a pity tinged with contempt for those who
are here no longer.
	I blamed those who had gone home,
but I myself sniff the asphalt afar; the
roar of the street calls to me with the
magic that the voice of the sea is losing.
Just 110W it shines entreatingly, it shines
winningly, in the sun which is mellowing
to an October tenderness, and it shines
under a moon of perfect orb, which seems
to have the whole heavens to itself in
the first watch of the night, except
for the red planet Mars. This be-
gins to burn in the west before the flush
of sunset has passed from it; and then
later, a few moon-washed stars pierce the
vast vault with their keen points. The
stars which so powdered the summer sky
seem mostly to have gone back to town,
where no doubt people mistake them for
electric lights.

AMONG THE BIRDS OF THE YOSEMITE.

	TRAVELERS in the Sierra forests usu-
ally complain of the want of life. The
trees, they say, are fine, but the empty
stillness is deadly; there are no animals
to be seen, no birds. We have not heard
a song in all the woods. And no won-

mules and horses; they make a great
noise; they are dressed in outlandish,
unnatural colors: every animal shuns
them. Even the frightened pines would
run away if they could. But Nature

inhabitants in these mountain mansions,

handsome, independent bird, able with
comfort to bid defiance to beat, cold,
drought, hunger, and all sorts of storms,
living on whatever seeds or insects chance
to come in its way, or simply on the leaves
of sage-brush, everywhere abundant on
its desert range. In winter, when the
temperature is oftentimes below zero,
and heavy snowstorms are blowing, he
sits beneath a sage bush and allows him-

the leaves of his shelter. Not even the
Arctic ptarmigan is hardier in braving
frost and snow and wintry darkness.

bird, with along, firm, sharp-pointed tail,
which in walking is slightly raised and

with black and white on the neck, back,
and wings, weighs five or six pounds, and
measures about thirty inches in length.
The female is clad mostly in plain brown,
and is not so large. They occasionally
wander from the sage plains into the open
nut - pine and juniper woods, but never
enter the main coniferous forest. It is
only in the broad, dry, half-desert sage
plains that they are quite at home, where
the weather is blazing hot in summer, cold
in winter. If any one passes through a
flock, all squat on the gray ground and
hold their heads low, hoping to escape

AMONG THE BIRDS OF THE YOSEMITE.

	TRAVELERS in the Sierra forests usu-
ally complain of the want of life. The
trees, they say, are fine, but the empty
stillness is deadly; there are no animals
to be seen, no birds. We have not heard
a song in all the woods. And no won-
der! They go in large parties with
mules and horses; they make a great
noise; they are dressed in outlandish,
unnatural colors: every animal shuns
them. Even the frightened pines would
run away if they could. But Nature
lovers, devout, silent, open-eyed, looking
and listening with love, find no lack of
inhabitants in these mountain mansions,
and they come to them gladly. Not to
mention the large animals or the small in-
sect people, every waterfall has its ouzel
and every tree its squirrel or tamias or
bird: tiny nuthatch threading the furrows
of the bark, cheerily whispering to itself
as it deftly pries off loose scales and ex-
amines the curled edges of lichens; or
Clarke crow or jay examining the cones;
or some singer  oriole, tanager, warbler
 resting, feeding, attending to domes-
tic affairs. Hawks and eagles sail over-
head, grouse walk in happy flocks below,
and song sparrows sing in every bed of
chaparral. There is no crowding, to be
sure. Unlike the low Eastern trees, those
of the Sierra in the main forest belt aver-
age nearly two hundred feet in height,
and of course many birds are required

mits is shaken into song every summer;
and though low and thin in winter, the

	The sage cock  Centroeercus uro-

that was then just able to fly. It was

where the Mono Desert meets the gray
foothills of the Sierra; but since cattle
have been pastured there they are be-
coming rarer every year.
	Another magnificent bird, the blue or
dusky grouse, next in size to the sage
cock, is found all through the main forest
belt, though not in great numbers. They
like best the heaviest silver - fir woods
near garden and meadow openings, where
there is but little underbrush to cover the
approach of enemies. When a flock of
these brave birds, sauntering and feed-
ing on the sunny flowery levels of some
hidden meadow or Yosemite valley far
back in the heart of the mountains, see a
man for the first time in their lives, they
rise with hurried notes of surprise and ex-
citement and alight on the lowest branches
of the trees, wondering what the wander-
er may be, and showing great eagerness
to get a good view of the strange vertical
animal. Knowing nothing of guns, they
allow you to approach within a half dozen
paces, then quietly hop a few branches
higher or fly to the next tree without a
thought of concealment, so that you may
observe them as long as you like, near
enough to see the fine shading of their
plumage, the feathers on their toes, and
the innocent wonderment in their beauti-
ful wild eyes. But in the neighborhood
of roads and trails they soon become shy,
and when disturbed fly into the highest,
leafiest trees, and suddenly become invis-
ible, so well do they know how to hide
and keep still and make use of their pro-
tective coloring. Nor can they be easily
dislodged ere they are ready to go. In
vain the hunter goes round and round
some tall pine or fir into which he has
perhaps seen a dozen enter, gazing up
through the branches, straining his eyes
while his gun is held ready; not a fea-
ther can he see unless his eyes have been
sharpened by long experience and know-
ledge of the blue grouses habits. Then,
perhaps, when he is thinking that the tree
must be hollow and that the birds have
all gone inside, they burst forth with a
startling whir of wing - beats, and after
gaining full speed go skating swiftly away
through the forest arches in a long, silent,
wavering slide, with wings held steady.
	During the summer they are most of
the time on the ground, feeding on in-
sects, seeds, berries, etc., around the mar-
gills of open spots and rocky moraines,
playing and sauntering, taking sun baths
and sand baths, and drinking at little
pools and rills during the heat of the
day. In winter they live mostly in the
trees, depending on buds for food, shelter-
ing beneath dense overlapping branches
at night and during storms on the lee-
side of the trunk, sunning themselves on
the southside limbs in fine weather, and
sometimes diving into the mealy snow to
flutter and wallow, apparently for exer-
cise and fun.
	I have seen young broods running
beneath the firs in June at a height of
eight thousand feet above the sea. On the
approach of danger, the mother with a
peculiar cry warns the helpless midgets
to scatter and bide beneath leaves and
twigs, and even in plain open places it is
almost impossible to discover them. In
the meantime the mother feigns lame-
ness, throws herself at your feet, kicks
and gasps and flutters, to draw your at-
tention from the chicks. The young are
generally able to fly about the middle of
July; but even after they can fly well
they are usually advised to run and hide
and lie still, no matter how closely ap-
proached, while the mother goes on with
her loving, lying acting, apparently as
desperately concerned for their safety
as when they were featherless infants.
Sometimes, however, after carefully
studyiiig the circumstances, she tells them
to take wing; and up and away in a blur-
ry birr and whir they scatter to all points
of the compass, as if blown up with gun-
powder, dropping cunningly out of sight
three or four hundred yards off, and keep-
ing quiet until called, after the danger
is supposed to be past. If you walk on
a little way without manifesting any in-</PB>

clination to hunt them, you may sit down
at the foot of a tree near enough to see
and hear the happy reunion. One touch
of nature makes the whole world kin;
and it is truly wonderful how love-telling
the small voices of these birds are, and
how far they reach through the woods
into one anothers hearts and into ours.
The tones are so perfectly human and
so full of anxious affection, few moun-
taineers can fail to be touched by them.
	They are cared for until full grown.
On the 20th of August, as I was passing
along the margin of a garden spot on the
head-waters of the San Joaquin, a grouse
rose from the ruins of an old juniper that
had been uprooted and brought down by
an avalanche from a cliff overhead. She
threw herself at my feet, limped and flut-
tered and gasped, showing, as I thought,
that she had a nest and was raising a
second brood. Looking for the eggs, I
was surprised to see a strong - winged
flock nearly as large as the mother fly up
around me.
	Instead of seeking a warmer climate
when the winter storms set in, these hardy
birds stay all the year in the High Sierra
forests, and I have never known them
to suffer in any sort of weather. Able
to live on the buds of pine, spruce, and
fir, they are forever independent in the
matter of food supply, which gives so
many of us trouble, dragging us here
and there away from our best work.
How gladly I would live on pine buds,
however pitchy, for the sake of this grand
independence. With all his superior re-
sources, man makes more distractin.g dif-
ficulty concerning food than any other
of the family.
	The mountain quail or plumed par-
tridge (Oreortyx pictus plumiferus) is
common in all the upper portions of the
park, though nowhere found in large
numbers. He ranges considerably high-
er than the grouse in summer, but is
unable to endure the heavy storms of
winter. When his food is buried he de-
scends the range to the brushy foothills,
	VOL. LXXXII.  NO. 494.	48
	a height of from two thousand to three
thousand feet above the sea; but like
every true mountaineer, he is quick to
follow the spring back into the highest
mountains. I think he is the very hand-
somest and most interesting of all the
American partridges, larger and hand-
somer than the famous Bob White, or
even the fine California valley quail or
the Massena partridge of Arizona and
Mexico. That he is not so regarded, is
because as a lonely mountaineer he is
not half known.
	His plumage is delicately shaded,
brown above, white and rich chestnut
below and on the sides, with many dainty
markings of black and white and gray
here and there, while his beautiful head
plume, three or four inches long, nearly
straight, composed of two feathers close-
ly folded so as to appear as one, is worn
jauntily slanted backward like a single
feather in a boys cap, giving him a very
marked appearance. They wander over
the lonely mountains in family flocks of
from six to fifteen, beneath ceanothus,
manzanita, and wild cherry thickets, and
over dry sandy flats, glacier meadows,
rocky ridges, and beds of bryanthus
around glacier lakes, especially in au-
tumn when the berries of the upper gar-
dens are ripe, uttering low clucking notes
to enable them to keep together. When
they are so suddenly disturbed that they
are afraid they cannot escape the danger
by running into thickets, they rise with
a fine hearty whir and scatter in the
brush over an area of half a square mile
or so, a few of them diving into leafy
trees. But as soon as the danger is past,
the parents with a clear piping note call
them together again. By the end of July
the young are two thirds grown and fly
well, though only dire necessity can com-
pel them to try their wings. In gait,
gestures, habits, and general behavior
they are like domestic chickens, but in-
finitely finer, searching for insects and
seeds, looking to this side and that,
scratching among fallen leaves, jumping</PB>

up to pull down grass heads, and cluck-
ing and muttering in low tones.
	Once when I was seated at the foot of
a tree on the head-waters of the Merced,
sketching, I heard a flock up the valley
behind me, and by their voices gradually
sounding nearer I knew that they were
feeding toward me. I kept still, hoping
to see them. Soon one came within
three or four feet of me, without noti-
cing me any more than if I were a stump
or a bulging part of the trunk against
which I was leaning, my clothing being
brown, nearly like the bark. Presently
along came another and another, and
it was delightful to get so near a view
of these handsome chickens perfectly un-
disturbed, observe their manners, and
hear their low peaceful notes. At last
one of them caught my eye, gazed in si-
lent wonder for a moment, then uttered
a peculiar cry, which was followed by a
lot of hurried muttered notes that sound-
ed like speech. The others, of course,
saw me as soon as the alarm was sound-
ed, and joined the wonder talk, gazing
and chattering, astonished but not fright-
ened. Then all with one accord ran
back with the news to the rest of the
flock. What is it? what is it? Oh,
you never saw the like, they seemed to
be saying. Not a deer, or a wolf, or
a bear; come see, come see. Where?
where? Down there by that tree.
Then they approached cautiously, past
the tree, stretching their necks, and look-
ing up in turn as if knowing from the
story told them just where I was. For
fifteen or twenty minutes they kept com-
ing and going, venturing within a few
feet of me, and discussing the wonder
in charming chatter. Their curiosity at
last satisfied, they began to scatter and
feed again, going back in the direction
they had come from; while I, loath to
part with them, followed noiselessly,
crawling beneath the bushes, keeping
them in sight for an hour or two, learn-
ing their habits, and finding out what
seeds and berries they liked best.
	The valley quail is not a mountaineer,
and seldom enters the park except at a
few of the lowest places on the western
boundary. It belongs to the brushy
foothills and plains, orchards and wheat-
fields, and is a hundred times more
numerous than the mountain quail. It
is a beautiful bird, about the size of the
Bob White, and has a handsome crest
of four or five feathers an inch long,
recurved, standing nearly erect at times
or drooping forward. The loud calls of
these quails in the spring  Pe-check-
ah, Pe-check-a, Hoy, Hoy  are heard
far and near over all the lowlands. They
have vastly increased in numbers since
the settlement of the country, notwith-
standing the immense numbers killed
every season by boys and pot-hunters as
well as the regular leggined sportsmen
from the towns; for mans destructive
action is more than counterbalanced by
increased supply of food from cultiva-
tion, and by the destruction of their ene-
mies  coyotes, skunks, foxes, hawks,
owls, etc.  which not only kill the old
birds, but plunder their nests. Where
coyotes and skunks abound, scarce one
pair in a hundred is successful in raising
a brood. So well aware are these birds
of the protection afforded by man, even
now that the number of their wild ene-
mies has been greatly diminished, that
they prefer to nest near houses, notwith-
standing they are so shy. Four or five
pairs rear their young around our cot-
tage every spring. One year a pair
nested in a straw pile within four or five
feet of the stable door, and did not leave
the eggs when the men led the horses
back and forth within a foot or two.
For many seasons a pair nested in a tuft
of pampas grass in the garden; another
pair in an ivy vine on the cottage roof,
and when the young were hatched, it
was interesting to see the parents getting
the fluffy dots down. They were great-
ly excited, and their anxious calls and
directions to their many babes attracted
our attention. They bad no great dif</PB>

ficulty in persuading the young birds to
pitch themselves from the main roof to
the porch roof among the ivy, but to get
them safely down from the latter to the
ground, a distance of ten feet, was most
distressing. It seemed impossible the
frail soft things could avoid being killed.
The anxious parents led them to a point
above a spir~a bush, that reached nearly
to the eaves, which they seemed to know
would break the fall. Anyhow they led
their chicks to this point, and with infi-
nite coaxing and encouragement got
them to tumble themselves off. Down
they rolled and sifted through the soft
leaves and panicles to the pavement, and,
strange to say, all got away unhurt ex-
cept one that lay as if dead for a few
minutes. When it revived, the joyful
parents, with their brood fairly launched
oa the journey of life, proudly led them
down the cottage hill, through the gar-
den, and along an osage orange hedge
into the cherry orchard. These charm-
ing birds even enter towns and villages,
where the gardens are of good size and
guns are forbidden, sometimes going sev-
eral miles to feed, and returning every
evening to their roosts in ivy or brushy
trees and shrubs.
	Geese occasionally visit the park, but
never stay long. Sometimes on their
way across the range, a flock wanders
into Hetch-Hetchy or Yosemite to rest
or get something to eat, and if shot at,
are often sorely bewildered in seeking a
way out. I have seen them rise from
the meadow or river, wheel round in a
spiral until a height of four or five hun-
dred feet was reached, then form ranks
and try to fly over the wall. But Yo-
semite magnitudes seem to be as decep-
tive to geese as to men, for they would
suddenly find themselves against the
cliffs not a fourth of the way to the top.
Then turning in confusion, and scream-
ing at the strange heights, they would
try the opposite side, and so on, until ex-
hausted they were compelled to rest, and
only after discovering the river caiion
could they make their escape. Large
harrow-shaped flocks may often be seen
crossing the range in the spring, at a
height of at least fourteen thousand feet.
Think of the strength of wing required
to sustain so heavy a bird in air so thin.
At this elevation it is but little over half
as dense as at the sea level. Yet they
hold bravely on in beautifully dressed
ranks, and have breath enough to spare
for loud honking. After the crest of the
Sierra is passed it is only a smooth slide
down the sky to the waters of Mono,
where they may rest as long as they
like.
	Ducks of five or six species, among
which are the mallard and wood duck,
go far up into the heart of the moun-
tains in the spring, and of course come
down in the fall with the families they
have reared. A few, as if loath to leave
the mountains, pass the winter in the
lower valleys of the park at a height of
three thousand to four thousand feet,
where the main streams are never wholly
frozen over, and snow never falls to a
great depth or lies long. In summer
they are found up to a height of eleven
thousand feet on all the lakes and
branches of the rivers except the small-
est, and those beside the glaciers encum-
bered with drifting ice and snow. I found
mallards and wood ducks at Lake Te-
naya, June 1, before the ice-covering was
half melted, and a flock of young ones
in Bloody Cafion Lake, June 20. They
are usually met in pairs, never in large
flocks. No place is too wild or rocky
or solitary for these brave swimmers, no
stream too rapid. In the roaring, re-
sounding cafion torrents, they seem as
much at home as in the tranquil reaches
and lakes of the broad glacial valleys.
Abandoning themselves to the wild play
of the waters, they go drifting confid-
ingly through blinding, thrashing spray,
dancing on boulder-dashed waves, toss-
ing in beautiful security on rougher wa-
ter than is usually encountered by sea
birds when storms are blowing.</PB>

	A mother duck with her family of ten
little ones, waltzing round and round in
a pot-hole ornamented with foam bells,
huge rocks leaning over them, cascades
above and below and beside them, made
one of the most interesting bird pictures
I ever saw.
	I have never found the great northern
diver in the park lakes. Most of them
are inaccessible to him. He might plump
down into them, but would hardly be
able to get out of them, since, with his
small wings and heavy body, a wide ex-
panse of elbow room is required in rising.
Now and then one may be seen in the
lower Sierra lakes to the northward about
Lassens Butte and Shasta, at a height of
four thousand to five thousand feet, mak-
ing the loneliest places lonelier with the
wildest of wild cries.
	Plovers are found along the sandy
shores of nearly all the mountain lakes,
tripping daintily on the waters edge,
picking up insects; and it is interesting
to learn how few of these familiar birds
are required to make a solitude cheerful.
	Sandhill cranes are sometimes found
in comparatively small marshes, mere
dots in the mighty forest. In such spots,
at an elevation of from six thousand to
eight thousand feet above the sea, they
are occasionally met in pairs as early as
the end of May, while the snow is still
deep in the surrounding fir and sugar-
pine woods. And on sunny days in an-
tumn, large flocks may be seen sailing at
a great height above the forests, shaking
the crisp air into rolling waves with their
hearty koor-r-r, koor-r-r uck-uck, soaring
in circles for hours together on their
majestic wings, seeming to float without
effort like clouds, eying the wrinkled
landscape outspread like a map mottled
with lakes and glaciers and meadows,
and streaked with shadowy cafions and
streams, and surveying every frog marsh
and sandy flat within a hundred miles.
	Eagles and hawks are oftentimes seen
above the ridges and domes. The great-
est height at which I have observed them
was about twelve thousand feet, over the
summits of Mount Hoffman, in the mid-
dle region of the park. A few pairs had
their nests on the cliffs of this mountain,
and could be seen every day in sum-
mer, hunting marmots, mountain beavers,
pikas, etc. A pair of golden eagles have
made their home in Yosemite ever since
I went there thirty years ago. Their
nest is on the Nevada Fall Cliff, oppo-
site the Liberty Cap. Their screams are
rather pleasant to hear in the vast gulfs
between the granite cliffs, and they help
the owls in keeping the echoes busy.
	But of all the birds of the High Sierra,
the strangest, noisiest, and most notable
is the Clarke crow (Nucifraga columbi-
ana). He is a foot long and nearly two
feet in extent of wing, ashy gray in gen-
eral color, with black wings, white tail,
and a strong sharp bill, with which he
digs into pine cones for the seeds on
which he mainly subsists. He is quick,
boisterous, jerky, and irregular in his
movements and speech, and makes a tre-
mendously loud and showy advertise-
ment of himself,  swooping and diving
in deep curves across gorges and valleys
from ridge to ridge, alighting on dead
spars, looking warily about him, and leav-
ing his dry springy perches trembling
from the vigor of his kick as he launches
himself for a new flight, screaming from
time to time loud enough to be heard
more than a mile in still weather. He
dwells far back on the high, storm-beaten
margin of the forest, where the mountain
pine, juniper, and hemlock grow wide
apart on glacier pavements and domes
and rough crumbling ridges, and the
dwarf pine makes a low crinkled growth
along the flanks of the summit peaks.
In so open a region, of course, he is well
seen. Everybody notices him, and no-
body at first knows what to make of him.
One guesses he must be a woodpecker,
another a crow or some sort of jay, an-
other a magpie. He seems to be a pret-
ty thoroughly mixed and fermented com-
pound of all these birds, has all their</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00763" SEQ="0763" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="757">	Among the Birds of the Yosemite.	757

strength, cunning, shyness, thievishness,
and wary, suspicious curiosity combined
and condensed. He flies like a wood-
pecker, hammers dead limbs for insects,
digs big holes in pine cones to get at the
seeds, cracks nuts held between his toes,
cries like a crow or Steller jay,  but
in a far louder, harsher, and more for-
bidding tone of voice,  and besides his
crow caws and screams, has a great va-
riety of small chatter talk, mostly uttered
in a fault-finding tone. Like the mag-
pie, he steals articles that can be of no
use to him. Once when I made my camp
in a grove at Cathedral Lake, I chanced
to leave a cake of soap on the shore
where I had been washing, and a few
minutes afterward I saw my soap flying
past me through the grove, pushed by a
Clarke crow.
	In winter, when the snow is deep, the
cones of the mountain pines empty, and
the juniper, hemlock, and dwarf pine or-
chards buried, he comes down to glean
seeds in the yellow pine forests, startling
the grouse with his loud screams. But
even in winter, in calm weather, he stays
in his high mountain home, defying the
bitter frost. Once I lay snowbound
through a three days storm at the tim-
ber-line on Mount Shasta; and while the
roaring snow-laden blast swept by, one of
these brave birds came to my camp, and
began hammering at the cones on the
topmost branches of half-buried pines,
without showing the slightest distress.
I have seen Clarke crows feeding their
young as early as June 19, at a height
of more than ten thousand feet, when
nearly the whole landscape was snow-
covered.
	They are excessively shy,~ and keep
away from the traveler as long as they
think they are observed; but when one
goes on without seeming to notice them,
or sits down and keeps still, their curi-
osity speedily gets the better of their
caution, and they come flying from tree
to tree, nearer and nearer, and watch
every motion. Few, I am afraid, will
ever learn to like this bird, he is so sus-
picious and self-reliant, and his voice is
so harsh that to most ears the scream of
the eagle will seem melodious compared
with it. Yet the mountaineer who has
battled and suffered and struggled must
admire his strength and endurance, 
the way he faces the mountain weather,
cleaves the icy blasts, cares for his young,
and digs a living from the stern wilder-
ness. Higher yet than Nucifraga dwells
the little dun - headed sparrow (Leuco.
sticte tephroeotis). From early spring
to late autumn he is to be found only
on the snowy icy peaks at the head of
the glacier cirques and cafions. His feed-
ing grounds in spring are the snow sheets
between the peaks, and in midsummer
and autumn the glaciers. Many bold in-
sects go mountaineering almost as soon
as they are born, ascending the highest
summits on the mild breezes that blow
in from the sea every day during steady
weather; but comparatively few of these
adventurers find their way down or see
a flower bed again. Getting tired and
chilly, they alight on the snow fields and
glaciers, attracted perhaps by the glare,
take cold, and die. There they lie as if
on a white cloth purposely outspread for
them, and the dun sparrows find them
a rich and varied repast requiring no
pursuit,  bees al-id butterflies on ice,
and many spicy beetles, a perpetual feast,
on tables big for guests so small, and in
vast banqueting halls ventilated by cool
breezes that ruffle the feathers of the
fairy brownies. Happy fellows, no rivals
come to dispute possession with them.
No other birds, not even hawks, as far
as I have noticed, live so high. They
see people so seldom, they flutter around
the explorer with the liveliest curiosity,
and come down a little way, sometimes
nearly a mile, to meet him and conduct
him into their icy homes.
	When I was exploring the Merced
group, climbing up the grand calion be-
tween the Merced and Red mountains
into the fountain amphitheatre of an an-</PB>

cient glacier, just as I was approaching
the small active glacier that leans back
in the shadow of Merced Mountain, a
flock of twenty or thirty of these little
birds, the first I had seen, came down
the cafton to meet me, flying low, straight
toward me as if they meant to fly in my
face. Instead of attacking me or pass-
ing by, they circled round my head,
chirping and fluttering for a minute or
two, then turned and escorted me up the
cailon, alighting on the nearest rocks on
either hand, and flying ahead a few
yards at a time to keep even with me.
	I have not discovered their winter
quarters. Probably they are in the de-
sert ranges to the eastward, for I never
saw any of them in Yosemite, the win-
ter refuge of so many of the mountain
birds.
	Hummingbirds are among the best and
most conspicuous of the mountaineers,
flashing their ruby throats in countless
wild gardens far up the higher slopes,
where they would be least expected. All
one has to do to enjoy the company of
these mountain-loving midgets is to dis-
play a showy blanket or handkerchief.
	The arctic bluebird is another delight-
ful mountaineer, singing a wild, cheery
song and carrying the sky on his back
over all the gray ridges and domes of
the subalpine region.
	A fine, hearty, good-natured lot of
woodpeckers dwell in the park, and keep
it lively all the year round. Among
the most notable of these are the mag-
nificent log cock (CeophUens pileatus),
the prince of Sierra woodpeckers, and
only second in rank, as far as I know, of
all the woodpeckers of the world; the
Lewis woodpecker, large, black, glossy,
that flaps and flies like a crow, does but
little hammering, and feeds in great part
on wild cherries and berries; and the
carpenter, who stores up great quantities
of acorns in the bark of trees for winter
use. The last named species is a beau-
tiful bird, charmingly familiar and far
more common than the others. In the
woods of the West he represents the
eastern red-head. Bright, cheerful, in-
dustrious, not in the least shy, the car-
penters give delightful animation to the
open Sierra forests at a height of from
three thousand to fifty-five hundred feet,
especially in autumn when the acorns are
ripe. Then no squirrel works harder at
his pine-nut harvest than these wood-
peckers at their acorn harvest, drilling
holes in the thick, corky bark of the yel-
low pine and incense cedar, in which to
store the crop for winter use; a hole for
each acorn, so nicely adjusted as to size
that when the acorn, point foremost, is
driven in, it fits so well that it cannot be
drawn out without digging around it.
Each acorn is thus carefully stared in
a dry bin, perfectly protected from the
weather,  a most laborious method of
stowing away a crop, a granary for each
kernel. Yet the birds seem never to
weary at the work, but go on so dili-
gently that they seem determined to save
every acorn in the grove. They are never
seen eating acorns at the time they are
storing them, and it is commonly be-
lieved that they never eat them or intend
to eat them, but that the wise birds store
them and protect them from the depreda-
tions of squirrels and jays, solely for the
sake of the worms they are supposed to
contain. And because these worms are
too small for use at the time the acorns
drop, they are shut up like lean calves
and steers, each in a separate stall with
abundance of food, to grow big and fat
by the time they will be most wanted,
that is, in winter, when insects are scarce
and stall-fed worms most valuable. So
these woodpeckers are supposed to be a
sort of cattle-raisers, each with a drove
of thousands, rivaling the ants that raise
grain and keep herds of plant lice for
milk cows. Needless to say the story is
not true, though some naturalists even
believe it. When Emerson was in the
park, having heard the worm story and
seen the great pines plugged full of
acorns, he asked (just to pump me,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00765" SEQ="0765" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="759">	Among the Birds of the Yosemite.	759

I suppose), Why do the woodpeckers
take the trouble to put acorns into the
bark of the trees? For the same
reason, I replied,  that bees store
honey and squirrels nuts. But they
tell me, Mr. Muir, that woodpeckers
dont eat acorns. Yes, they do, I
said, I have seen them eating them.
During snowstorms they seem to eat lit-
tle besides acorns. I have repeatedly
interrupted them at their meals, and seen
the perfectly sound, half-eaten acorns.
They eat them in the shell as some peo-
ple eat eggs. But what about the
worms? I suppose, I said, that
when they come to a wormy one they
eat both worm and acorn. Anyhow,
they eat the sound ones when they cant
find anything they like better, and from
the time they store them until they are
used they guard them, and woe to the
squirrel or jay caught stealing. In-
dians, in times of scarcity, frequently
resort to these stores and chop them out
with hatchets; a bushel or more may be
gathered from a single cedar or pine.
	The common robin, with all his famil-
iar notes and gestures, is found nearly
everywhere throughout the park,  in
shady dells beneath dogwoods and ma-
ples, along the flowery banks of the
streams, tripping daintily about the mar-
gins of meadows in the firand pine woods,
and far beyond on the shores of glacier
lakes and the slopes of the peaks. How
admirable the constitution and temper
of this cheery, graceful bird, keeping glad
health over so vast and varied a range.
In all America he is at home, flying
from plains to mountains up and down,
north and south, away and back, with the
seasons and supply of food. Oftentimes,
in the High Sierra, as you wanderthrough
the solemn woods, awe-stricken and si-
lent, you will hear the reassuring voice of
this fellow wanderer ringing out sweet
and clear as if saying, Fear not, fear
not. Only love is here. In the sever-
est solitudes he seems as happy as in gar-
dens and apple orchards.
	The robins enter the park as soon as the
snow melts, and go on up the mountains,
gradually higher, with the opening flow-
ers, until the topmost glacier meadows
are reached in June and July. After the
short summer is done, they descend like
most other summer visitors in concord
with the weather, keeping out of the first
heavy snows as much as possible, while
lingering among the frost-nipped wild
cherries on the slopes just below the
glacier meadows. Thence they go to the
lower slopes of the forest region, com-
pelled to make haste at times by heavy
all-day storms, picking up seeds or be-
numbed insects by the way, and at last
all, save a few that winter in Yose-
mite valleys, arrive in the vineyards
and orchards and stubble-fields of the
lowlands in November, picking up fallen
fruit and grain, and awakening old-time
memories among the white-headed pio-
neers, who cannot fail to recognize the
influence of so homelike a bird. They
are then in flocks of hundreds, and make
their way into the gardens of towns as
well as into the parks and fields and or-
chards about the bay of San Francisco,
where many of the wanderers are shot
for sport and the morsel of meat on
their breasts. Man then seems a beast
of prey. Not ev~n genuine piety can
make the robin-killer quite respectable.
Saturday is the great slaughter day in
the bay region. Then the city pot-hunt-
ers, with a ragtag of boys, go forth to
kill, kept in countenance by a sprinkling
of regular sportsmen arrayed in self-
conscious majesty and leggins, leading
dogs and carrying hammerless, breech-
loading guns of famous makers. Over
the fine landscapes the killing goes for~
ward with shameful enthusiasm. After
escaping countless dangers, thousands
fall, big bagfuls are gathered, many are
left wounded to die slowly, no Red Cross
Society to help them. Next day, Sun-
day, the blood and leggins vanish from
the most devout of the bird butchers,
who go to church. carrying gold-headed</PB>

canes instead of guns. After hymns,
prayers, and sermon they go home to
feast, to put Gods songbirds to use, put
them in their dinners instead of in their
hearts, eat them, and suck the pitiful lit-
tle drumsticks. It is only race living on
race, to be sure, but Christians singing
Divine Love need not be driven to such
straits while wheat and apples grow and
the shops are full of dead cattle. Song-
birds for food! Compared with this,
making kindlings of pianos and violins
would be pious economy.
	The larks come in large flocks from
the hills and mountains in the fall, and
are slaughtered as ruthlessly as the rob-
ins. Fortunately, most of our songbirds
keep back in leafy hidings, and are com-
paratively inaccessible.
	The water ouzel, in his rocky home
amid foaming waters, seldom sees a gun,
and of all the singers I like him the
best. He is a plainly dressed little bird,
about the size of a robin, with short, crisp,
but rather broad wings, and a tail of
moderate length, slanted up, giving him
with his nodding, bobbing manners a
wrennish look. He is usually seen flut-
tering about in the spray of falls and
the rapid cascading portions of the main
branches of the rivers. These are his fa-
vorite haunts; but he is often seen also
on comparatively level reaches and occa-
sionally on the shores of mountain lakes,
especially at the beginning of winter,
when heavy snowfalls have blurred the
streams with sludge. Though not a wa-
ter bird in structure, he gets his living in
the water, and is never seen away from
the immediate margin of streams. He
dives fearlessly into rough, boiling eddies
and rapids to feed at the bottom, flying
under water seemingly as easily as in
the air. Sometimes he wades in shallow
places, thrusting his head under from
time to time in a nodding, frisky way
that is sure to attract attention. His
flight is a solid whir of wing-beats like
that of a partridge, and in going from
place to place along his favorite string
of rapids he follows the windings of the
stream, and usually alights on some rock
or snag on the bank or out in the cur-
rent, or rarely on the dry limb of an
overhanging tree, perching like a tree
bird when it suits his convenience. He
has the oddest, neatest manners im-
aginable, and all his gestures as he flits
about in the wild, dashing waters be-
speak the utmost cheerfulness and con-
fidence. He sings both winter and sum-
mer, in all sorts of weather,  a sweet,
fluty melody, rather low, and much less
keen and accentuated than from the
brisk vigor of his movements one would
be led to expect.
	How romantic and beautiful is the life
of this brave little singer on the wild
mountain streams, building his round
bossy nest of moss by the side of a rapid
or fall, where it is sprinkled and kept
fresh and green by the spray! No won-
der he sings well, since all the air about
him is music; every breath he draws is
part of a song, and he gets his first music
lessons before he is born; for the eggs
vibrate in time with the tones of the
waterfalls. Bird and stream are insep-
arable, songful and wild, gentle and
strong,  the bird ever in danger in the
midst of the streams mad whirlpools,
yet seeming immortal. And so I might
go on, writing words, words, words; but
to what purpose? Go see him and love
him, and through him as through a win-
dow look into Natures warm heart.

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A REVOLUTIONIST.

THE CORPS OF PAGES.

I.

	IN August, 1857, the long-cherished
ambition of my father was realized.
There was a vacancy in the corps of
pages which I could fill before I had
got beyond the age to which admission
was limited, and I was taken to St.
Petersburg and entered the school.
Only a hundred and fifty boys  most-
ly children of the nobility belonging to
the court  received education in this
privileged corps, which combined the
character of a military school endowed
with special rights and of a court in-
stitution attached to the imperial house-
hold. After a stay of four or five years
in the corps of pages, those who had
passed the final examinations were re-
ceived as officers in any regiment of
the guard or of the army they chose,
irrespective of the number of vacancies
in that regiment; and each year the
first sixteen pupils of the highest form
were nominated jpages de chambre; that
is, they were personally attached to the
several members of the imperial fam-
ily,  the Emperor, the Empress, the
grand duchesses, and the grand dukes.
That was considered, of course, a great
honor; and, moreover, the young men
upon whom this honor was bestowed be-
came knowii at the court, and had after-
ward every chance of being nominated
aides-de-camp of the Emperor or of one
of the grand dukes, and consequently had
every facility for niaking a brilliant ca-
reer in the service of the state. Fathers
and mothers of families connected with
the court took due care, therefore, that
their boys should not miss entering the
corps of pages, even though entrance had
to be secured at the expense of other can-
didates who never saw a place opening
for them. Now that I was in the select
corps my father could give a free flight
to his ambitious dreams.
	The corps was divided into five forms,
of which the highest was the first, aiid
the lowest the fifth, and the intention
was that I should enter the fourth form.
However, as it appeared at the examina-
tions that I was not sufficiently familiar
with decimal fractions, and as the fourth
form contained that year over forty pu-
pils, while only twenty had been mustered
for the fifth form, I was enrolled in the
latter.
	I felt extremely vexed at this decision.
It was with reluctance that I entered a
military school, and now I should have
to stay in it five years instead of four.
What should I do in the fifth form, when
I knew already all that would be taught
in it? With tears in my eyes I spoke of
it to the inspector (the head of the edu-
cational department), but he answered
me with a joke. You know, he re-
marked, what C~sar said,  better to
be the first in a village than the second
in Rome. To which I warmly replied
that I should prefer to be the very last,
if only I could leave the military school
as soon as possible. Perhaps, after
some time, you will like the school, he
remarked, and from that day he took a
liking to me.
	To the teacher of arithmetic, who also
tried to console me, I gave my word of
honor that I would never cast a glance
into his textbook; and nevertheless you
will have to give me the highest marks.
I kept my word; but thinking now of
this scene, I fancy that the pupil was not
even then of a very docile disposition.
	And yet, as I look back upon that re-
mote past, I cannot but feel grateful
for having been put in the lower form.</PB></P>

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A REVOLUTIONIST.

THE CORPS OF PAGES.

I.

	IN August, 1857, the long-cherished
ambition of my father was realized.
There was a vacancy in the corps of
pages which I could fill before I had
got beyond the age to which admission

Only a hundred and fifty boys  most-

Having only to repeat during the first
year what I already knew, I got into the
habit of learning my lessons by merely
listening to what the teachers said in the
classroom; and, the lessons over, I had
plenty of time to read and to write to my
hearts content. When I reached the
higher special forms, I was better pre-
pared to master the variety of subjects
we had to study. All children, I now
think, would be benefited very much if
serious teaching did not begin for them
before they have reached a certain de-
velopment, usually attained at about the
age of fifteen. After that age they learn
veryquickly, and far better, what would
have taken them years to master when
younger; and those early years could be
so well utilized in many other ways. Be-
sides, I spent more than half of the first
winter in the hospital. Like all children
who are not born at St. Petersburg, I had
to pay a heavy tribute to the capital on
the swamps of Finland, in the shape of
several attacks of local cholera, and final-
ly one of typhoid fever.

	When I entered the corps of pages,
its inner life was undergoing a profound
change. All Russia awakened at that
time from the heavy slumber and the
nightmare of the terrible years of Nicho-
las I.s reign. Our school also felt the
effects of that revival. I do not know,
in fact, what would have become of me,
had I entered the corps of pages one or
two years sooner. Either my will would
have been totally broken, or I should have
bcen excluded from the school with no
one knows what consequences. Happily,
the transition period was already in full
sway in the year 1857.
	The director of the corps was an excel-
lent old man, General Zheltiiikhin. But
he was the nominal head only. The real
master of the school was the Colonel,
 Colonel Girardot, a Frenchman in the
Russian service. People said he was a
Jesuit, and so he was, I believe. His
ways. at any rate, were thoroughly im
bued with the teachings of Loyola, and
his educational methods were those of the
French Jesuit colleges.
	Imagine a short, extremely thin man,
with dark, piercing, and furtive eyes,
wearing very short clipped mustaches,
which gave him the expression of a cat;
very quiet and firm; not remarkably
intelligent, but exceedingly cunning; a
despot at the bottom of his heart, who
was capable of hating intensely hating
 the boy who would not fall under his
fascination, and of expressing that ha-
tred, not by silly persecutions, hut, un-
ceasingly, by his general behavior,  by
an occasionally dropped word, a gesture,
a smile, an interjection. His walk was
more like gliding along, and the explor-
ing glances he used to cast round without
turning his head completed the illusion.
A stamp of cold dryness was impressed
on his lips, even when he tried to look
well disposed, and that expression be-
came still more harsh when his mouth
was contorted by a smile of discontent or
of contempt. With all this there was
nothing of a commander in him; you
would rather think, at first sight, of a be-
nevolent father who talks to his children
as if they were full-grown people. And
yet, you soon felt that every one and
everything had to bend before his will.
Woe to the boy who would not feel hap-
py or unhappy accord5ng to the degree
of good will shown toward him by the
Colonel.
	The words the Colonel were con-
tinually on all lips. Other officers went
by their nicknames, but no one dared
to give a nickname to the Colonel. A
sort of mystery hung about him, as if he
were omniscient and everywhere present.
True, he spent all the day and part of
the night in the school. Even when we
were in the classes he prowled about, vis-
iting our drawers, which he opened with
his own keys. As to the night, he gave
a good portion of it to the task of inscrib-
ing in certain small books,  of which he
had quite a lihrary,  in separate col</PB>

umns, by special signs and in inks of dif-
ferent colors, all the faults and virtues of
each boy.
	Play, jokes, and conversations stopped
when we saw him slowly moving along
through our spacious rooms, hand in hand
with one of his favorites, balancing his
body forward and backward; smiling at
one boy, keenly looking into the eyes of
another, casting an indifferent glance
upon a third, and giving a slight contor-
tion to his lip as he passed a fourth: and
from these looks every one knew that he
liked the first boy, that to the second he
was indifferent, that he intentionally did
not notice the third, and that he disliked
the fourth. This dislike was enough to
terrify most boys,  the more so as no
reason could be given for it. Impres-
sionable boys had been brought to de-
spair by that mute, unceasingly displayed
aversion and those suspicious looks; in
others the result had been a total annihi-
lation of will, as one of the Toistoys 
Theodor, also a pupil of Girardot  has
shown in an autobiographic novel, The
Diseases of the Will.

	The inner life of the corps was miser-
able under the rule of the Colonel. In
all boarding - schools the newly entered
boys are subjected to petty persecutions.
The greenhorns are submitted in this
way to a test. What are they worth?
Are they going to turn telltales? And
then the old hands like to show to
newcomers the superiority of an estab-
lished brotherhood. So it goes in all
schools and in prisons. But under Gi-
rardots rule these persecutions took on a
harsher aspect, and they came, not from
the comrades of th~ same form, but from
the first form,  the pages de chambre,
who were non-commissioned officers, and
whom Girardot had placed in a quite
exceptional, superior position. His sys-
tem was to give them carte blanche; to
pretend that he did not know even the
horrors they were enacting; and to ~inain-
tam through them a severe discipline.
of a Revolutionist.	763

To answer a blow received from a page
de chambre would have meant, in the
times of Nicholas I., to be sent to a battal-
ion of soldiers sons, if the fact became
public; and to revolt in any way against
the mere caprice of a page de chambre
meant that the twenty youths of the first
form, armed with their heavy oak rulers,
would assemble in a room, and, with Gi-
rardots tacit approval, administer a se-
vere beating to the boy who had shown
such a spirit of insubordination.
	Accordingly, the first form did what
they liked; and not further back than the
preceding winter one of their favorite
games had been to assemble the green-
horns at night in a room, in their night-
shirts, and to make them run round, like
horses in a circus, while the pages de
chambre, armed with thick india - rub-
ber whips, standing some in the centre
and the others on the outside, pitilessly
whipped the boys. As a rule the cir-
cus ended in an Oriental fashion, in an
abominable way. The moral conceptions
which prevailed at that time, and the foul
talk which went on in the school concern-
ing what occurred at night after a circus,
were such that the least said about them
the better.
	The Colonel knew all this. He had a
perfectly organized system of espionage,
and nothing escaped his knowledge. But
so long as he was not known to know it,
all was right. To shut his eyes to what
was done by the first form was the foun-
dation of his system of maintaining dis-
cipline.
	However, a new spirit was awakened
in the school, and only a few months
before I entered it a revolution had
taken place. That year the third form
was different from what it had hitherto
been. It contained a number of young
men who learned splendidly, and read a
good deal; some of them became, later,
men of mark. My first acquaintance
with one of them  let me call him von
Schauff  was when he was reading
Kants Critique of Pure Reason. Be-</PB>

sides, they had amongst them some of
the strongest youths of the school. The
tallest member of the corps was in that
form, as also a very strong young man,
K6shtoff, a great friend of von Schauff.
	They could not bear the yoke of the
pages de chambre with the same docil-
ity with which it had been endured up
to that time; they looked with disgust
upon what was going on; and in conse-
quence of an incident, which I prefer
not to describe, a fight took place be-
tween the third and the first form, with
the result that the pages de chambre got
a very severe thrashing from their subor-
dinates. Girardot hushed up the affair,
but the authority of the first form was
broken down. The india-rubber whips
remained, but never more were they put
to use. The circuses and the rest be-
came things of the past.
	That much was won; but the lowest
form, the fifth, composed almost entirely
of very young boys who had just entered
the school, had still to obey the petty
caprices of the pages de chambre with-
out murmuring. We had a beautiful
garden, filled with old trees, but the
boys of the fifth form could enjoy it lit-
tle: they were forced to run a round-
about, while the pages de chambre sat
in it and chattered, or to send back the
balls when these gentlemen played nine-
pins. A couple of days after I had
entered the school, seeing how things
stood in the garden, I did not go there,
but remained upstairs. I was reading,
when a page de chambre, with carroty
hair and a face covered with freckles,
came upon me, and ordered me to go at
once to the garden to run the roundabout.
	I will not; you see I am reading,
was my reply.
	Anger disfigured his already unplea-
sant face. He was ready to jump upon
me. I took the defensive. He tried to
give me blows on the face with his cap.
I fenced as best I could. Then he flung
his cap on the floor.
	Pick it up.
of a Revolutionist.

	Pick it up yourself.
	Such an act of disobedience was un-
heard of in the school. Why he did
not beat me unmercifully on the spot I
do not know. He was much older and
stronger than I was.
	Next day and the following days Ire-
ceived similar commands, but obstinate-
ly remained upstairs. Then began the
most exasperating petty persecutions at
every step,  enough to bring one to de-
spair. Happily, I was always of a jovial
disposition, and answered with jokes, or
took little heed of them. Still, my young-
er comrades were so vexed that they
asked the third form to interfere, but
received the wise reply that it would be
impossible to engage in a new fight for
such a reason. The third form, how-
ever, began to show us in various little
ways its friendly disposition; with von
Schauff we had many points of contact.
	Moreover, all this soon came to an
end. The weather turned rainy, and
we spent most of our time indoors. In
the garden the first form smoked freely
enough, but when we were indoors the
smoking club was the tower. It was
kept beautifully clean, and a fire was
always burning there. The pages de
chambre severely punished all others
whom they caught smoking, but they
themselves sat continually at the fire-
side chattering and enjoying cigarettes.
Their favorite smoking time was at night,
after all were supposed to have gone to
bed at ten; they kept their club till half
past eleven, and, to protect themselves
from an unexpected interruption by Gi-
rardot, they ordered us to keep watch.
The small boys of the fifth form were
taken out of their b~ds in turn, two at
a time, and they had to loiter about the
staircase till half past eleven, to give no-
tice of the approach of the Colonel.
	We decided to put an end to these
night watches. Long were the discus-
sions, and the higher forms were con-
sulted as to what was to be done. At
last the decision came: Refuse, all of</PB>

you, to keep the watch; and when they
begin to beat you, which they are sure
to do, go, as many of you as can, in a
block, and call in Girardot. He knows
it all, but then he will be bound to stop
it. The question whether that would
not be reporting was settled in the
negative by experts in honor matters:
the pages de chambre did not behave to-
ward the others like comrades.
	The turn to watch fell that night to
a Prince Sh , an old hand, and to
S , a newcomer, an extremely timid
boy, who even spoke in a girlish voice.
Sh was called upon first, but re-
fused to go, and was left alone. Then
two pages de chambre went to the timid
S ,who was in bed; as he refused
to obey, they began to flog him brutally
with heavy leather braces. Sh woke
up several comrades who were near at
hand, and they all ran to find Girardot.
	I was also in bed when th~ two came
upon me, ordering me to take the watch.
I refused. Thereupon, seizing two pairs
of braces,  we always used to put our
clothes in perfect order on a bench by
the bedside, braces uppermost, and the
necktie across them,  they began to flog
me. Sitting up in bed, I fenced with my
hands, and had already received several
heavy blows, when a command resound-
ed,  The first form to the Colonel!
The fierce fighters became tame at once,
and hurriedly put my things in order.
	Dont say a word, they whispered.
	The necktie across, in good order,
I said to them, while my shoulders and
arms burned from the blows.
	What Girardots talk with the first
form was we did not know; but next
day, as we stood in the ranks before
marching downstairs to the dining-room,
he addressed us in a minor key, saying
how sad it was that pages de chambre
should have fallen upon a boy who was
right in his refusal. And upon whom?
A newcomer, and so timid a boy as 5
was. The school were simply disgusted
at that Jesuitic speech.
of a Revolutionist.

	No need to say that that was the end
of the watch-keeping, and that it gave a
final blow to the worrying of the new-
comers: it has never been renewed.

	It surely was also a blow to Girar-
dots authority, and he resented it very
much. He regarded our form, and me
especially, with great dislike (the round-
about affair had been reported to him),
and he manifested it at every opportu-
nity.
	During the first winter I was a fre-
quent inmate of the hospital. After suf-
fering from typhoid fever, during which
the director and the doctor bestowed on
me a really parental care, I had very
bad and persistently recurring gastric
attacks. Girardot, as he made his daily
rounds of the hospital, seeing me so often
there, began to say to me every morn-
ing, half jokingly, in French, Here is
a young man who is as healthy as the
New Bridge, and loiters in the hospi-
tal. Once or twice I replied jestingly,
but at last, seeing malice in this constant
repetition, I lost patience. Frequently
boys pretended to be ill and went to the
hospital when they did not know their
lessons; but there was no necessity for
me to do so, and, as I never could bear
a suspicion of deceit, I grew very angry.
	How dare you say that? I ex-
claimed. I shall ask the doctor to for-
bid your entering this room, and so on.
	Girardot recoiled two steps  his dark
eyes glittered, his thin lip be~ame still
thinner. At last he said, I have of-
fended you, have I? Well, we have in
the hall two artillery guns: shall we have
a duel?
	I dont make jokes, and I tell you
that I shall bear no more of your insin-
uations, I continued.
	He did not repeat his joke, but re-
garded me with even more dislike than
before.
	Happily enough, there was little op-
portunity for punishing me. I did not
smoke; my clothes were always hooked</PB>

and buttoned, and properly folded at
night. I liked all sorts of games, but,
plunged as I was in reading and in a
correspondence with my brother, I could
hardly find time to play a lapta match
(a sort of cricket) in the garden, and al-
ways hurried back to my books. But
when I was caught in fault, it was not I
that Girardot punished, but the page de
chambre who was my superior. Once,
for instance, at dinner, I made a physi-
cal discovery: I noticed that the sound
given out by a tumbler depends on the
amount of water it contains, and at once
tried to obtain a chord with four glasses.
But there stood Girardot behind me,
and without saying a word to me he
ordered my page de chambre under ar-
rest. It so happened that this young
man was an excellent fellow, a third
cousin of mine, who refused even to lis-
ten to my excuses, saying, All right.
I know be dislikes you. His comrades,
though, gave me a warning. Take
care, naughty boy; we are not going to
be punished for you, they said; and if
reading had not been my all-absorbing
occupation, they probably would have
made me pay dearly for my physical ex-
periment.
	All the comrades and officers spoke of
Girardots dislike for me; but I paid no
attention to it, and probably increased
it by my indifference. For full eighteen
months he refused to give me the epau-
let,s, which were usually given to newly
entered 1~oys after one or two months
stay at the school, when they had learned
some of the rudiments of military drill;
but I felt quite happy without that mili-
tary decoration. At last, an officer 
the best teacher of drill in the school, a
man simply enamored of drill  volun-
teered to teach me; and when he saw
me performing all the tricks to his en-
tire satisfaction, he undertook to intro-
duce me to Girardot. The Colonel re-
fused again, twice in succession, so that
the officer took it as a personal offense;
and when the director of the corps once
asked him why I had no epaulets yet,
he bluntly answered, The boy is all
right; it is the Colonel who does not
want him; whereupon, probably after
a remark of the director, Girardot him-
self asked to reexamine me, and gave me
the epaulets that very dny.
	But the Colonels influence was rap-
idly vanishing. The whole character of
the school was changing. For twenty
years Girardot had realized his ideal,
which was to have the pages nicely
combed, curled, and girlish looking, and
to send to the court pages as refined as
courtiers of Louis XIV. Whether they
learned or not, he cared little; his favor-
ites were those whose clothes-baskets were
best filled with all sorts of nail-brushes
and scent bottles, whose private uni-
form (which could be put on when we went
home on Sundays) was of the best make,
and who knew how to make the most ele-
gant salut oblique. Formerly, when Gi-
rardot had held rehearsals of court cere-
monies, wrapping up a page in a striped
red cotton cover taken from one of our
beds, in order that he might represent the
Empress at a baisernctin, the boys almost
religiously approached the imaginary
Empress, seriously performed the cere-
mony of kissing the hand, and retired
with a most elegant oblique bow; but now,
though they were very elegant at court,
they would perform at the rehearsals such
bearlike bows that all roared with laugh-
ter, while Girardot was simply raging.
Formerly, the younger boys who had
been taken to a cou~rt levee, and had been
curled for that purpose, used to keep
their curls as long as they would last;
now, on returning from tIme palace, they
hurried to put their heads under the cold-
water tap, to get rid of the curls. An
effeminate appearance was laughed at.
To be sent to the palace to stand as a
decoration at a levee was now considered
a drudgery rather than a favor. And
when the small boys who were occasion-
ally taken to the palace to play with the
little grand dukes remarked that one of</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00773" SEQ="0773" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="767">	The Autobiography of a Revolutionist.	767

the latter used, in some game, to make a
hard whip out of his handkerchief, and
use it freely, one of our boys did the same,
and so whipped the grand duke that he
cried. Girardot was terrified, while the
old Sebastopol admiral who was tutor of
the grand duke only praised our boy.
	A new spirit, studious and serious, de-
veloped in the corps of pages, as in all
other schools. Informer years, the pages,
being sure that in one way or another
they would get the necessary marks for
being promoted officers of tfie guard,
spent the first years in the school hardly
learning at all, and only began to study
more or less in the last two forms; now
the lower forms learned very well. The
moral tone also became quite different
from what it was a few years before. Ori-
ental amusements were looked upon with
disgust, and an attempt or two to re-
vert to old manners resulted in scandals
which reached the St. Petersburg draw-
ing-rooms. Girardot was dismissed. He
was only allowed to retain his bache-
lor apartment in the building of the
corps, and we often saw him afterward,
wrapped in his long military cloak, pa-
cing along, plunged in reflections,  sad,
I suppose, because he could not but con-
demn the new spirit which rapidly de-
veloped in the corps of pages.

II.

	All over Russia people were talking
of education. As soon as peace had
been concluded at Paris, and the sever-
ity of censorship had been slightly re-
laxed, educational matters began to be
eagerly discussed. The ignorance of the
masses of the people, the obstacles that
had hitherto been put in the way of
those who wanted to learn, the absence
of schools in the country, the obsolete
methods of teaching, and the remedies
for these evils became favorite themes of
discussion in educated circles, in the
press, and even in the drawing-rooms of
the aristocracy. The first high schools
for girls had been opened in 1857, on
an excellent plan and with a splendid
teaching staff. As by magic a number
of men and women came to the front
who not only have since devoted their
lives to education, but have proved to be
such remarkable practical pedagogists
that their writings would occupy a place
of honor in every civilized literature, if
they were known abroad.
	The corps of pages also felt the ef-
fect of that revival. Apart from a few
exceptions, the general tendency of the
three younger forms was to study. The
head of the educational department, the
inspector, Winkler, who was a well-edu-
cated colonel of artillery, a good math-
ematician, and a man of progressive
opinions, hit upon an excellent plan for
stimulating that spirit. Instead of the
indifferent teachers who formerly used
to teach in the lower forms, he endea-
vored to secure the best ones. In his
opinion, no professor was too good to
teach the very beginnings of a subject
to the youngest boys. Thus, to teach
the elements of algebra in the fourth
form he invited a first-rate mathemati-
cian and a born teacher, Captain Sukh6-
nin, and the form took at once to mathe-
matics. By the way, it so happened
that this captain was a tutor of the heir
of the throne (Nikolai Alexdndrovich,
who died at the age of twenty-two), and
the heir apparent was brought once a
week to the corps of pages to be pre-
sent ~t the algebra lessons of Captain
Sukh6nin. Empress Marie Alexdndrov-
na, who was an educated woman, thought
that perhaps the contact with studious
boys would stimulate her son to learn-
ing. He sat amongst us, and had to an-
swer questions like all the others. But
he managed mostly, while the teacher
spoke, to make drawings very nicely, or
to whisper all sorts of droll things to his
neighbors. He was exceedingly good-
natured and gentle in his behavior, but
rather superficial in learning as in his
affections.
	For the fifth form the inspector se</PB>

cured two remarkable men. He en-
tered our classroom, one day, quite ra-
diant, and told us that we should have
a rare chance. Professor Klas6vsky, a
great classical scholar and expert. in
Russian literature, had consented to
teach us Russian grammar, and would
take us through all the five forms in suc-
cession, shifting with us every year to
the next form. Another university pro-
fessor, Herr Becker, librarian of the
imperial (national) library, would do the
same in German. Professor Klas6vsky,
he added, was in weak health that win-
ter, but the inspector was sure that we
would be very quiet in his class. The
chance to have such a teacher was too
good to be missed.
	He had thought aright. We became
very proud of having university profes-
sors for teachers, and although there
came voices from the Kamch~itka (in
Russia, the back benches of each class
bear the name of that remote and unciv-
ilized peninsula) to the effect that the
sausage-maker   that is, the German
 must be kept by all means in obedi-
ence, public opinion in our form was de-
cidedly in favor of the professors.
	The sausage - maker won our re-
spect at once. A tall man, with an im-
mense forehead and very kind, intelli-
gent eyes, not devoid of a touch of hu-
mor, came into our class, and told us
in quite good Russian that he intended to
divide our form into three sections. The
first section would be composed of Ger-
mans, who already knew the language,
and from whom he would require more
serious work; to the second section he
would teach grammar, and later on Ger-
man literature, in accordance with the es-
tablished programmes ; and the third sec-
tion, he concluded with a charming smile,
would be the Kamchi~tka. From you,
he said, I shall only require that at each
lesson you copy four lines which I will
choose for you from a book. The four
lines copied, you can do what you like;
only do not hinder the rest. And I pro-
mise you that iu five years you will learn
something of German and German liter-
ature. Now, who joins the Germans?
You, Stackelberg? You, Lainsdorf?
Perhaps some one of the Russians? And
who joins the Kamch~tka? Five or
six boys, who knew not a word of Ger-
man, took residence in the peninsula.
They most conscientiously copied their
four lines,  a dozen or a score of lines
in the higher forms,  and Becker chose
the lines so well, and bestowed so much
attention~ upon the boys, that by the end
of the five years they really knew some-
thing of the language and its literature.
	I joined the Germans. My brother
Alexander insisted so much in his letters
upon my acquiring German, which pos-
sesses so rich a literature and into which
every book of value is translated, that
I set myself assiduously to learn it. I
translated and studied most thoroughly
one page of a rather difficult poetical de-
scription of a thunderstorm, and learned
by heart, as the professor had advised
me, the conjugations, the adverbs, and
the prepositions, and began to read. A
splendid method it is for learning lan-
guages. Becker advised me, moreover,
to subscribe to a cheap illustrated week-
ly, and its illustrations and short stories
were a continual inducement to read a
few lines or a column. I soon mastered
the language.
	Toward the end of the winter I
asked Herr Becker to lend me a copy
of Goethes Faust. I had read it iu
a Russian translation; I had also read
Turgu6neffs beautiful novel, Faust; and
I now longed to read the great work in
the original. You will understand no-
thing in it; it is too philosophical,
Becker said, with his gentle smile; but
he brought me, nevertheless, a little
square book, with the pages yellowed
by age, containing the immortal drama.
He little knew the unfathomable joy
that that small square book gave mc. I
drank in the sense and the music of
every line of it, beginning with the very</PB>

first verses of the ideally beautiful dedi-
cation, and soon knew full pages by
heart. Fausts monologue in the forest,
and especially the lines in which he
speaks of his understanding of nature,
Thou
Not only cold, amazed acquaintance yieldst,
But grantest that in her profoundest breast
I gaze, as in the bosom of a friend,

simply put me in ecstasy, and till now
it has retained its power over me. Every
verse gradually became a dear friend.
And then, is there a higher a~sthetic de-
light than to read poetry in a language
which one does not yet quite thorough-
ly understand? The whole is veiled
with a sort of slight haze, which admi-
rably suits poetry. Words, the trivial
meaning of which, when one knows the
language colloquially, sometimes inter-
feres with the poetical image they are
intended to convey, retain but their sub-
tle, elevated sense; while the music of
the poetry is only the more strongly im-
pressed upon the ear.

	Professor Klas6vskys first lesson was
a revelation to us. He was a small man,
about fifty years of age, very rapid in
his movements, with bright, intelligent
eyes and a slightly sarcastic expression,
and the high forehead of a poet. When
he came in for his first lesson, he said in
a low voice that, suffering from a pro-
tracted illness, he could not speak loud
enough, and asked us, therefore, to sit
closer to him. He placed his chair near
the first row of tables, and we clustered
round him like a swarm of bees.
	He was to teach us Russian gram-
mar; but, instead of the dull grammar
lesson, we heard something quite dif-
ferent from what we expected. It was
grammar; but here came in a compari-
son of an old Russian folklore expres-
sion with a line from Homer or from
the Sanskrit Mahabharata, the beauty of
which was rendered in Russian words;
there, a verse from Schiller was intro-
duced, and was followed by a sarcastic
	VOL. LXXXII. No. 494.	49
remark about some modern society pre-
judice; then solid grammar again, and
then some wide poetical or philosophical
generalization.
	Of course, there was much in it that
we did not understand, or of which we
missed the deeper sense. But do not
the bewitching powers of all studies lie
in that they continually open up to us
new, unsuspected horizons, not yet un-
derstood, which entice us to proceed fur-
ther and further in the penetration of
what appears in vague outlines, only, at
the first sight? Our hands placed on
one anothers shoulders, some of us lean-
ing across the tables of the first row,
others standing close behind Klas6vsky,
our eyes glittering, we all hung on his
lips. The more his voice fell, toward the
end of the hour, the more breathlessly
we listened. The inspector opened the
door of the classroom, to see how we
behaved with our new teacher; but on
seeing that motionless swarm he retired
on tiptoe. Even Daiiroff, a restless spir-
it, stared at Klas6vsky as if to say,
That is the sort of man you are?
Even von Kleinau, a hopelessly obtuse
Circassian with a German name, sat
motionless. In most of the others some-
thing good and elevated simmered at
the bottom of their hearts, as if a vision
of an unsuspected world was opening
before them. Upon me Klas6vsky had
an immense influence, which only grew
with years. Winklers prophecy, that,
after all, I might like the school, was
fulfilled.
	In western Europe, and probably in
America, that type of teacher  the
teacher of literature  is unknown;
but in Russia there is not a man or
woman of mark, in literature or in polit-
ical life, who does not owe the first im-
pulse toward a higher development to
his or her teacher of literature. Every
school in the world ought to have such
a teacher. Each teacher in a school has
his own subject, and there is no link be-
tween the different subjects. Only the</PB>

teacher of literature, guided by the gen-
eral outlines of the programme, but left
free to treat it as he likes, can bind to-
gether the separate historical and hu-
manitarian sciences that are taught in
a school, unify theni by a broad philo-
sophical and humane conception, and
awaken higher ideas and inspirations in
the brains and hearts of the young peo-
ple. In Russia, that necessary task falls
quite naturally upon the teacher of Rus-
sian literature. As he speaks of the
development of the language, of the
contents of the early epic poetry, of
popular songs and music, and, later on,
of modern fiction, of the scientific, polit-
ical, and philosophical literature of his
own country, and the divers ~sthetical,
political, and philosophical currents it has
reflected, lie is bound to introduce that
generalized conception of the develop-
ment of human mind which lies beyond
the scope of each of the subjects that
are taught separately.
	The same thing ought to be done for
the natural sciences as well. It is not
enough to teach physics and chemistry,
astronomy and meteorology, zo~Aogy and
botany. The philosophy of all the natu-
ral sciences  a general view of nature
as a whole, something on the lines of
the first volume of Humboldts Cosmos
 must be conveyed to the pupils and
the students, whatsoever may be the ex-
tension given to the study of the natural
sciences in the school. The philosophy
and the poetry of nature, the methods of
all the exact sciences, and an inspired
conception of the life of nature must
make part of education. Perhaps the
teacher of geography might provision-
ally assume this function; but then we
should require quite a different set of
teachers of this subject, and a different
set of professors of geography iii the uni-
versities would be needed. What is now
taught under this name is anything you
like, but it is not geography.
uproarious form in a quite different
manner. It was the teacher of writing,
the last one of the teaching staff. If
the heathen  that is, the German
and the French teachers  were regard-
ed with little respect, the teacher of
writing, Ebert, who was a German Jew,
was a real martyr. To be insolent with
him was a sort of chic amongst the
pages. His poverty alone must have
been the reason why lie kept to his les-
son in our corps. The old hands, who
had stayed for two or three years in the
fifth form without moving higher up,
treated him very badly; but by some
means or other he had made an agree-
ment with them One frolic during
each lesson, but no more,  an agree-
ment which, I am afraid, was iiot always
honestly kept on our side.
	One day, one of the residents of the
remote peninsula soaked the blackboard
sponge with ink and chalk and flung it
at the cahigraphy martyr. Get it,
Ebert! he shouted, with a stupid smile.
The sponge touched Ebcrts shoulder,
glanced into his face and down on his
white shirt, covering both with ink and
chalk.
	All saw it, and were sure that this
time Ebert would leave the room and
report the fact to the inspector. But
he only exclaimed, as lie took out his
cotton handkerchief and wiped his face,
Gentlemen, one frolic,  no more to-
day ! The shirt is spoiled, he add-
ed in a subdued voice, and continued to
correct some ones book.
	We looked stupefied and ashamed.
Why, instea(l of reporting, lie had thought
at once of the agreement! All feelings
turned in his favor. What you have
done is stupid, we reproached our com-
rade. He is a poor juan, and you have
spoiled his shirt! Shame!  somebody
cried.
	The culprit went at once to make ex-
cuses. One must learn, was all that
Ebert said in reply, with sadness in his

	All became silent after that, and at
the next lesson, as if we had settled it be-
forehand, many of us wrote in our best
possible handwriting, and took our books
to Ebert, asking him to correct them.
He was radiant; he felt happy that day.
	This fact deeply impressed me, and
was never wiped out from my memory.
To this day I feel grateful to that re-
markable man for his lesson.

	With our teacher of drawing, who was
named Ganz, we never came to live on
good terms. He continually reported
those who played in his class. This, in
our opinion, lie had no right to do, be-
cause he was only a teacher of draw-
ing, but especially because he was not an
honest man. In the class he paid little
attention to most of us, and spent his
time in improving the drawings of those
who took private lessons from him, or
paid him in order to show at the exami-
nations a good drawing and to get a
good mark for it. Against those com-
rades who did so we had no grudge. On
the contrary, we thought it quite right
that those who had no capacity for
mathematics or no memory for geogra-
phy, and had but poor marks in these
subjects, should improve their total of
marks by ordering from a draughtsman
a drawing or a topographical map for
which they would get a full twelve.
Only for the first two pupils of the form
it would not have been fair to resort to
such means, while the remainder could
do it with untroubled consciences. But
the teacher had no business to make
drawings to order; and if he chose to
act in this way, he ought to bear with
resignation the noise an(l the tricks of his
pupils. That was our ethics. Instead of
this, no lesson passe(l without his lodging
complaints, and each time he grew more
arrogant.
	As soon as we were moved to the
fourth form, and felt ourselves natural-
ized citizens of the corps, we decided to
tighten the bridle upon him. It is
your own fault, our elder comrades told
us, that he takes such airs with you;
we used to keep him in obedience. So
we decided to bring him into subjec-
tion.
	One day, two excellent comrades of
our form approached Ganz with cigar-
ettes in their mouths, and asked him to
oblige them with a light. Of course,
that was only meant for a joke,  no one
ever thonght of smoking in the class-
rooms, and, according to our rules of
propriety, Ganz had merely to send the
two boys away; but he inscribed them
in the journal, and they were severely
punished. That was the last drop. We
decided to give him a benefit night.
That meant that one day all the form,
provided with rulers borrowed from the
upper forms, would start an outrageous
noise by striking the rulers against the
tables, and send the teacher out of the
class. However, the plot offered many
difficulties. We had in our form a lot
of goody  boys who would promise to
join in the demonstration, but at the last
moment would grow nervous and draw
back, and then the teacher would name
the others. In such enterprises unanim-
ity is the first requisite, because the pun.
ishment, whatsoever it may be, is always
lighter when it falls on the whole class
instead of on a few.
	The difficulties were overcome with a
truly Machiavellian craft. At a given sig-
nal all were to turn their backs to Ganz,
and then, with the rulers laid in readiness
in the desks of the next row, they would
produce the required noise. In this way
the goody boys would not feel terrified
at Ganzs staring at them. Bnt the sig-
nal ? Whistling, as in robbers tales,
shouting, or even sneezing would not do:
Ganz would be capable of naming any
one of us as having whistled or sneezed.
The signal must be a silent one. One of
us, who drew nicely, would take his draw-
ing to show it to Ganz, and the moment
he returned and took his seat,  that
should be the time!</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00778" SEQ="0778" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="772">772 The Autobiography

	All went on admirably. Nes~doff
took up his drawing, and Ganz corrected
it in a few minutes, which seemed to us
an eternity. He returned at last to his
seat; he stopped for a moment, looking
at us; he sat down. . . . All the form
turned suddenly on their seats, and the
rulers rattled merrily within the desks,
while some of us shouted amidst the noise,
Ganz out! Down with him! The
noise was deafening; all the forms knew
that Ganz had got his benefit night. He
stood there, murmuring something, and
finally went out. An officer ran in, 
the noise continued; then the sub-inspec-
tor dashed in, and after him the inspec-
tor. The noise stopped at once. Scold-
ing began.
	The elder under arrest at once!
the inspector commanded; and I, who
was the first in the form, and conse-
quently the elder, was marched to the
black cell. That spared me seeing what
followed. The director came; Ganz was
asked to name the ringleaders, but he
could name nobody. They all turned
their backs to me, and began the noise,
was his reply. Thereupon the form was
taken downstairs, and although flogging
had been completely abandoned in our
school, this time the two who had been
reported because they asked for a light
were flogged with the birch rod, under
the pretext that the benefit night was a
revenge for their punishment.
	I learned this ten days later, when I
was allowed to return to the class. My
name, which had been inscribed on the
red board in the class, was wiped off. To
this I was indifferent; but I must con-
fess that the ten days in the cell, without
books, seemed to me rather long, so that
I composed (in horrible verses) a poem,
in which the deeds of the fourth form
were duly glorified.
	Of course, our form became now the
heroes of the school. For a month or so
we had to tell and retell all about the af-
fair to the other forms, and received con-
gratulations for having managed it with
of a Revolutionist.

such unanimity that nobody was caught
separately. And then came the Sun-
days  all the Sundays down to Christ-
mas  that the form had to remain at
the school, not being allowed to go home.
Being all kept together, we managed to
make those Sundays very gay. The
mammas of the goody boys brought them
heaps of sweets; those who had some
money spent it generously, and moun-
tains of pastry  substantial before din-
ner, and sweet after it  were absorbed,
while in the evenings the friends from
the other forms smuggled in quantities
of fruit for the brave fourth form.
	Ganz gave up inscribing any one; but
drawing was totally lost for us. No one
wanted to learn drawing from that mer-
cenary man.
III.

	My brother Alexander was at that time
at Moscow, in a corps of cadets, and we
maintained a lively correspondence. As
long as I was at home that would have
been impossible, because our father con-
sidered it his prerogative to read all let-
ters addressed to our house; he would
have soon put an end to any but a com-
monplace correspondence. Now we were
free to discuss in our letters whatever we
liked. The only difficulty was to get
money for stamps; but we soon learned
to write in such fine characters that we
could convey an incredible amount of
matter in each letter. Alexander, whose
handwriting was beautiful, contrived to
get four printed pages on one single page
of note paper, and his microscopic lines
were as legible as the best small type
print. It is a pity that these letters,
which he kept as precious relics, have
disappeared. The states police, dur-
ing one of their raids, robbed him even
of these treasures.
	Our first letters were mostly about the
petty things of my new surroundings, but
our correspondence soon took a more
serious chara~cter. My brother could not
write about trifles. Even in society he
became animated only when some sen</PB>

ous discussion was engaged in, and he
complained of feeling a dull pain in
the brain  a physical pain, as he used
to say  when he was with people who
cared only for small talk. He was very
much in advance of me in his intellect-
ual development, and all the time he
urged me forward, raising new scientific
and philosophical questions one after an-
other, and advising me what to read or
to study. What a happiness it was for
me to have such a brother!  a brother
who, moreover, loved me passionately.
To him I owe the best part of my de-
velopment.
	Sometimes he would advise inc to
read poetry, and would send me in his
letters quantities of verses and whole
poems, which he wrote from memory.
Read poetry, he wrote: poetry makes
men better. How often, in my after
life, I realized the truth of this remark
of his! Read poetry: it makes men
better. He himself was a poet, and had
a wonderful facility for writing most mu-
sical verses; indeed, I think it a great
pity that he abandoned poetry. The
reaction against art, which arose among
the Russian youth in the early sixties,
and which Turgu6neff has depicted in
Bazi~roff (Fathers and Sons), induced
him to look upon his verses with con-
tempt, and to plunge headlong into the
natural sciences. I must say, however,
that my favorite poet was none of those
whom his poetical gift, his musical ear,
and his philosophical turn of mind made
him like best. His favorite Russian
poet was Yenevftinoff, while mine was
Nekr~soff, whose verses were very often
unmusical, but appealed most to my heart
by their sympathy for the downtrodden
and offended.
	One must have a set purpose in his
life, he wrote me once. Without an
aim, without a purpose, life is not life.
And he advised me to get a purpose in
my life worth living for. I was too
young then to find one; but something
undetermined, vague, good altogether,
already rose under that appeal, even
though I could not say what that good
would be.
	Our father gave us very little spend-
ing money, and I never had any to buy a
single book; but if Alexander got a few
rubles from some aunt, he never spent a
penny of it for pleasure, but bought a
book and sent it to me. He objected,
though, to indiscriminate reading. One
must have some question, he wrote, ad-
dressed to the book lie is going to read.
However, I did not then appreciate this
remark, and cannot think now without
amazement of the number of books, often
of a quite special character, which I read,
in all branches, but particularly in the
domain of history. I did not waste my
time upon French novels, since Alexan-
der, years before, had characterized them
in one blunt sentence: They are stupid
and full of bad language.
	The great questions concerning the
conception we should form of the uni-
verse  our Welt anschauung, as the
Germans say  were, of course, the domi-
nant subjects in our correspondence. In
our childhood we had never been reli-
gious. We were taken to church; but in
a Russian church, in a small parish or in
a village, the solemn attitude of the peo-
ple is far more impressive than the mass
itself. Of all that I ever had heard in
church only two things had impressed
me: the twelve passages from the Gos-
pels, relative to the sufferings of the
Christ, which are read in Russia at the
night service on the eve of Good Friday,
and the short prayer condemning the
spirit of domination, which is recited dur-
ing the Great Lent, and is really beau-
tiful by reason of its simple, unpreten-
tious words and feeling. P4shkin has
rendered it into Russian verse.
	Later on, at St. Petersburg, I went
several times to aRoman Catholic church,
but the theatrical character of the ser-
vice and the absence of real feeling in it
shocked me, the more so when I saw
there with what simple faith some re~</PB>

tired Polish soldier or a peasant woman
would pray in a remote corner. I also
went to a Protestant church; but com-
ing out of it I caught myself murmuring
Goethes words 
But you will never link hearts together
Unless the linking springs from your own
heart.

	Alexander, in the meantime, had em-
braced with his usual passion the Lu-
theran faith. He had read Michelets
book on Servetus, and had worked out
for himself a religion on the lines of that
great fighter. He studied with enthusi-
asmn the Augsburg declaration, which he
copied out and sent me, and our letters
now became full of discussions about
grace, and of texts from the apostles
Paul and James. I followed my brother,
but theologic~d discussions did not deeply
interest me. Since I had recovered from
the typhoid fever I had taken to quite
different reading.
	Our sister H6kne, who was now mar-
ried, was at St. Petersburg, and every
Saturday night I went to visit her. Her
husband had a good library, in which the
French philosophers of the last century
and the modern French historians were
well represented, and I plunged into
them. Such books were prohibited in
Russia, and evidently could not be taken
to school; so I spent most of the night,
every Saturday, in reading the works
of tim encyclop~edists, the philosophical
dictionary of Voltaire, the writings of
the Stoics, especially Marcus Aurelius,
and so on. The infinite immensity of
the universe, the greatness of nature, its
poetry, its ever throbbing life, impressed
me more and more; and that never
ceasing life and its harmonies gave me
the ecstasy of admiration which the
young soul thirsts for, while my favor-
ite poets supplied me with an expres-
sion in words of that awakening love of
mankind and faith in its progress which
make the best part of youth and impress
man for all his life.
	Alexander, by this time, had gradual-
ly come to a Kantian agnosticism, and
the relativity of perceptions, per-
ceptions in time and space, and time
only, and so on, filled pages and pages
in our letters, the writing of which be-
came more and more microscopical as
the subjects under discussion grew in im-
portance. But neither then nor later
on, when we used to spend hours and
hours in discussing Kants philosophy,
could my brother convert me to become
a disciple of the K~inigsberg philoso-
pher.
	Natural sciences  that is, mathemat-
ics, physics, and astronomy  were my
chief studies. In the year 1858, before
Darwin had brought out his immortal
work, a professor of zotilogy at the
Moscow University, Roulier, published
three lectures on transformism, and my
brother took up at once his ideas con-
cerning the variability of species. He
was not satisfied, however, with approx-
mmat&#38; proofs only, and began to study
a number of special books on heredity
and the like; communicating to me in
his letters the main facts, as well as his
ideac and his doubts. The appearance of
The Origin of Species did not settle his
doubts on several special points, but only
raised new questions and gave him the
impulse for further studies. We after-
ward discussed  and that discussion
lasted for many years  various ques-
tions relative to the origin of variations,
their chances of being transmitted and
being accentuated ; in short, those ques-
tions which have been raised quite lately
in the Weismaun-Spencer controversy, in
Galtons researches, and in the works of
the modern Neo-Lamarckians. Owing
to his philosophical and critical mind,
Alexander had noticed at once the fun-
damental importance of these questions
for the theory of variability of species,
even though they were so often over-
looked then by many naturalists.
	I must also mention a temporary cx-
cursion into the domain of political eco-
nomy. In the years 1858 and 1859 every</PB>

one in Russia spoke of political econo-
my; lectures on free trade and protec-
tive duties attracted crowds of people,
and my brother, who was not yet ab-
sorbed l)y the variability of species, took
a lively though temporary interest in
economical matters, sending me for
reading the Political Economy of Jean
Baptiste Say. I read a few chapters
only: tariffs and banking operations did
not interest me in the least; but Alex-
ander took up these matters so passkn.
ately that he even wrote letters to our
stepmother, trying to interest her in the
intricacies of the customs duties. Later
on, in Siberia, as we were re-reading
some of the letters of that period, we
laughed like children when we fell upon
one of his epistles in which he coal-
plained of our stepmothers incapacity
to be moved even by such burning ques-
tions, and raged against a greengrocer
whom he had caught in the street, and
who, would you believe it, he wrote
with signs of exclamation, although
he was a tradesman, affected a pig-head-
ed indifference to tariff matters!

	Every summer about one half of the
pages were taken to a military camp,
with the other military schools, at Pc-
terhof. The lower forms, however, were
dispensed from joining the camp, and I
spent the first two summers at Nik6l-
skoye. To leave the school, to take the
train to Moscow, and there to meet Al-
exander was such a happy prospect that
I used to count the days that had to pass
till that glorious one should arrive. But
on one occasion a great disappointment
awaited me at Moscow. Alexander had
not passed his examinations, and was left
for another year in the same form. He
was, in fact, too young to enter the spe-
cial classes; but our father was very an-
gry with him, nevertheless, and would
not permit us to see each other. I felt
very sad. We were not children any
more, and had so much to say to each
other. I tried to obtain permission to

go to our aunt Sulima, at whose house I
might meet Alexander, but it was abso-
lutely refused. After our father remar-
ried we were never allowed to see our
mothers relations.
	That spring our Moscow house was
full of guests. Every night the recep-
tion rooms were flooded with lights, the
band played, the confectioner was busy
making ices and pasti-y, and card-play-
ing went on in the great hall till a late
hour. I strolled aimlessly about in the
brilliantly illuminated rooms, and felt un-
happy.
	One night, after ten, a servant beck-
oned me, asking if I would come out to
the entrance hail. I went. Come to
the coachmens house, the old major.
domo Frol whispered to me. Alexan-
der Alex6ievich is here.
	I dashed across the yard, up the flight
of steps leading to the coachmens house,
and into a wide, half-dark room, where,
at the immense dining-table of the ser-
vants, I saw Alexander.
	S~sha, dear, how did you come?
and in a moment we rushed into each
others arms, hugging each other and un-
able to speak from emotion.
Hush, hush! they may overhear
you, said the servants cook, Prask6-
via, wiping away her tears with her
apron. Poor orphans! If your mo-
ther were only alive 
Old Frol stood, his head deeply bent,
his eyes also twinkling.
	Look here, P6tya, not a word to
any one; to no one, he said, while Pm-
sk6via placed on the table an enrthen-
ware jar full of porridge for Alexan-
der.
	He, glowing with health, in his cadet
uniform, already had begun to talk
about all sorts of mattei-s, while he rap-
idly emptied the pormidge pot. I could
hardly make him tell me how he came
there at such a late hour. We lived then
near the Smol6nsky boulevard, within a
stones throw of the house where our
mother died, and the corps of cadets</PB>

was at the opposite outskirts of Moscow,
full five miles away.
	He had made a doll out of bedclothes,
and had put it in his bed, under the
blankets; then he went to the tower, de-
scended from a window, came out unno-
ticed, and walked the whole distance.
	Were you not afraid at night, in the
deserted fields round your corps? I
asked.
	What had I to fear? Only lots of
dogs were upon me; I had teased them
myself. To - morrow I shall take my
sword with me.
	The coachmen and other servants
came in and out; they sighed as they
looked at us, and took seats at a dis-
tance, along the walls, exchanging words
in a subdued tone, so as not to disturb
us; while we two, in each others arms,
sat there till midnight, talking about
nebuhe and Laplaces hypothesis, the
structure of matter, the struggles of the
papacy under Boniface VIII. with the
imperial power, and so on.
	From time to time one of the servants
would hurriedly run in, saying, P&#38; 
tinka, go and show thyself in the hall;
they may ask for thee.

night; but he came, nevertheless,  not
without having had a scrimmage with the
dogs, against whom he had taken his
sword. I responded with feverish haste,
when, earlier than the day before, I
was called once more to the coachmens
house. Stfsha had made part of the
journey in a cab. The previous night,
one of the servants had brought him what
he had got from the card-players and
asked him to take it. S~sha took some
small coin to hire a cab, and so he came
earlier than on his first visit.
	He intended to come next night, too,
but for some reason it would have been
dangerous for the servants, and we de-
cided to part till the autumn. A short
official  note made me understand next
day that his nocturnal escapades had
passed unnoticed. How terrible would
have been the punishment, if they had
been discovered! It is awful to think
of it: flogging before the corps till he was
carried away unconscious on a sheet, and

times.

THE LANDSCAPE AS A MEANS OF CULTURE.

	THE habits of civilized life tend to
separate men from the charm of the
world about them. The insistent ac-
tivities which are the price of success,
in the effort to win the harvests of an
immediately profitable kind, fix the at-
tention on certain limited fields of the
environment, and necessarily exclude all
recognition of the larger features of na-
ture. Thus, the noble aspects of the
sky, in the changes from dawn to dark,
and from storm to fair weather, count
to most of us only as the conditions of
our occupations or our diversions; in
themselves, they are quite without con-
sideration. This is no new state of
man; indeed, by the demands of econo-
mic life, the primitive savage and the
barbarian have ordinarily followed in
the path of the prehuman species whence
they came, giving no more heed to the
scenes about them than their needs
called for. Now and then, in moments
of poetic exaltation, the beauty of the
natural realm has forced itself on their
attention, but only the rarer spirits see
that there is here a great field to be
won for the profit of man. The art of
appropriating the landscape is not a lost
art, but one which is yet to be invented
and applied to the profit of our kind.
It is likely to be a long time before we
acquire the habit of atten(ling to the ex-
pression of the world about us as we do
to that of the human countenance.
	It is evident that our culture is near
the station where we may hope for some
effort to develop the landscape sense by
a systematic training in the arts which
may enable us to appreciate scenery.
Such a training may be regarded as a
fitting supplement of that which we
now devote to the purely scientific as-
pects of nature. It is likely that the
task would long ago have been essayed
in our American schools, where any pe
dagogic novelty commends itself, but
for the evident difficulty of devising a
fit system by which it can be done.
The trouble is that the appreciation of
scenic beauty is like the poetic sense, or
the other sympathetic movements of the
spirit, not only without the field of or-
dinary teaching, but quite beyond the
reach of its methods. Every part of the
movement which is required must come
from within. Something can doubtless
be done to favor the development of the
landscape motive by the proper use of
such literature as presents the beauties
of nature in a way to awaken the emo-
tions; something also by practice in
sketching, or in describing actual or pic-
tured scenes. Still, the effective impulse
must come from within.
	To those who would develop their
sensibility to natural beauty, the teacher
can be most helpful by telling the ex-
periences he has had in the development
of his sympathy with the external world.
In my own case, these tokens are not
many. Their value is uncertain, for the
reason that minds differ incalculably in
their modes of action. Ways of looking
at nature which may lead one to rich
harvests may beguile another into desert
places. Moreover, it is not easy even

THE LANDSCAPE AS A MEANS OF CULTURE.

	THE habits of civilized life tend to
separate men from the charm of the
world about them. The insistent ac-
tivities which are the price of success,
in the effort to win the harvests of an
immediately profitable kind, fix the at-
tention on certain limited fields of the
environment, and necessarily exclude all
recognition of the larger features of na-
ture. Thus, the noble aspects of the
sky, in the changes from dawn to dark,
and from storm to fair weather, count
to most of us only as the conditions of
our occupations or our diversions; in
themselves, they are quite without con-
sideration. This is no new state of
man; indeed, by the demands of econo-
mic life, the primitive savage and the
barbarian have ordinarily followed in
the path of the prehuman species whence
they came, giving no more heed to the
scenes about them than their needs
called for. Now and then, in moments
of poetic exaltation, the beauty of the
natural realm has forced itself on their
attention, but only the rarer spirits see
that there is here a great field to be
won for the profit of man. The art of
appropriating the landscape is not a lost
art, but one which is yet to be invented
and applied to the profit of our kind.
It is likely to be a long time before we
acquire the habit of atten(ling to the ex-
pression of the world about us as we do
to that of the human countenance.
	It is evident that our culture is near
the station where we may hope for some
effort to develop the landscape sense by
a systematic training in the arts which
may enable us to appreciate scenery.
Such a training may be regarded as a
fitting supplement of that which we
now devote to the purely scientific as-
pects of nature. It is likely that the
task would long ago have been essayed
in our American schools, where any pe
dagogic novelty commends itself, but
for the evident difficulty of devising a
fit system by which it can be done.
The trouble is that the appreciation of
scenic beauty is like the poetic sense, or
the other sympathetic movements of the
spirit, not only without the field of or-
dinary teaching, but quite beyond the
reach of its methods. Every part of the
movement which is required must come
from within. Something can doubtless
be done to favor the development of the
landscape motive by the proper use of
such literature as presents the beauties
of nature in a way to awaken the emo-
tions; something also by practice in
sketching, or in describing actual or pic-
tured scenes. Still, the effective impulse
must come from within.
	To those who would develop their
sensibility to natural beauty, the teacher
can be most helpful by telling the ex-
periences he has had in the development
of his sympathy with the external world.
In my own case, these tokens are not
many. Their value is uncertain, for the
reason that minds differ incalculably in
their modes of action. Ways of looking
at nature which may lead one to rich
harvests may beguile another into desert
places. Moreover, it is not easy even
for those who are accustomed to intro-
spection to gain an adequate notion of
how their states of mind are induced.
Therefore I will limit the suggestions to
points which lie well in the field of my
individual experience and that of others
who have helped me with theirs.
	The first of all the mental arts which
the student of the landscape needs to
acquire is that of contemplation,  the
calm, affectionate forthgoing to the en-
vironment which permits the scene to
enter in its fullness to the understanding
and to sink quietly therein. Until this
way of beholding is established, the</PB>

mind can do no more than snatch frag-
mentary impressions of the scene, which
may gratify the curiosity or awaken
the pleasure of surprise, but have no
relation to the higher ~sthetic sense.
Few persons in this day develop any
capacity for the contemplative mood, 
it has indeed been rare in all days; but
our time, with its crowding of people
and interests, with its almost fiendish
sense of duty by the moment, makes
against the motive in a disastrously ef-
fective way. He who would acquire
this, the very foundation of all msthetic
sense, must be prepared to set himself
against the spirit of his age.
	The contemplative attitude demands
solitude, or at least a mental isolation
from our fellow men. In this it is like
the kindred poetic motive, which acts
only when the mind is isolated. The iso-
lation, indeed, in both these movements
of the spirit, has to be so complete that
self-consciousness is banished before the
needed solitude is won. Therefore he
who would become a lover of the land-
scape must accustom himself to seek it
alone, and must learn to know that his
mere presence at its doors will not make
him free to its treasures. He must come
to them as a worshiper, and with the
spirit of devotion which befits a temple.
	He who really seeks the landscape
will surely find that he possesses a pro-
fitable remnant of the natural affection
for the outer world that belongs in the
spirit of men, but which our unhappy
methods of education and of living so
tend to wear away. If he has never
set himself before a scene with the in-
tention of winning all that he can gain
from it, he is certain to find his first
essay rather unprofitable. He will find
himself in the tourists frame of mind,
with the additional hamper of the self-
consciousness which attends any such
experiment. His first task is to make
himself familiar with the view, so that
lie may feel at home in it, so that all
mere surprise is cleared away. With
years of training, he will be able quickly
to enter on this friendly relation with a
landscape, but to the novice the relation
comes slowly; lie may have to look again
and again before lie can begin to feel its
true charm. The best plan for him is
to see the place from the same point of
view, and under the same conditions of
hour and sky, day after day, until it be-
comes something like his own property.
	Although the contemplative attitude
may seem to those who know little
about it to be one of indolent repose,
it really demands all the strength the
mind gives to intellectual labor. It is
quite as taxing as any other form of
such work. Therefore those who would
view a landscape aright must see to it
that they have nervous energy at their
command, as they are accustomed to
have it when they need to use their minds
in full measure. Hurriedly to seek a
view after hard climbing and in dis-
comfort is no more reasonable than it
would be to make a like preparation for
other absorbing mental work. On this
account it is worth the observers while
to see to his condition, when he would
appreciate a landscape, even as carefully
as lie would do in preparation for hear-
ing music.
	At the beginning of his study of land-
scapes, the observer learns that all scenes
have one point of view which is for him
the best, though it may not be for an-
other. From that station the effects-
are evidently most harmonious,  fit-
ting to his previously acquired motives.
Therefore a certain reconnoitring of the
ground is required before one deter-
mines just how one shall face the vista.
Practice will in time enable the observer
almost instinctively to come upon the
point where the field can be best read;
he will form the habit of looking at the
landscape as lie has formed that of
reading the printed page, limiting his
attention to the few characters which
lie need have in eye and mind in order
to go swiftly forward with the im4erpre-</PB>

tation. In the larger record of the
field, as in the smaller of the print,
habit must guide in this necessary limi-
tation of the attention, and in its mea-
sured ongoing from one passage to an-
other. It is important that this habit
be rationally formed, for on its guid-
aiice depends success in approaching
the beautiful in nature. The applica-
tion is, indeed, much wider; it includes
the scientific as well as the ~esthetic con-
tact with the world about us. Answers
come only to our interrogations; the su-
preme art is that of questioning.
	Perhaps the commonest blunder, in
looking upon the landscape, is found in
the effort to take in at once all that a wide
field contains. The tourists usual en-
deavor is to climb some hill, the higher
the better for his desire, whence he can
have a panorama including the larg~st
possible number of peaks, lakes, and
towns within the bewildering circle of
the horizon. He willingly climbs for
another half day to double his catalogue
of telescopic objects. It is not too much
to say that to approach the landscape in
this way is to insure immunity from any
spiritual contact with it. There may be
creatures in other solar systems so organ-
ized that they can appropriate a panora-
ma. If such there are, their minds must
hav~ other qualities than ours have.
They must have eyes on every side, so
that they are exempt from the sense of
before and behind which is one of the
limitations of mans nature. With our-
selves, this sense is a part of the stock
inherited from our ancestors, man and
brute alike; it is dominating in all our
relations to the surrounding world;
along with that of up and down, it
rules our feelings in all our contacts
with the environment.
	If the observer has attained to some
skill in approaching a landscape, he will
be conscious of a certain measure of dis-
comfort whenever he is forced to attend to
a circular view; the portion of the vista
which he feels to be behind him, or too
far on either side to receive due atten-
tion, is in a way discomforting. Acting
on this suggestion afforded by the unea-
siness aroused by a panorama, the obser-
ver will find it profitable to make some
experiments to determine the most ad-
vantageous limits of a view; these limits
appear to vary within a rather narrow
range with different persons and per-
haps in different stages of training in the
landscape art. The easiest way in which
to make the essay is by looking at a wide
and attractive view through a doorway
or a window, where there is no obstruc-
tion from the sashes. Beginning the
test from a point so near the opening
that its margins do not force themselves
upon the eye, the observer should note,
as well as he can, the measure of satis-
faction which he receives from the be-
holding. This, if his experience is the
same as that of the writer and of those
who have tried like experiments for him,
will be qualified by the fact that the
vision cannot take in anything like as
wide an angle as is offered to it. The
view, in a word, is not one, but many,
for the eyes have to turn in order to
compass it. When this first impres-
sion has been gained, another should be
sought at a distance back from the open-
ing which will make its margins come
in to limit the field of view, so that all
the scene can, in a way, be compassed
with one setting of the eyes. At a
certain point on the reduction in the
angle, the observer will find that with
the particular view he obtains the max-
imum of satisfaction.
	The above described experiment,
though apparently simple, is not alto-
gether easy of trial, for the reason that
the observer must have a certain capa-
city for valuing his impressions, such
as is not commonly attained without a
good deal of training in the art of see-
ing. With most persons the trial of the
method appears to show that there is
a distinct increase i~ the ~sthetic value
as the angle is diminished from say</PB>

ninety degrees to about fifteen degrees
or less. Much, however, depends upon
the nature of the view: one in which
the features are simple and there are
few details which demand attention per-
mits a wider lateral range than another
where the notable details are numerous
and closely interrelated. In general, the
more the scene has to give, the narrower
the range of vision which can profitably
be applied to it.
	Without resorting to deliberate ex-
periment, which may be held as rather
out of place in ~sthetic inquiry, the ob-
server can gain a fair idea of the prin-
ciple that I have laid down, and at the
same time determine his capacity for
taking in a view, by noting his daily ex-
perience in the scenes which offer them-
selves to his eyes. When the houses of
a street terminate in a manner to open
a pleasing field, he can, as he walks to-
ward the expanse, find the point where
the vista is most satisfactory. Repeat-
ing the trial from day to day, he will
perhaps be able to judge whether his
sensibility to the landscape is sufficient-
ly keen to afford him a basis for judg-
ment; if not, he has not beconie quick-
ened to such perceptions. He has yet
to make his novitiate.
	Another observation, which serves to
illustrate the limitation which needs to
be put on the range of vision in order to
obtain the best effect, may be made
when we look upon a great building. In
such viewing, because of the necessary
concentration of the attention on details
of form and proportion, the suitable
angle to be included by the eyes is much
smaller than in beholding a wide land-
scape where the features are of a broader
nature. The scope fitted to give an im-
pression of a building is probably not
over five degrees; in the appreciation of
details of architecture it is yet less. As
a general statement it may be said that
the closest observation in vision, such as
we give to a single small object, requires
that there shall be practically no angle
of divergence to the boundaries of the
field. As the field is widened, the mea-
sure of attention given to any part of it is
diminished, until at a certain point in the
increase the eyes have to be turned and
readjusted to another set of impressions.
This change is instinctively made when-
ever the sense of interest in the margins
of the visual area is aroused, without the
perception being clear enough to satisfy
the demands of the mind. When this
change is made, the second view is in part
superimposed on the first, and the pano-
ramic method of observation is begun,
with a resulting loss of a~sthetic value.
	If the reader has never criticised his
ways of looking at the landscape, he will
be likely to think that there can be no
great difference in the mental result aris-
ing from the mere shifting of the eyes in
the process of compassing a view. The
shortest answer to this suggestion is the
advice to try the experiment. He will
perceive, after his essay, that his atten-
tion is distracted by the change, and
that he has diminished the effectiveness
of the impression. The conditions are
much the same as those we meet in be-
holding pictures. We all know that a
painting, especially if it be a landscape,
is most advantageously seen alone; not
in a gallery, but where its effect is not
overlaid by that of others, however~ like
in motive. The only canvases which
the writer vividly remembers are those
seen under such circumstances, though
the value of these works has not been as
great as that of others exhibited in large
collections. With such, the effect of the
successive impressions may destroy all
the iesthetic value of the noblest art.
The analogy of the mind to a sensitive
photographic plate, whereon one impres-
sion destroys another, though too me-
chanical for the exact tr~ith, presents
fairly enough the results of overlaying
one mental image with another.
	The sum of this plea for a singleness
of impression in the effort to obtain the
full aisthetic value of the landscape may</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00787" SEQ="0787" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="781">The Landscape as a ilfeans of Culture.	781

be stated in a few words. It is that
panoramic or even wide-angled seeing,
while it gratifies the curiosity, is destruc-
tive to all valuable effects so far as the
sense of beauty is concerned. The im-
pression gained is distinct and powerful
by virtue of its limitation so long as the
boundaries are not so narrow that they
chafe the understanding; it is strong in
proportion to its repetition from the same
point of view and under the same con-
ditions of air and light.
	The next consideration for the student
of the landscape to note is the relation
between the purely intellectual or ra-
tional interest he may find or introduce
into a view and the a~sthetic impression
which he seeks to gain from it. It is easi-
ly made clear to those who in any mea-
sure share in the scientific and the spir-
itual motives of interpreting nature, that
good as these motives are in themselves,
and effectively as they may be made to
stimulate and reinforce one another in
the general economy of the mind, they
cannot at any one time be profitably as-
sociated. They are, indeed, so far antag-
onistic as to be mutually destructive in
all but their ultimate purpose,  the com-
prehension of nature. The task of the
iesthetic sympathies is to take the data
which consciousness presents,  things
seen as well as remoter knowledge, 
and combine these impressions in the
ideal realm so that they awaken the con-
structive imagination and extend the po-
etic fancy to the utmost. While thus act-
ing, the mind, though advantageously it
may use all its store of knowledge in
building its baseless fabrics of a vi-
sion, cares for no rules; construction is
in large measure and necessarily emanci-
pated from the control of facts.
	There can be no doubt that knowledge
may vastly enhance the intensity of ies-
thetic impressions. There are many
landscapes in the unhistoric wilder-
nesses, endowed with a far greater share
ol purely natural beauty than that of the
Val dAriio or of the plain of Marathon.
It is the light from the past which gives
these scenes their abiding dignity; but
this light does not shine forth from the
pages of the guidebook; it must come
from the ancient wealth of the mind.
Therefore, the student who would make
himself ready to bi-ing all the value of
the landscape before his spiritual under-
standing must be prepared to gain his
knowledge of a scene some time before
he seeks to turn it over to his fancy, 
long enough before to have the facts be-
come so well organized in the memory
that they come forth unconsciously and
without command. Otherwise, fancy, the
most independent of all his powers, will
deny them any place in her creations.
	In beginning the study of landscapes,
the novice will find it necessary slowly
to acquire all the knowledge which en-
ters into the imaginative impression the
scene is to yield him. The evidence of
the slow changes which have brought the
bit of earth to its existing form, which
have shaped the face which it turns to
the eyes of man, has to be gained by de-
liberate inquiry, so that the reading is
as that of a great volume in its difficul-
ty and in the time it demands. This
stage will pass with the increase in
knowledge, and of skill in selecting from
that knowledge the little yet precious
share which may be used by the imagi-
nation in its constructive work. So, at
least, it is true as regards the details of
scientific fact. It is otherwise as re-
gards the more general conceptions
which relate to the application of the
natural forces to the earth, and the larger
results arising therefrom. Such truths
are in their very essence so far poetic
that, to the discerning eye, they shine
with its light even in the grim frame-
work of a mathematical proposition. On
an ocean-beaten shore, we may feel the
power of the sea in the overhanging
cliffs even when there are no waves. In
the rivei-, the waterfall, or the glacier,
the energy which enters into the work
appeals to the informed imagination</PB>

scarcely less than do its visible results.
This enlarged conception is what makes
the difference between the ignorant and
the cultivated appreciation of the beau-
ties of nature. With the rustic,
A primrose by a rivers brim
A yellow prinirose is to him,
And it is nothing more.

	Knowledge it is which places the blos-
som in the realm of life, making us to
see it as the product of the ages, in kin-
ship with what has gone before and
what is to come hereafter, and thus en-
dows it with the dignity that thought
can lend. This is as true of the earth
as of its flowers. With most if not all
people, the landscape gains much from
its associations with mankind. Even
where human life does not enter visibly
or in conscious memory, it usually seeks
a place shyly and as an aside, in mere
spectres of the imagination which we un-
consciously allow to enter on the scene.
Even if the view be in desert wilder-
nesses, the observer, if he be attentive to
his thought, will remark the work of
this humanizing instinct. If the scene
be such as the eternal snowfields or the
troops of icebergs present, excluding
the conception of life, we feel that it in
some way fails to awaken the mind.
We do not go forth to it as its mere phy-
sical charm bids us do. On this account,
the quality of the human life of a field,
that which is visible or in memory, has
with most men quite as much to do with
its value as a landscape as its physical
aspect has.
	With the advance which an assiduous
training of the landscape sense brings,
the observer finds himself less in need
of the human note in the view; his de-
velopment follows the course by which
the landscape motive became established.
In its earlier stages, only the regions of
garden-like aspect commanded ~sthetic
approval; then only so much of primi-
tive nature as would make a foil for the
culture was admitted to be good. Even
the Alps, though they rise from fertile
plains, in no wise charmed the ancients;
until within two centuries they were ut-
terly repugnant to refined minds. Now
those of well-trained eye find sntisfaction
in the wilderness, though all alike will
confess that the scenes which yield the
most pleasure are those which are at once
humanized and historic. All this points
to the conclusion that the novice will do
well to begin his studies of the landscape
with its more domesticated parts. Even
the cities and great towns commonly
afford prospects which are sufficiently
gratifying to the ~stlietic sense to give
it nurture. The many strong impres-
sions arising from the grouping of build-
ings, which even when bad in themselves
often afford agreeable masses and sky-
lines, make them profitable to the be-
ginner by the easily acquired impressions
they present. Moreover, our cities, by
the very badness of their smoke and dust
laden air, are richer in atmospheric ef-
fects of a striking kind than is the open
country; by them the observer may be
led to note those more delicately toned
qualities of atmosphere which, though
they are the very flower of the land-
scape, are so generally overlooked.
	From the limited though varied as-
pects of the overhumanized views in and
about the town, the student should pass,
in a well-devised gradation, to the scenes
where pure nature, though the fields be
tilled, controls the expression, and thence
by a further step to the primitive lands
where there is no trace of the hand of
man. As he departs from the realm of
excessive culture, where the expression
of the earth everywhere is controlled by
the artificial, the need increases of an
enlargement of the conception by the un-
derstanding of how the natural forces
have shaped the view. In place of the
power of man which is so manifest in his
seats of most dominant action, we have
in the wilderness the elemental forces,
those which make and unmake the lands
and which rule every feature of their
aspect. To have these conceptions so</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00789" SEQ="0789" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="783">The Landscape as a iiicans of Culture.	783

well in mind that they may afford even
a general basis for interpreting the land-
scape demands a somewhat extended
training in that part of geology which
is included in modern geography,  a
science not limited, as of old, to mere
statements of facts concerning the earth
forms, but going back to their causes.
This schooling, which is happily becom-
ing common, leads the student to take
account of the variations of the earths
surface, and to seek their explanation in
visible processes of nature.
	With some knowledge of what we may
term the evolution of scenery, the ob-
server will be led almost at a glance to
create a persl)ective in time for the land-
scape he is beholding,  less vivid, of
course, than that it occupies in space, but
of the same mind-leading quality that
takes the imagination afar. It is not to
be expected that these conceptions will
have scientific value,  they may indeed
not rise above the plane occupied by the
legends of men and their doings,  but
they may well have all the truth that the
poetic needs demand, for Fancy cares
more that her servants are nimble than
that they are scientifically accurate.
	It is easy to see an historic foundation
for the value which we find in the con-
ception of the action of the forces which
shape the landscape; for the history of
mans relations to nature shows us that
all the true poetry which we have from
it comes out of the ineradicable idea that
the natural realm is informed with a
spirit like our own. To the pantheist
the world is hut the expression of the
universal (livine power. To the poly-
theist each entity of shape and action
represents the thought or will of a god
of some degree. To the monotheist all
things are the work of the supreme pow-
er dwelling apart from, yet informing
all things. These views, under the in-
fluence of which our minds have taken
their shape, have the common quality
that they have led men to see, behind
the face of events and forms, the might
that shaped them. One of the distress-
ing influences of natural science upon the
people of to-day  be it said of to-day,
for the situation is most likely but tern-
porary  is a crude view to the effect
that the universe is a great mechanical
contrivance, going like a huge clockwork
moved by a power lying quite beyond
the limits of our understanding. In the
present state of our learning, there is
no escape from this tyranny of the ma-
chine except by going so close to ac-
tual nature that we feel the currents of
its life even as we do those of our own
bodies, seeing how the forces have worked
to produce in the end our intelligence
which looks forth upon the universe and
the beauty that gratifies our sympathetic
desires.
	While any one may feel a measure
of satisfaction in the beauty of a land-
scape, the degree of the satisfaction is
doubtless in large part determined by
what we read into the scene. it is as
in hearing music, where much of the
pleasure comes, miot from the associa-
tions of sounds, but from the thought
which they excite. So, too, in a play,
though the acting be bad and the ideas
displeasing, the mind may be aroused to
make a by-play, as it would not do but
for the stimulus of the situation. Such
secondary pleasures depend for their ex-
istence on the mental store which he
who hears or sees brings with him to the
orchestra or the stage. Unless lie have
a store of fit memories out of which his
fancy can build its edifices, his profit is
not likely to be great. The stock which
the amateur of the landscape may pro-
fitably bring with him to the theatre he
attends is all that relates thereto in the
way of lore of earth and man.
	A common error on the part of those
who seek to acquire some sense of the
beauty of the landscape is that its charmn
exists only in certain very select places,
to which it is necessary to resort in or-
dei to obtain such impressions. So they
hie away from the beauty which is about</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00790" SEQ="0790" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="784">784	The Landscape as a ilifeans of Culture.
them, to seek, at much cost, that which
is usually far less comprehensible than
what they left at their doors. It may
well be said that all landscapes are beau-
tiful, and that while the harvest which
may be won from them by those who
know how to gathei it varies greatly in
kind, its value changes in no like mea-
sure. It is the part of fancy to separate
the dross from the gold. This is to be
done in the appreciation of the beauty
of a landscape, however limited that may
be, as it is in other work of the ideals.
There are few, if any, scenes deserving
the name of landscape so utterly ignoble
that they yield nothing to such assay.
They may foil the eye of the novice, but
not that of the master in the art of seeing.
	One of the evils which come from
overmuch search after rarely composed
and famous landscapes is that the mein-
ones they leave become false standards,
leading their possessors to overlook the
beauty which is about them, because it
is other than they have had chosen for
them as the proper fashion for nature to
follow. One of the best results of a crit-
ical method with this art of beholding
the face of the earth will be the clearing
away of this false view. Every student
should be on his guard against it. Let
him go as far as he will, see as much of
the earth as he can, but let him not for-
get that it is about as reasonable to go
on long journeys to make human friends
as it is to seek in that way for the
friendship of nature. The chance for
both is at its best near home.
	It is often suggested that the true way
to acquire a keen sense of natural beauty
in any field is to practice delineation
with the pencil or brush. It is clear that
the ability to discern is greatly improved
by such training, and in so far as seeing
clearly is part of the landscape art, this
training is of much value; a share of it
is indeed almost indispensable in an ef-
fective education. It appears doubtful,
however, whether the drawing habit af-
fords all that its advocates claim for it,
for the reason that, when well developed,
it tends so far to fix the attention on the
elements of form as to separate the mind
from the larger interests of the scene.
If the draughtsman attain to the digni-
ty of the true artist, so that his craft
becomes the unconscious instrument of
his understanding and feeling, lie may
use his hands to help his eyes; but this
station is won by few even among those
who gain a name in the profession. The
greater number do not attain to more
than mere delineation; they fail to pene-
trate the depths of the landscape. Their
pictures, after the manner of photo-
graphs, render the facts with more or
less accuracy, but they do not, in the man-
ner of true sympathetic art, translate
them into terms which arouse the emo-
tions. The task of depicting is in itself
so absorbing of the attention that the
novice is likely to be diverted by it from
his main end, which is to enter upon a
friendly relation with the scene. His con-
tact with it is apt to take on a business-
like character which will hinder his en-
largement. Therefore it seems best for
the beginner to use the pencil and the
brush as he may use the field-glass, to
aid his seeing and to develop the habit of
looking closely, supplementing the note-
book picture, when he makes it, by the
photograph, which for the mere record of
fact is better than any handwork can be.
	Some people are likely to resent the
suggestion that the instinctive pleasure
which they derive from the landscape
should be made the subject of a delib-
erate training, because it seems to them
that the emotions lie beyond the field of
schooling. To this objection, which at
first sight appears to have some value, it
may be answered that the pleasure which
we have from music or from the drama
is of the same primitive nature as that
which the earths prospects afford. Yet
these arts have been subjected to a pro-
cess of culture, to the vast advantage of
men. Even more purely instinctive ac-
tions, such as the movements of the limbs,</PB>

are profitably removed from the animal
plane by education, as by a training in
dancing or fencing. While a novice in
them, the youth is conscious of all he
does, but, as is well said, the second na-
ture stage of the culture again makes
him free with a perfected freedom. He
forgets the rules of the dance or the mimic
combat, but his body and mind retain the
alacrity and grace which they impart.
	We may fairly reckon that with the
landscape motive, as with other forms
of the sympathetic emotions, all sound
training will but serve to enlarge and
emancipate the instinct, giving it a
chance to attain something like the place
that music and acting have won with
like aid from the rational side of the
mind. As regards the art of appreciat-
ing the landscape, we are at present in
the state in which music and acting were
before the score and the stage had been
invented. Men whistled, sang, and mim-
icked their fellows before they brought
these actions into set form. No one will
doubt, however, that the higher steps have
been well taken, and that the musical and
dramatic motives are really finer than
they were of old.
	If, as seems likely, we can bring into
definite shape, by educative means, the
emotions which lead to pleasure in the
landscape, we shall thereby add anoth-
er important art to those which serve
to dignify our lives. The art of seeing
the landscape has a certain advantage
over all the others we have invented, in
that the data it uses are ever before
those who are blessed with eyes. Out-
side of prison, a man is sure of the sky,
 the largest, most varied, and in some
regards the richest element of all scenes.
The earth about him may be defiled, but
rarely in such measure that it will not
yield him good fruit. Every look abroad
tempts him beyond himself into an en-
larging contact with nature. Not only
are the opportunities for this art ever
soliciting the mind, but the practice of it
demands no long and painful novitiate.
There is much satisfaction at the very
beginning of the practice; it grows with
exercise, until it opens the world as no
other art can do.

DEAR SISTER JENNY,  It is a long

time since I have had on hand to send</PB>

you the little bit of remembrance marked
on the other page, but I am held in such
a ferment of perpetual hurry and bother-
ation here and have grown so weak and
weary of my sad work, (till it do end),
that I have seldom five minutes to dis-
pose of in my own way, and leave many
little jobs undone for a long time and
many little satisfactions unenjoyed for
want of a bold stroke at them. Finally
I bethought me of the Dr. in Edinburgh
and he has now got me your little paper
into readiness for sending. I understand
you have nothing to do but present it at
the Bank and at once get payment. If,
(till you have time to write a long letter
of news, which will be very welcome),
you at once address me a Canada news-
paper with thre~ strokes, nothing more
will be necessary in regard to this little
bit of business.
	I expect to get done with my book in
six or eight months. 0 that I saw the
day! I can and have been working
thitherward with all the strength that
I possess, to the hurt of my health as
well, but I calculate when the end have
once come I shall begin directly to im-
prove more or less, and perhaps by de-
grees get very considerably better again.
I had an excellent horse who had carried
me 7 years and above twenty thousand
miles, his hoofs were got spoiled on the
stone hard roads. He came plunging
down with me one day, (not throwing
me nor hurting me in the slightest),  a
most decided fall for no reason whatever
 upon which I had to sell him (to a
kind master for an old song), and for
the last six weeks have been walking,
which was a great enjoyment by way
of change. It would not do, however,
and since about a week I am mounted
again:  very swift, very rough (in
comparison to my old friend), but good
natured, healthy, willing:  and must
continue adding a dozen miles daily to
the twenty thousand already done.
	We have had such a winter for
warmth as was never seen before, not
very healthy, I believe, but it has agreed
well with Jane:  and indeed the kin-
dred, I think, are all well. Poor Wullie
Carlyle (if you remember him at all)
died lately at Edinburgh, an old man,
as we are all growing hereabouts.
	Tell Alick about my affairs and this
last news you have had. That I never
do or can forget him, he need not be
told. I hope your lasses are doing well
and that Robert and all of you are push-
ing along patiently, faithfully as hereto-
fore.

	In August, 1863, Mrs. Carlyle fell in
St. Martins Lane and broke her thigh.
The accident resulted in long illness and
pain. During the spring of 1864 she
grew worse, and in March was taken to
St. Leonards. From a subsequent trip
to Scotland she returned in October to
Cheyne Row, weak, shattered, body
worn to a shadow, spirit bright as ever.
	The last volume of Frederick was pub-
lished in April, 1865. When the proofs
were finished, Carlyle and his wife went
to Devonshire for a few weeks with Lady
Ashburton.

	DEAR JENNY,  Two or three days
ago, I saw a letter from you to Sister
Jean; which was very welcome here,
as bringing more definite news of you
than we had got for a good while be-
fore. I have now got done with my
Book (a copy of it probably in your
hands before this); and am not hence-
forth to be so dreadfully hampered in
writing a little note to my friends from
time to time. I am still in a huge fuss,
confusions of all kinds lying about me,
and indeed I am just about running off
for Scotland (to Jeans, in the first place),
to try and recover a little from the com-
pletely shattered state these twelve years
of incessant drudgery and slaving have
reduced me to. But there is something</PB>

I had meant, this long time and here it
is  just come to hand. Inclosed is a
Paper which will bring you the amount
of Dollars for 20, on your presenting
it at the Hamilton Bank. If by way
of identifying, they ask you who
sends the money, you can answer with
my name, and if further needful, add
that the Negociator for me with the
Edinr. Bank, was Dr. Carlyle of that
City. Nothing more, I suppose, if even
that much will be necessary. Let me
know by return that it is safe in your
hand (a newspaper with three strokes
will serve if you are short of time for
the moment). ~ And so with my best
blessings, dear little Jenny, accept this
poor mark of my remembrance.
	My Jane is very frail and feeble, but
always stirring about, and has got bless-
edly away out of the horrible torments
she had (and all of you had on her ac-
count) last year. Scotsbrig, Gill, Dum-
fries, Edinburgh; all is going in the
usual average way there. To you I
can fancy what a distress the removal
of your poor little Mary and her Hus-
band to the Far West must be! These
things happen and are inevitable in the
current of life. That your son-in-law is
a good man, this should be a great joy
to you. Do not you be too hasty to fol-
low to Iowa; consider it well first.
	You see what a shaky hand I have;
you do not see the bitter hurry I am
still in! With kindest wishes to you
and all your household,
	Ever your Affectionate Brother,
T.	CARLYLE.


	Carlyle was elected Lord Rector of
the University of Edinburgh in Novem-
ber, 1865; and on April 2, 1866, spoke
his inaugural address at Edinburgh, of
which the best account known to me 
best for a general impression of Carlyle
 is that given by Mr. Moncure Conway.
On the 2lst of April the news of Mrs.
Carlyles sudden death was brought to
Carlyle at his sisters house in Dumfries.
The epitaph which he wrote for her grave
in the abbey church of Haddington ends
with the words, And the light of his life
as if gone out.
	An episode of the time when that
light was fading will remain longer
with some of us than most of the occur-
rences of Carlyles life. Mrs. Oliphant
has left a sketch, done with very few
lines, of Mrs. Carlyle playing Scotch
airs  to the tall old man in his dress-
ing-gown, sitting meditative by the fire.
Carlyle himself, in his Journal for De-
cember 3, 1867, described the last of
these occasions: One evening, I think
in the spring of 1866, we two had come
up from dinner and were sitting in this
room, very weak and weary creatures,
perhaps even I the wearier, though she
far the weaker; I at least far the more
inclined to sleep, which directly after
dinner was not good for me. Lie on
the sofa there, said she  the ever kind
and graceful, herself refusing to do so
 there, but dont sleep, and I, after
some superficial objecting, did. In old
years I used to lie that way, and she
would play the piano to me: a long se-
ries of Scotch tunes which set my mind
finely wandering through the realms of
nI~mory and romance, and effectually
prevented sleep. That evening I had
lain but a few minutes when she turned
round to her piano, got out the Thom-
son Burns book, and, to my surprise and
joy, broke out again into her bright little
stream of harmony and poesy, silent for
at least ten years before, and gave me,
in soft tinkling beauty, pathos, and
melody, all my old favourites: Banks
and Braes, Flowers of the Forest,
Gilderoy, not forgetting Duncan
Gray, Cauld Kail, Irish Coolen, or
any of my favourites tragic or comic.
 . . That piano has never again sound-
ed, nor in my time will or shall. In late
months it has grown clearer to me than
ever that she had said to herself that
night, I will play his tunes all yet
once, and had thought it would be but</PB>

once. . . . This is now a thing infinite-
ly touching to me. So like her; so like
her. Alas, alas! I was very blind,
and might have known better how near
its setting my bright sun was.
	The following letter is shadowed with
the death of Mrs. Carlyle, although near-
ly two years had passed.

XXXIX.	CARLYLE TO MRS. HANNING, HAMIL-
TON, C. w.

CHELSEA, 14th February, 1868.

	M~ DEAR JENNY,  This is a little
New Years gift which I intended for
you sooner. It (the essential part of it)
has been lying here apart and wrapt up
for you ever since Christmas time, but
I never could get up to have it made
into a banking, portable form till now,
so languid, sad and lazy have I been!
The banks all close at an earlier hour
than my walking one, and it is rare that
I can get so far into town in time. I am
dreadfully indisposed to writing, and
even my poor shaking right hand makes
continual protest! I hope the poor lit-
tle Gift will be welcome to you and in
some savings bank or otherwise be inno-
cently waiting to do you good some time
or other!  I am told there will be no
difficulty for you at the Gore Bank
in Hamilton merely to go thither and
sign your name. A newspaper with
three strokes will sufficiently announce
it for me till you have leisure for writ-
ing. I have also sent a photograph for
nephew Toms young wife, to whom,
with all my affectionate regards to them
both, pray send it by your first oppor-
tunity. There is another (if the letter
will carry it), for yourself for your own
free disposal otherwise.
	I am not specially in worse health
than usual, but excessively languid, dis-
pirited, weary, sad and idle  especial-
ly in the late dark months of winter,
which however are now gone, and in-
deed were never severe, but lighter upon
us than common. Jean has been here
ever since early in December. It makes
the house a little less lonesome to me
than it has become for the last twenty
two months, but cannot, as you may
imagine, lift the heavy heart of me into
anything of cheeriness, nor indeed per-
haps should it. She will go home by
Liverpool before long, where her son
Jim (who is a clever solid fellow and
has got promotion in Liverpool) is just
setting up house with his sister Maggie
as Manageress. Their mother will look
in so soon as they have the home settled.
All kinds of business are reported as ut-
terly dull here: much distress among the
idle poor  and a general silent anxiety
as to this new Reform Bill or Leap
in the dark,  poor stupid souls!
	An extremely accursed atrocity of mur-
der and worse has happened in Cum-
mertrees, which has thrown all the com-
munity into horror and excitation  of
which you will see or hear soon enough
in the newspapers and probably know the
location as I do.
	Your kindred in Annandale and here
are all well and I can send their best
regards.
	Ever your affectionate brother,
T.	CARIJYLE.


	In October, 1868, Carlyle was again
thrown,  this time from a horse named
Comet. A conversation with the Queen,
the death of Mr. Erskine of Linlathen,
and a letter to the Times newspaper
on the Franco-Prussian war were among
the events of the next few years.
	Carlyle speaks again now of his shak-
ing right hand. A few weeks after he
quite lost the use of it for writing with
a pen. Mary Aitken, ready to write
to his dictation, was Mary Carlyle Ait-
ken, daughter to his sister Jean.

XL. CARLYLE TO MRS. HANNING, HAMIL-
TON, c. w.

5 CHEYNE Row, CHELSEA, 13 Feb. 1871.

M~ DEAR SISTER JENNY,  Here is a

little bit of a present which you must ac-
cept from me; it was intended for the</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00795" SEQ="0795" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="789">	Unpublished Letters of Carl yle.	789

New Years time, but has been belated;
which will do it no great ill with you.
Buy yourself something nice with it;
and consider at all times that my affec-
tionate best wishes are with you; and
that if I could in any way do you a use-
ful kindness, I gladly would.
	We get a good few Canada news-
papers from you; welcome tokens of
your remembrance: in one of the last,
there was a very melancholy item of
news marked by your hand,  the death
of your dear little grandchild, poor
Marys Bairn; we conceived painfully
how sad it must have made you all; and
were ourselves sad and sorry. Poor
Mary, she was herself a child when I
saw her last, and she is now a bereaved
mother:  Death snatches us from one
another at all ages! I often think with
silent gratitude to Providence how gen-
tly we older ones have been dealt with in
this respect; saved, a whole family of
us, for so many years; none lost but
poor Margaret, (very dear, and very sa-
cred to me at this hour), and a wee wee
Jenny whom you never saw, but whose
death, and my mothers unappeasable
grief for it, are still strangely present to
me, after near seventy years. All we
can say is, both the Living and the Dead
are with God; and we have to obey,
and be of hope.
	You regret sometimes that I do not
write to you; but it is not my blame,
it is my misfortune rather. For rather
above five years past my right hand has
been getting useless for writing, (the left
strangely enough, is still steady, and
holds good) ; the weight of years, too,
75 of them gone December last, presses
heavy on me; and all work, but most
especially all kinds of writing, are a
thing I avoid as sorrowfully disagree-
able. Mary Aitken, who drives an ad-
mirable pen, is indeed ever willing to be
dictated to; and I do, in cases of ne-
cessity, trust that method; but find, on
the whole, that it never will succeed with
me.
	From the Dr. and from Jean I believe
you get all the news that are worth writ-
ing; and that is the main interest in the
matter.
	The Dr. is in Edinburgh of late
weeks, and seems to be enjoying himself
among old friends :  and finds it, no
doubt, a pleasant and useful interruption
of his Dumfries solitude, to which he
will return with fresh appetite. He is
much stronger and cheerier than I; five
years younger, and at least twice five
lighter of heart. He has an excellent
lodging at Dumfries yonder; and is of
much service to all the kindred; every
one of whom he is continually ready
to help. Mary Aitken has been here
with me above two years :  a bright
little soul, writing for me, trying to be
useful and cheerful to me. I have plenty
of friends here; but none of them do me
much good, except by their evident good-
will; company in general is at once
wearisome and hurtful to me; silence,
and the company of my own sombre
thoughts, sad probably, but also loving
and beautiful, are wholesomer than talk-
ing; these and a little serious reading
are my chief resource. I have no bodily
ailment, except what belongs to the grad-
ual decay of a digestive faculty which
was always weak; except when sleep-
less nights afflict me too much, I have
no reason to complain, but the contrary.
This winter, now nearly done, has been
a blusterous, cold, inclement one as any
I can latterly remember; it grew at last
to tell upon me as the unfriendliest of
all its brethren :  but I think, after all,
it may have done me little or no int~insic
damage. With the new Spring and its
bright days I hope to awaken again and
shake away this torpor of nerves and
mind. I have long owed Alick a letter
 that is to say, intended to write him
one, though by count it is his turn. I
often think of you all on that side the
Sea as well as this; if that could do you
any good, alas! I will end here, dear
little Sister; wishing all that is good to</PB>

you and yours, as at all times. I am and
remain,

T.	CARLYLE.
	Send a newspaper with 3 strokes
when this comes: dont trouble yrself
with any other announcement.

	In November, 1872, Emerson made
his last visit to England. Carlyle was
iiow reduced to writing in largish let-
ters with blue pencil. After the next
letter he never wrote again with his own
hand to Mrs. Hanning or to any mem-
ber of the family across the Atlantic.

XLI. CARLYLE TO MRS. HANNING, HAMIL-
TON, C. w.

CHELSEA, 2 Jane 1873.

	DEAR SISTER JENNY,  I please my-
self with the thought that you will ac-
cept this little Newyears Gift from me
as a sign of my unalterable affection,
whh tho it is obliged to be silent (un-
able to write as of old) cannot fade away
until I myself do! Of that be always
sure, my dear little sister,  and that
if in anything I can be of help to you
or yours, I right willingly will.
	Cliuthills Photograph is wonder-
ful and deeply affecting to me. Not one
feature in it can I recognise as his : such
are the changes half-a-century works
upon us! If you have any means, send
him my affectionate remembrances and
unchanged good-wishes.
	No more from this lame hand, dear
Sister Jenny,  except my hearts bless-
ings for the year and forever.
Y~ affects Brother,
T.	CARLYLE.


	Carlyles eightieth birthday  Decem-
ber 4, 1875 (year of Early Kings of
Norway and Portraits of John Knox)
 was celebrated with a memorial from
his friends and a whirlwind of gifts
and congratulations. In February,
1876, John Forster died, and in April
Carlyles brother Alexander. Carlyle
wrote in his Journal: Young Alicks
account of his death is altogether in-
teresting  a scene of sublime simpli-
city, great and solemn under the hum-
blest forms. That question of his, when
his eyes were already shut, and his mind
wavering before the last finis of all : 
Is Tom coIning from Edinburgh the
morn? will never leave me should I
live a hundred years. Poor Alick, my
ever faithful brother! Come back across
wide oceans and long decades of time to
the scenes of brotherly companionship
with me, and going out of the world as
it were with his hand in mine. Many
times he convoyed me to meet the Dum-
fries coach, or to bring me home from
it, and full of bright and perfect affec-
tion always were those meetings and
partings.

	The last bit of Carlyles writing
printed during his life was a letter
to the Times, in May, 1877, on the
Russo-Turkish war. In the same year
Boehm made a statue of Carlyle, and
Millais a portrait.
	John Carlyle died in 1879. Carlyle
was now growing steadily weaker, and
by October of 1880 was under the con-
stant care of a physician.
	Mary Aitken, by marriage with her
cousin Alexander Carlyle, was now be-
come Mary Carlyle.

XLII. MRS. ALEXANDER CARLYLE TO MRS.

24 CHEYNE Row, CHELSEA,

18 July, 1880.
	M~ DEAR AUNT,  I received my
Cousin Mrs. Bairds letter about ten
days ago, asking for tidings of my Uncle.
I am extremely sorry that you have been
made anxious about him through my not
writing; but indeed there have been
many sufficient apologies for my waut
of punctuality in that way, which, how-
ever, I need not trouble you with here.
It will suffice to say that I use the very
first chance I have had to answer your
enquiries.</PB>

	It is not very easy to explain to you
exactly how Uncle is. He is exceedingly
weak, hardly able to walk fifty yards
without help, and yet until about ten
days ago, when he had a very severe at-
tack of Diarrhaia which has left him
much below par, he was what one might
call for him very well. He generally
spends his mornings till about half past
two oclock between lying on the sofa,
reading in his easy chair, and smoking
an occasional pipe; at half past two he
goes out to drive for two or two and a
half hours, sleeps on the sofa till dinner
time (half past six) then after dinner
sleeps again, at nine has tea, reads or
smokes or talks, or lies on the sofa till
bed time, which is usually about mid-
night, and so ends the day. He looks
very well in the face, has a fine, fresh
ruddy complexion and an immense quan-
tity of white hair, his voice is clear and
strong, he sees and hears quite well;
but for the rest, as I have said, lie is not
good at moving about. In general he
is wonderfully good humored and con-
tented; and on the whole carries his
eighty-four years well. He desires me
to send you his kind love, and his good
wishes: as you know, he writes to no-
body at all. I do not think he has writ-
ten a single letter, even dictated one,
for over a year.
	We are very glad to hear that all is
well with you and with all your family.
I have not time for more just now, as I
am interrupted. Good-bye, dear aunt.
I am, Your affectionate Niece,
MARY CARLYLE.


	Carlyle died on the 5th of February,
1881. The Abbey was offered, but re-
fused; and, as the world knows, Carlyle
was buried in the kirkyard of his native
Ecclefechan. The following narrative
of the funeral is from the pen of Mr.
John Carlyle Aitken, brother to Mary
Aitken Carlyle. One likes his letters
less than his sisters, which are perfect
iii their unaffected plainness.
XLIII. MR. JOHN CARLYLE AITREN TO MRS.
HANNING, HAMILTON, C. W.
Tm~ HILL, DIJMFRIES, N. B.,

11 Feb., 1881.

	M~ DEAR AUNT,  Today I mean
only to write a note of the more needful
details, reserving for a more fitting time
the full statement. I need not worry
you with the account of my tempestu-
ous voyage from New York, in which I
made acquaintance with a hurricane, and
its full meaning  nor how glad I was at
sight of the dear bare and rugged hills
of my native land  Leaving America
to the Americans  and welcome! I
shall think for sometime ere I do the
herring-pond again! Well, no more
of that if you love me! no more o that!
I am home, and well, and likely to re-
main there for the remainder of my days
in one shape or other. Let that serve
just now on that score.
	You would observe the date of Uncles
death and might hear of it the same
day, as I thought. At all events The
Scotsman would supply more details;
and that I hope reached you all right.
All has been in such hurry, bustle and
confusion ever since that no one has had
time to think of writing anything requir-
ing time or calm consideration. Uncle
had not been considered seriously ill
more thaii about a fortnight or so before
the end. The vital spark of life towards
the last days kept flickering in a way so
extraordinary that the Doctor declared
he had never met such tenacity of life
and vitality in the whole course of his
varied London and other experience.
Dear Uncle, the good, true and noble
old man fhat he was, really suffered lit-
tle in the way of pain for some weeks
before his death, which was itself little
more than a gentle flickering sleep, end-
ing in a scarcely heard last sigh of
sound. While lying in a comatose or
unconscious state his mind seemed to
wander back to old Annandale memo-
ries of his ever loved ones and their sur-
roundings; his mother holding her su</PB>

preme seat surrounded by a trooping
throng of once familiar faces, not very
greatly less dear to him. He died full of
years, with all his weary task of worlds
work well and nobly done, and leaves
no mortal behind him who does not love
and reverence his life and memory.
	By the newspapers I send today you
may see how very quiet the funeral
yesterday was. The vale of Annan was
grim and wintry. You could catch a
glimpse of Hoddam, the Brownmuir,
Woodcockaire, and all the old places
through the white roupy mist hanging
over and round them. The most touch-
ing sight I saw was that of three gray
haired, smooth crowned fathers of the
village of Ecclefechan, who stood togeth-
er by the way-side, bare-headed and with
unfeigned sadness of face and manner
silently and impressively bearing witness
to their sorrow. It was really very touch-
ing to look upon. The Presbyterian Kirk
bells tolled mournfully as they laid him
gently in the bed of rest within a few
yards of the place where he first drew
the breath of life, and all was as unosten-
tatious as he himself desired it might
be. Ah, me! Ah, me! Uncle James
was there, as the last male link of the
ever shortening chain. Mother bids me
send her love to you and your fellow
mourners who here and over all the wide
world are many. All would gladly unite
in sympathy and love with you in your
far away home.
Ever affectionately,
JOHN C. AITKEN.


I give here the conclusion of Mr.
Reginald Blunts account of the move-
ment to preserve Carlyles house: 
The canvass was pushed vigorously
forward from the beginning of 1895.
Circulars and letters were widely distrib-
uted, the assistance of libraries through-
out the country was invoked, and, by the
invitation of the Lord Mayor, a crowded
meeting was held at the Mansion House
at the end of February, and addressed
by Lord Ripon, the United States Am-
bassador, Mr. Leonard Courtney, Mr.
Leslie Stephen, and Mr. Crockett. Funds
came in slowly, but steadily; auxiliary
committees were formed in New York
and in Glasgow, and over 400 was re-
mitted from America. By the end of
April about 2000 had been collected,
sufficient to complete the purchase, pay
the expenses of the fund, and carry out
part of the essential repairs. The free-
hold of the house was accordingly bought
in May, and, after a careful survey of
its actual condition, the necessary works
were put in hand at the end of the month,
and completed in June. The end of the
season in London, and the occurrence of
a General Election in July, rendered the
arrangement of any opening ceremony
impossible, and the House was therefore
opened informally at the end of July, and
was visited by over a thousand persons,
from all parts of the world, during the
next six weeks.

	In December, 1897, at the age of
eighty-four, died Janet Carlyle Hanning,
the last surviving Carlyle of her gener-
ation. As the reader has seen, many of
the foregoing letters were addressed to
her. Those which had passed between
other members of the family, and were
afterward either carried by her beyond
seas or sent to her in Canada, were kept
by Mrs. Hanning as precious memorials
of family affection.

CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIANS.

	THE Californian loves his state be-
cause his state loves him, and he re-
turns her love with a fierce affection
that men of other regions are slow to
understand. Hence he is impatient of
outside criticism. Those who do not
love California cannot understand her,
and, to his mind, their shafts, however
aimed, fly wide of the mark. Thus, to
say that California is commercially
asleep, that her industries are gambling
ventures, that her local politics is in the
hands of professional pickpockets, that
her small towns are the shabbiest in
Christendom, that her saloons control
more constituents than her churches,
that she is the slave of corporations,
that she knows no such thing as public
opinion, that she has not yet learned to
distinguish enterprise from highway
robbery nor reform from blackmail, 
all these things and many more the
Californian may admit in discussion or
may say himself, but he does not find
them acceptable from others. They
may be more or less true, in certain
times and places, but the conditions
which have permitted them will like-
wise mend them. It is said in the Alps
that not all the vulgar people who
come to Chamonix can ever make
Chamonix vulgar. For similar rea-
sons, not all the sordid people who drift
overland can ever vulgarize California.
Her fascination endures, whatever the
accidents of population.
	The charm of California has, in the
main, three sources,  scenery, climate,
and freedom of life.
	To know the glory of California
scenery, one must live close to it
through the changing years. From Sis-
kiyou to San Diego, from Mendocino
to Nariposa, from Tahoe to the Far-
ralones, lake, crag, or chasm, forest,
mountain, valley, or island, river, bay,

the stamp of its own peculiar beauty, a

and freedom of life.
	To know the glory of California

through the changing years. From Sis-

ralones, lake, crag, or chasm, forest,

the warm California sun. Here, if any-
where, life is worth living, full and rich
and free.
	As there is from end to end of Cali-
fornia scarcely one commonplace mile,
so from one end of the year to the other
there is hardly a tedious day. Two sea-
sons only has California, but two are
enough if each iu its way be perfect.
Some have called the climate monoto-
nous, but so, no doubt, is good health.
In terms of Eastern experience, tbe sea-
sons may be defined as late in the
spring and early in the fall;
Half a year of clouds and flowers, half a
year of dust and sky,
according to Bret Harte. But with the
dust and sky comes the unbroken succes-
sion of days of sunshine, the dry invigor-
ating air, and the boundless overflow of
vine and orchard. Each season in its
turn brings its fill of satisfaction, and
winter or summer we regret to look for-
ward to change, because we would not
give up what we have for the remem-
bered delights of the season that is past.
If one must choose, in all the fragrant
California year the best month is June;
for then the air is softest, and a touch
of summers gold overlies the green of
winter. But October, when the first
swift rains

dash the whole long slope with color,

and leave the clean-washed atmosphere
so absolutely transparent that even dis-
tance is no longer blue, has a charm
not less alluring.
	So far as man is concerned, the one
essential fact is that he is never the
climates slave; he is never beleaguered
by the powers of the air. Winter
and summer alike call him out of doors.
In summer he is not languid, for the air
is iever sultry. In most regions he is
seldom hot, for in the shade or after
nightfall the dry air is always cool.
When it rains, the air may be chilly, in-
doors or out, but it is never cold enough
to make the remorseless base-burner a
welcome alternative. The habit of roast-
ing ones self all winter long is unknown
iu California. The old Californian sel-
dom built a fire for warmths sake.
When he was cold in the house lie went
out of doors to get warm. The house
was a place for storing food and keeping
ones belongings from the wet. To hide
in it from the weather would be to lay a
false stress on its function.
	The climate of California is especial-
ly kind to childhood and old age. Men
live longer there, and, if unwasted by
dissipation, strength of body is better
conserved. To children the conditions
of life are particularly favorable. Cali-
fornia could have no better advertise-
ment at some worlds fair than the visi-
ble demonstration of this fact. A series
of measurements of the children of Oak-
land has recently been taken, in the in-
terest of comparative child-study; and
should the average of these for differ-
ent ages be worked into a series of
moulds or statues for comparison with
similar models from Eastern cities, the
result would cause surprise. The chil-
dren in California, other things being
equal, are larger, stronger, and better
formed than their Eastern cousins of the
same age. This advantaige of develop-
ment lasts, unless cigarettes, late hours,
or grosser forms of dissipation come in
to destroy it. A wholesome, sober, out-
of-door life in California invariably
means a vigorous maturity.
	A third element of charm in Califor-
nia is that of personal freedom. The
dominant note in the social develop-
ment of the state is individualism, with
all that this implies of good or evil.
Man is man, in California: lie exists for
his own sake, not as part of a social or-
ganism. He is, in a sense, superior to
society. In the first place, it is not his
society; he came froni some other region
on his own business. Most likely, he
did not intend to stay; but, having sum-
mered and wintered in California, he
has become a Californian, and now lie</PB>

is not contented anywhere else. Life
on the coast has, for him, something of
the joyous irresponsibility of a picnic.
The feeling of children released from
school remains with grown people.
	A Western man, says Dr. Amos
G. Warner, is an Eastern man who
has had some additional experiences.
The Californian is a man from some-
where or anywhere in America or Eu-
rope, typically from New England, per-
haps, who has learned a thing or two he
did not know in the East, and perhaps
has forgotten some things it would have
been as well to remember. Time things
he has learned relate chiefly to elbow-
room, nature at first hand, and the
unearned increment. The tIming he is
most likely to forget is that escape from
public opinion is not escape from the
consequences of wrong action.
	Of elbow - room California offers
abundance. In an old civilization men
grow like trees in a close-set forest.
Individual growth and symmetry give
way to the necessity of crowding. There
is no room for spreading branches, and
the characteristic qualities and fruitage
develop only at the top. On the fron-
tier men grow as the California live
oak, which, in the open field, sends its
branches far and wide.
	With plenty of elbow-room, the Cali-
fornian works out his own inborn char-
acter. If he is gree(ly, malicious, intem-
perate, by nature, his bad qualities rise
to the second degree in California, and
sometimes to the third. The whole
responsibility rests on himself. Society
has no part of it, and he does not pre-
tend to be what he is not, out of defer-
ence to society.  Hypocrisy is the
homage vice pays to virtue, but in
California no such homage is demanded
or accepted. In like manner, the vir-
tues become intensified in freedom. No-
where in the world can one find men
and women more hospitable, more re-
fined, more charming, than in the homes
of prosperous California~ And these
homes, whether in the pine forests of
the Sierras, in the orange groves of
the south, in the peach orchards of
the Coast Range, or on the great stock
ranches, are the delight of all visitors
who enter their open doors. To be sure,
the bewildering hospitality of the great
financiers and greater gamblers of the
sixties and seventies is a thing of the
past. We shall never again see such
prodigal entertainment as that which
Ralston, bankrupt, cynical, but magnifi-
cent, once dispensed in Belmont Caiion.
Nor do we find, nowadays, such lavish
outgiving of fruit and wine, or such rush-
ing of tallyhos, as once preceded the
auction sale of town lots in paper cities.
These gorgeous spreads  were not hos-
pitality, and disappeared when the tra-
veler had learned his lesson. Their
evident purpose was the sale of worth-
less land to old duffers from the East.
But real hospitality is characteristic of
all parts of California where men and
women have an income beyond the needs
of the day.
	To a very unusual degree, the Cali-
fornian forms his own opinions on mat-
ters of politics, religion, and human life,
and these views he expresses without
reserve. His own head he carries un-
der his own hat, and whether this be
silk or a sombrero is a matter of his
own choosing. The dictates of church
and party have no binding force on him.
The Californian does not confine his
views to abstractions. He has his own
opinions of individual men and women.
If need be, he will analyze the charac-
ter, motives, and actions of his neigh-
bor in a way which will horrify the
traveler who has grown up in the shade
of a libel law.
	The typical Californian has largely
outgrown provincialism. He has seen
much of the world, and he knows the
varied worth of varied lands. He tra-
vels more widely than the man of any
other state, and he has the educatioa
which travel gives. As a rule, the well-</PB>

to-do Californian knows Europe better
than the average Eastern man of equal
financial resources, and the chances are
that his range of experience includes a
part of Asia as well. A knowledge of
his own country is a matter of course.
He has no sympathy with the essen-
tial provinciality of the mind which
knows the Eastern seaboard, and has
some measure of acquaintance with
countries and cities, and with men from
Ireland to Italy, but which is densely
ignorant of our own vast domain, and
thinks that all that lies beyond Phila-
delphia belongs to the West. Not that
provincialism is unknown in California,
or that its occasional exhibition is any
less absurd or offensive here than else-
where. For example, one may note a
tendency to set up local standards for
literary work done in California. An-
other, more harmful idea would insist
that methods outworn in the schools
elsewhere are good because they are
Californian. This is the usual provin-
cialism of ignorance, and it is found the
world over. Especially is it character-
istic of centres of population. When
men come into contact with men in-
stead of with the forces of nature, they
mistake their own conventionalities for
the facts of existence. It is not what
life is, but what the singular mess we
agree to call life  is, that interests
them. In this fashion they lose their
real understanding of affairs, become
the toys of their local environment, and
are marked as provincials or tenderfeet
when they stray away from home.
	California is emphatically one of
earths male lands, to accept Brown-
ings classification. The first Saxon
settlers were men, and in their rude
civilization women had no part. For
years women in California were objects
of curiosity or of chivalry, disturbing
rather than cementing influences in so-
ciety. Even yet California is essen-
tially a mans state. It is common to
say that public opinion does not exist
there; but such a statement is not whol-
ly correct. It does exist, but it is an
out - of - door public opinion,  a mans
view of men. There is, for example, a
strong public opinion against hypocrisy,
in California, as more than one clerical
renegade has found, to his discomfiture.
The pretense to virtue is the one vice
that is not forgiven. If a man be not
a liar, few questions are asked, least of
all the delicate one as to the name he
went by in the states. What we com-
monly call public opinion  the cut-and-
dried decision on social and civic ques-
tions  is made up in the house. It
is essentially feminine in its origin, the
opinion of householders as to how men
should behave. In California there is
little which corresponds to the social
atmosphere pervading the snug, white-
painted, green - blinded New England
villages, and this little exists chiefly in
communities of people transported thi-
ther in block,  traditions, convention-
alities, prejudices, and all. There is, in
general, no merit attached to conform-
ity, and one may take a wide range of
rope without necessarily arousing dis-
trust. Speaking broadly, in California
the virtues of life spring from within,
and are not prescribed from without.
The young man who is decent only
because he thinks that some one is look-
ing would do well to stay away. The
stern law of individual responsibility
turns the fool over to the fool-killer
without a preliminary trial. No finer
type of man can be found in the world
than the sober Californian; and yet no
coast is strewn with wrecks more pitiful.
	There are some advantages in the ab-
sence of a compelling force of public
opinion. One of them is found in the
strong self-reliance of men and women
who have made and enforced their
own moral standards. With very many
men life in California brings a decided
strengthening of the moral fibre. They
must reconsider, justify, and fight for
their standards of action; and by so</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00803" SEQ="0803" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="797">	Ual~fornia and the Cal ~fornians.	791

doing they become masters of them-
selves. With men of weak nature the
result is not so encouraging. The bad
side of this life is shown in lax business
methods, official carelessness and corrup-
tion, the widespread corrosions of vul-
gar vices, and the general lack of pride
in their work shown by artisans and
craftsmen.
	In short, California is a mans land,
with male standards of action,  a land
where one must give and take, stand
and fall, as a man. With the growth
of womans realm of homes and houses
this will slowly change. It is changing
now, year by year, for good and ill;
and soon California will have a public
opinion. Her sons will learn to fear
the rod behind the looking-glass, and
to shun evil not only because it is vile,
but because it is improper.
	Contact with the facts of nature has
taught the Californian something in it-
self. To have elbow-room is to touch
nature at more angles; and whenever she
is touched, she is an insistent teacher.
Whatever is to be done, the typical Cali-
fornian knows how to do it, and how to
do it well. He is equal to every occa-
sion. He can cinch his own saddle, har-
ness his own team, bud his own grape-
vines, cook his own breakfast, paint his
own house; and because he cannot go to
the market for every little service, per-
force he serves himself. In dealing with
college students in California, one is im-
pressed by their boundless ingenuity. If
anything needs doing, some student can
do it for you. Is it to sketch a water-
fall, to engrave a portrait, to write a
sonnet, to mend a saddle, to sing a song,
to build an engine, or to bust a bronco,
there is some one at hand who can do it,
and do it artistically. Varied ingenu-
ity California demands of her pioneers.
Their native originality has been inten-
sified by circumstances, until it has be-
come a matter of tradition and habit.
The processes of natural selection have
favored the survival of the ingenious,
and the quality of adequacy is become
hereditary.
	The possibility of the unearned incre-
ment is a great factor in the social evolu-
tion of California. Its influence has been
widespread, persistent, and in most re-
gards baneful. The Anglo-Saxon first
came to California for gold to be had
for the picking up. The hope of secur-
ing something for nothing, money or
health without earning it, has been the
motive for a large share of the subse-
quent immigration. From those who
have grown rich through undeserved
prosperity, and from those who have
grown poor in the quest of it, California
has suffered sorely. Even now, far and
wide, people think of California as a
region where wealth is not dependent
on thrift, where one can somehow strike
it rich without that tedious attention
to details and expenses which wears out
life in effete regions such as Europe and
the Eastern States. In this feeling there
is just enough of truth to keep the no-
tion alive, but never enough to save from
disaster those who make it a working
hypothesis. The hope of great or sud-
den wealth has been the mainspring of
enterprise in California, but it has also
been the excuse for shiftlessness and
recklessness, the cause of social disinte-
gration and moral decay. The Argo-
nauts of 49 were a strong, self-reliant,
generous body of men. They came for
gold, and gold in abundance. Most of
them found it, and some of them retained
it. Following them came a miscellane-
ous array of parasites and plunderers;
gamblers, dive-keepers and saloon-keep-
ers, who fed fat on the spoils of the Ar-
gonauts. Every Roaring Camp had its
Jack Hamlin as well as its Flynn of Vir-
ginia, and the wild, strong, generous,
reckless aggregate cared little for thrift,
and wasted more than they earned.
	But it is not gold alone that in Califor-
nia has dazzled men with visions of sud-
den wealth. Orange groves, peach or-
chards, prune orchards, wheat-raising,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00804" SEQ="0804" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="798">	798	Ual~fornia and the Gal ~forni ans.
lumbering, horse-farms, chicken-ranches,
bee-ranches, seal - poaching~, codfishing,
salmon-canning,  each of these has held
out the same glittering possibility. Even
the humblest ventures have caught the
prevailing tone of speculation. Industry
and trade have been followed, not for a
living, but for sudden wealth, and often
on a scale of personal expenses out of
all proportion to the probable results.
In the sixties, when the gold fever began
to subside, it was found that the despised
cow counties would bear marvelous
crops of wheat. At once wheat-raising
was undertaken on a grand scale. Farms
of five thousand to fifty thousand acres
were established on the old Spanish
grants in the valleys of the Coast Range
and in the interior.
	The comparative exhaustion of the
placer mines and the advent of quartz-
crushing with elaborate machinery have
changed gold-mining from speculation
to regular business, to the great advan-
tage of the state. In the same manner
the development of irrigation is chan-
ging the character of farming in many
parts of California. In the early days
fruit-raising was of the nature of specu-
lation, but the spread of irrigation has
brought it into more wholesome rela-
tions. To irrigate a tract of land is to
make its product certain; but at the same
time, irrigation demands expenditure of
money, and the building of a home neces-
sarily follows. Irrigation thus tends to
break up the vast farms into small hold-
ings which become permanent homes.
	On land well chosen, carefully planted,
and thriftily managed, an orchard of
prunes or of oranges should reward its
possessor with a comfortable living, be-
sides occasionally an unexpected profit
thrown in. But too often men have not
been content with the usual return, and
have planted trees with a view only to
the unearned profits. rro make an hon-
est living from the sale of oranges or
prunes is quite another thing from ac-
quiring sudden wealth. When a man
without experience in fruit-raising or in
general economy comes to California,
buys land on borrowed capital, plants it
without discrimination, and spends his
profits in advance, there can be but one
result. The laws of economics are in-
exorable even in California. One of
the curses of the state is the fool fruit-
grower, with neither knowledge nor
conscience in the management of his
business. Thousands of trees have been
planted on ground unsuitable for the pur-
pose, and thousands of trees which ought
to have done well have died through his
neglect. Through his agency frozen or-
anges are sent to Eastern markets under
his neighbors brands, and most needless-
ly his varied follies have spoiled the re-
putation of the best of fruit.
	The great body of immigrants to Cali-
fornia have been sound and earnest, fit
citizens of the young state, but this is
rarely true of seekers of the unearned
increment. No one is more greedy for
money than the man who can never get
any. Rumors of golden chances have
brought in a steady stream of incompe-
tents from all places and all strata of
social life. From the common tramp to
the inventor of  perpetual motions is
a long step in the moral scale, but both
are alike in their eagerness to escape
from the competitive social order of
the East, in which their abilities found
no recognition. Whoever has deservedly
failed in the older states is sure to think
of redeeming his fortunes in California.
Once on the Pacific slope the difficulties
in the way of his return seem insurmount-
able. The dread of the winters cold
alone is in most cases a deterrent fac-
tor. Thus San Francisco, by force of
circumstances, has become the hopper
into which fall incompetents from all the
world, and from which few escape. The
city contains about three hundred thou-
sand people. Of these, a vast number,
thirty thousand to fifty thousand, it may
be, have no real business in San Fran-
cisco. They live from hand to mouth,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00805" SEQ="0805" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="799">	Ual~fornia and the Ual~fornians.	799

by odd jobs that might be better done
by better people; and whatever their
success in making a living, they swell
the army of discontent, and confound all
attempts to solve industrial problems.
In this rough estimate I do not count
San Franciscos own poor, of which
there is a moderate proportion, but only
those who have drifted in from the out-
side. I would include, however, not
only those who are economically im-
potent, but also those who follow the
weak for predatory ends. In this last
category I place a certain number of
saloon-keepers; a class of so-called law-
yers; a long line of soothsayers, clair-
voyants, lottery agents, and joint-keepers,
beside gamblers, sweaters, promoters of
medical institutes, magnetic, psychi-
cal, and magic healers, and other types
of unhanged scoundrels that feed upon
the life-blood of the weak and foolish.
The other cities of California have had a
similar experience. Each has its repu-
tation for hospitality, and each has a con-
siderable population which has come in
from other regions because incapable of
making its own way. It is not the poor
and helpless alone who are the victims of
imposition. There are fools in all walks
in life. Many a well-dressed man or
woman can be found in the rooms of the
clairvoyant or the Chinese doctor. In
matters of health, especially, men grasp
at the most unpromising straws. In one
city I lately visited, I found scarcely a
business block that did not contain at
least one human leech under the trade
name of healer, metaphysical, electri-
cal, astral, divine, or what not. And
these will thrive so long as men seek
health or fortune with closed eyes and
open hands.
	In no way has the unearned incre-
ment been more mischievous than in the
booming of cities. With the growth of
towns comes increase in the value of the
holdings of those who hold and wait. If
the city grows rapidly enough, these gains
may be inordinately great. The mar-
velous beauty of Southern California and
the charm of its climate have impressed
thousands of people. Two or three times
this impression has been epidemic. At
one time almost every bluff along the
coast, from Los Angeles to San Diego
and beyond, was staked out in town lots.
The wonderful climate was everywhere,
and everywhere men had it for sale, not
only along the coast, but throughout the
orange-bearing region of the interior.
Every resident bought lots, all the lots
he could hold. The tourist took his
hand in speculation. Corner lots in Sari
.Diego, Del Mar, Azusa, Redlands, River-
side, Pasadena, anywhere, brought fab-
ulous prices. A village was laid out in
the uninhabited bed of a mountain tor-
rent, and men stood in the streets in
Los Angeles, ranged in line, all night
long, to await their turn in buying lots.
Worthless land and inaccessible, barren
cliffs, river-wash, sand hills, cactus de-
serts, sinks of alkali, everything met with
ready sale. The belief that Southern
California would he one great city was
universal. The desire to buy became a
mania. Millionaires of a day, even
the shrewdest lost their heads, and the
boom ended, as such booms always end,
in utter collapse.
	Mr. T. S. Van Dyke, of San Diego,
has written of this collapse: The
money-market tightened almost on the
instant. From every quarter of the
land the drain of money outward had
been enormous, and had been balanced
only by the immense amount constantly
coming in. Almost from the day this
inflow ceased money seemed scarce
everywhere, for the outgo still contin-
ued. Not only were vast sums going
out every day for water-pipe, railroad
iron, cement, lumber, and other materi-
al for the great improvements going on
in every direction, most of which mate-
rial had already been ordered, but thou-
sands more were still going out for dia-
monds and a host of other things already
bought,  things that only increase the</PB>

general indebtedness of a community by
making those who cannot afford them
imitate those who can. And tens of
thousands more were going out for but-
ter, eggs, pork, and even potatoes and
other vegetables, which the luxurious
boomers thought it beneath the dignity
of millionaires to raise.
	But the normal growth of Los Ange-
les and her sister towns has gone on, in
spite of these spasms of fever and their
consequent chills. Their real advantages
could not be obscured by the bursting
of financial bubbles. By reason of sit-
uation and climate they have continued.
to attract men of wealth and enterprise,
as well as those in search of homes and
health.
	The search for the unearned incre-
ment in bodily health brings many to
California who might better have re-
mained at home. The invalid finds
health in California only if he is strong
enough to grasp it. To one who can
spend his life out of doors it is indeed
true that our pines are trees of heal-
ing, but to one confined to the house,
there is little gain in the new conditions.
To those accustomed to the close heat
of Eastern rooms the California house
in the winter seems depressingly chilly.
	I know of few things more pitiful
than the annual migration of hop~less
consumptives to Los Angeles, Pasadena,
and San Diego. The Pullman cars in
the winter are full of sick people, ban-
ished from the East by physicians who
do not know what else to do with their
incurable patients. They go to the large
hotels of Los Angeles or Pasadena, and
pay a rate they cannot afford. They
shiver in half-warmed rooms; take cold
after cold; their symptoms grow alarm-
ing; their money wastes away; and
finally, in utter despair, they are hurried
back homeward, perhaps to die on board
the train. Or it may be that they
choose cheap lodging-houses, at prices
more nearly within their reach. Here
again, they suffer for want of home
food, home comforts, and home warmth,
and the end is just the same. People
hopelessly ill should remain with their
friends; even California has no health
to give to those who cannot earn it, in
part at least, by their own exertions.
	It is true that the one-lunged peo-
ple form a considerable part of the
population of Southern California. It
is also true that no part of our Union
has a better population, and that many
of these men and women are now as
robust and vigorous as one could desire.
But this happy change is possible only
to those in the first stages of the dis-.
ease. Out-of-door life and physical ac-
tivity enable the system to suppress the
germs of disease, but clitnate without
activity does not cure. So far as cli-
mate is concerned, many parts of the
arid regions in Arizona, New Mexico,
and Colorado are more favorable than
California, because they are protected
from the chill of the sea. Another class
of health-seekers receives less sympathy
in California, and perhaps deserves less.
It is made up of jaundiced hypochondri-
acs and neurotic wrecks. These people
shiver in the California winter board-
ing-houses, torment themselves with en-
nui at the country ranches, poison them-
selves with nerve foods, and perhaps
finally survive to write the sad and
squalid  truth about California. Doubt-
less it is all inexpressibly tedious to them:
subjective woe is always hard to bear 
but it is not California.
	There are others, too, who are disaf-
fected, but I shall not stop to discuss
them or their points of view. It is
true, in general, that few to whom any-
thing else is anywhere possible find dis-
appointment in California.
	With all this, the social life is, in its
essentials, that of the rest of the United
States, for the same blood flows in the
veins of those whose influence dominates
it. Under all its deviations and varia-
tions lies the old Puritan conscience,
which is still the backbone of the civili</PB>

zation of the republic. Life there is a
little fresher, a little freer, a good deal
richer, in its physical aspects, but for
these reasons, possibly, more intensely
and characteristically American. With
perhaps ninety-five per cent of identity
there is five per cent of divergence, and
this five per cent I have emphasized
even to exaggeration. We know our
friends by their slight differences in fea-
ture or expression, not by their common
humanity. Much of this divergence is
already fading away. Scenery and cli-
mate remain, but there is less elbow-
room, and the unearned increment is
disappearing. That which is solid will
endure; the rest will vanish. The forces
that ally us to the East are growing
stronger every year with the immigra-
tion of men with new ideas. The vigor-
ous growth of the two universities in
California insures the elevation as well
as the retention of these ideas. In this
way, perhaps, California may contribute
something to the social development of
the East, and be a giver as well as a
receiver. But to the last certain traits
will persist. It is the most cosmopoli-
tan of all the states of the Union, and
such it will remain. Whatever the fates
may bring, the people will be tolerant,
hopeful, and adequate, sure of them-
selves, masters of the present, fearless
of the future.

THE WHOLESOME REVIVAL OF BYRON.

	THE simultaneous appearance of two
sumptuous editions of Byron, from the
presses of Messrs. Murray and Macmil-
lan, must have rather a puzzling effect
on certain critics and readers of poetry.
So much has been written of late years
about Wordsworth and Shelley, while
their quondam rival has been treated
with such contumelious silence, that the
disdainers of Byron had begun to feel
that the ground was entirely their own;
and the faithful few, who in secret
handed down the old Byron cult, must
have fallen into desperation,  for there
are still a few faithful, like the well-
known Greek scholar of whom it was
remarked in my hearing that he never
quoted any English save Byron and the
Bible. But apart from these scoffers
and idolaters, there are some who re-
cognize fully all the imperfections of
Byrons work, and yet regard the re-
cent exaltation of Shelley and Words-
worth so high above him as indicative
of an effeminate and oversubtilized taste.

new editions must be welcome as a pro-
mise of renewed interest in the poet, and
of a return to sounder principles of

	Much has been written about Byron;

upon Goethes saying, The moment he
reflects, he is a child. The dictum is
perfectly true. Byron as a philosopher
and critic is sadly deficient, oftentimes
puerile. But in fact he rarely reflects;
he is more often a child because he fails
to reflect at all. Predominance of intel-
lect does not necessarily imply true wis-
dom; for in reality an impulsive, restless
activity of mind seems often to militate
against calm reflection. It implies in
Byron rather keenness of wit, pungency
of criticism, whether sound or false, pre-
cision and unity of conception. So, in
the English Bards, the ruinous criticism
of Wordsworth,  that mild apostate
from poetic rule, is the expression of
an irresistible mental impetus, but it is
hardly reflection. When the poet came
to reflect on his satire, he wisely added
the comment, unjust. When in Childe
Harold he describes Gibbon as sapping
a solemn creed with solemn sneer, he
displays astonishing intellectual force in
summing up the effect of a huge work
in one keen memorable phrase, such
as can scarcely be paralleled from the
poetry of his age. And in this case he
is by chance right; reflection could not
modify or improve the judgment.
	In its larger effect this predominance
of intellect causes simplicity and tangi-
bility of general design. Thus, on read-
ing Manfred, we feel that a single and
very definite idea has been grasped and
held throughout; and we in turn receive
a single and definite impression, which
we readily carry away and reproduce in
memory. But turn to Shelleys Prome-
theus Unbound, and mark the difference.
However much the ordinary reader may
admire this drama, it is doubtful whe-
ther he could give any satisfactory ac-
count of its central idea, for the reason
that this idea has been diverted and
refracted through the medium of a way-
ward imagination, and is after all but
an illusion of the senses. Love, all-
embracing, victorious love, is in a sense
the motive of the poem; yet the most
superficial analysis will show this to be
an emotion or vague state of feeling,
rather than a distinct conception of the
intellect. The inconsistencies bewilder
the reader, although, on a rapid perusal,
they may escape his critical detection.
Love is the theme, yet the speeches are
full of the gall of hatred: in words Pro-
metheus may forgive his enemy, but the
animus of the poem is unrelenting bit-
terness.
	Yet the predominance of intellect,
which forms so important a factor in
what I have called classical art, is far
from excluding all emotion. On the
contrary, the simple elemental passions
naturally provoke intense activity of
mind. They almost inevitably, more-
over, lead to an art which depends on
broad effects instead of subtle and vague
impressions. The passion of Byron is
good evidence of this tendency. He
himself somewhere remarks that his
genius was eloquent rather than poetical,
and in a sense this observation is true.
His language has a marvelous sweep and
force that carry the reader on through
a sustained emotion, but in detail it is
prosaic in comparison with the iridescent
style of Shelley or of Keats. Marino
Faliero, one of Byrons less important
works, may be cited as a fair example
of his eloquence and concentrated pas-
sion. The theme of the drama is per-
fectly simple,  the conflict in Marinos
breast between aristocratic pride and the
love of liberty (predominant character-
istics, be it observed, of the poet him-
self) ; and about this conflict the whole
action of the play revolves, without any
minor issues to dissipate the effect. The
mind is held gripped to one emotion and
one thought; we seem to hear the mighty
pleading of a Demosthenes. There is
no poem of Shelleys (with the possible
exception of The Cenci, where he resorts
to monstrous and illegitimate means)
which begins to leave on the mind so
distinct and powerful an impression as
this, yet the whole drama contains per-</PB>

haps not a single line of the illusive
charm to be found in passages on every
page of Shelleys works. We know
from Byrons letters and prefaces that
he made a conscious effort to be, as he
himself calls it, classical in this respect.
Had his genius possessed also the subtle
grace of the more romantic writers, he
would have been classical in a still high-
er and broader sense; for the greatest
poets, the true classics, Homer as well
as Shakespeare, have embraced both
gifts. As it is, we are left to contrast
the vigorous, though incomplete, art of
Byron with the more wayward and ef-
feminate style of his rivals. And in this
we are justified by the known hostility
of Byron to the tendencies of his age
and by the utterances of the romantic
writers themselves, from whom a volume
of quotations might be culled showing
that they deliberately look on poetry as
a vehicle for the emotions and imagina-
tions of the heart alone.
	It was in no spirit of mere carping at
the present that Byron condemned the
romantic spirit, and waged continuous if
often indiscreet warfare for Milton and
Dryden and Pope. His indifference to
Shakespeare proves the sincerity of his
opinion, however it may expose the nar-
rowness of his judgment. He perceived
clearly a real kinship, on one side of his
genius, with Dryden and Pope, and was
sincere in his wish to follow them as
models. He was saved from their arid-
ity by the revolutionary spirit, which was
equally strong within him, and which he
acknowledged by partially condemning
\	himself with his contemporaries.
	Were the subject not too technical, the
radical difference between these classes
of poets might be shown by a study of
their use of metaphor. Poetry hardly
exists without metaphor. Besides the
formal simile there is in verse the more
pervasive use of metaphorical language,
by which the whole world of animate
and inanimate nature is brought into
similarity and kinship with the human
soul, so that our inner life is enlarged
and exalted by a feeling of universal do-
minion. The classical metaphor is sim-
ple and intellectual; through its means
the vague is fixed and presented clearly
to the mind by comparison with the more
definite, the complex by comparison with
the simple, the abstract with the con-
crete, the emotional with the sensuous.
Its rival, the romantic metaphor, appeals
to the fancy by the very opposite method.
It would be easy to take the Prometheus
Unbound aiid show how Shelley persist-
ently relaxes the mind by vague and ab-
stract similes. The moments are said
to crawl like death-worms; spring
is compared with the memory of a
dream, with genius, or joy which
riseth up as from the earth; the rush-
ing avalanche is likened to thought by
thought . . . piled up, till some great
truth is loosened, and the nations echo
round. In the famous and exquisitely
beautiful singing-metaphor of that poem
we have in miniature a perfect picture of
the romantic poets art: 
Meanwhile thy spirit lifts its pinions
In musics most serene dominions;
Catching the winds that fan that happy hea-
yen.
And we sail on, away, afar
	Without a course, without a star,
But by the instinct of sweet music driven.

Perhaps nowhere could a more perfect
expression of this wayward and delicate
spirit of romance be found, unless in that
brief phrase of A Winters Tale : 
A wild dedication of yourselves
	To unpathed waters, undreamed shores.
Take away this subtle and baffling over-
growth of the emotions, and the sturdier
metaphor of the classical poets remains.
Individual comparisons of this vague
character may no doubt be cited from
Byron (they are not altogether wanting
even in Homer), but they are in him dis-
tinctly exceptions. In general the poetic
medium in which he works has an intel-
lectual solidity akin to the older masters.
Poetry is the most perfect instrument</PB>

of expression granted us in our need of
self-utterance, and it is something to
have learned in what way this instru-
ment is shaped to the hand ~f a strong
poet. But this is not all. We desire to
know further the material he chooses
and how he treats it. How does he deal
with the great themes of literature? How
does he stand toward nature and man?
And here too we shall find a real con-
trast between Byron and his contem-
poraries.
	There is a scene in Mrs. Gaskells
Cranford which to me has always
seemed to set forth the aim of the mo-
mantic nature-poet in a charming light.
It is the bewitching chapter where the
ladies visit old Mr. Holbrook, the bache-
lor, and he, musing after dinner in the
garden, quotes and comments on Tenny-
son : 
The cedar spreads his dark-green layers of
shade.

Capital term  layers! Wonderful
man! . . . Why, when I saw the review
of his poems in Blackwood, I set off
within an hour, and walked seven miles
to Misselton (for the horses were not in
the way) and ordered them. Now, what
color are ash-buds in March?
	Is the man going mad? thought I.
He is very like Don Quixote.
	What color are they, I say? re-
peated he vehemently.
	 I am sure I dont know, sir, said
I, with the meekness of ignorance.
	 I knew you did nt. No more did
I  an old fool that I am !  till this
young man comes and tells me. Black
as ash-buds in March. And I ye lived
all nmy life in the country; more shame
for me not to know. Black: they are
jet-black, madam.
	Excellent botany, no doubt, and very
dainty verse; and yet I cannot think
the fame of the great masters of song
depends on such trivialities as this.
Black as ash-buds in 2k/larch,  one
might read all the famous epics of the
past without acquiring this curious bit
of informatiosm. Now it is perfectly
sure that, practically, all the verse-
makers of the present day look to nat-
ural description for their main theme,
and would clap their poetical hands as
in the joy of a vast inspiration over
one such novel bit of observation that
chanced to fall in their way. And in
this they have but carried to its extreme
tenuity tIme disposition of the romantic
poets, their forbears. There is a good
deal of this petty, prying nature-cult in
Keats and Shelley, along with inspiration
of a more solid or mystical quality. And
it is Wordsworth who chants over the
small celandine : 
Since the day I foand thee out,
Little flower!  I 11 make a stir,
Like a great astronomer.

	Some kinship of spirit, some haunting
echo of the revolutionary cry, binds us
very close to the singers of that age, and
we are perforce influenced by their at-
titude toward the outer world. It would
be a matter of curious inquiry to search
out the advent of this nature-worship
into poetry, and to trace it down through
later writers. Its growth and culmination
are in a way coincident with the revolu-
tionary period to which Byron belongs,
and, like most innovations of the kind, it
denotes both an enlargement and a loss of
idealism. The peculiar form of religious
enthusiasm developed in the Middle Ages
had wrought out its own idealism. The
soul of the individual man seemed to the
Christian of that day, as it were, the cen-
tre of the world, about which the divine
drama of salvation revolved; and on the
position taken by the individual in this
drama depended his eternal life. A
mans personality became of vast impor-
tance in the universal scheme of things,
and a new and justifiable egotism of in-
tense activity was born. There was ne-
cessarily an element of anguish in this
thought of personal importance and in-
security, but on the whole, while faith
lasted, it was overbalanced by feelings
of joy and peace; for, after all, salvation</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00811" SEQ="0811" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="805">	The Wholesome Revival of Byron.	805

was within reach. The idealism of such
a period found its aim in the perfection
of mans soul, and humanity in the life
of its individual members was the one
theme of surpassing interest. The new
humanism which came in with the Re-
naissance modified, but did not entirely
displant this ideal; the faith of the ear-
lier ages remained for a long time intact.
But by the closing years of the eighteenth
century the long illusion of mans per-
sonal value in the universe had been
rudely shattered; his anchor of faith had
been rent away. Then came the readjust-
ment which is still in progress, and is
still the cause of so much unrest and
tribulation. In place of the individual
arose a new ideal of humanity as a
whole,  a very pretty theory for phi-
losophers, but in no wise comforting for
the homeless soul of man, trained by
centuries of introspection to deem him-
self the chosen vessel of grace. There
was a season of revolt. The individual,
still bearing his burden of self-impor-
tance, and seeing now no restrictive laws
to bind him, gave himself to all the
wild vagaries of the revolutionary period.
Nor is it a matter of chance that Vol-
taire, the father of modera skepticism,
and Rousseau, the first of romantic na-
ture - worshipers, had worked together
to this end. It was under this stimulus
that those who were unable to silence the
inner need amidst the turmoil of action
turned to the outer world, seeking there
the comfort of an idealism not attainable
in the vague abstraction of humanity.
The individual found a new solace in
reverie, which seemed to make him one
with the wide and beneficent realm of
nature. The flattering trust in his own
eternal personality was undermined, the
unsubdued egotism born of the old faith
left him solitary amid mankind; he
turned for companionship to the new
world whose kinship to himself was so
newly discovered: 
Then stirs the feeling infinite, so felt
In solitude, where we are least alone;
A truth, which through our being then doth
melt
And purifies from self: it is a tone,
The soul and source of music, which makes
known
Eternal harmony, aud sheds a charm,
Like to the fabled Cythereas zone,
Binding all things with beauty;  t would
disarm
The spectre Death, had he substantial power to
harm.

	An eternal harmony did indeed spring
from this new source of music; it was a
substantial gain, a new-created idealism
in poetry. But we should not shut our
eyes to the concomitant danger and foss.
In this flattering absorption, into nature
the poet was too apt to forget that, after
all, the highest and noblest theme must
forever be the struggle of the human
soul; he was too ready to substitute
vague reverie for honest thought, and
to lose his higher sympathy with man in
the eager pursuit of minute phenomena.
We are all familiar with the travestied
nature-cult to be seen especially in un-
attached women, who seek in this way
an outlet for unemployed emotions such
as formerly they found in religious en-
thusiasm. There is, alas, too much of
this petty sentimentality in the verse of
the day. We turn to the earlier bards
of the century, the founders of this new
religion, for guidance and inspiration,
and too often we imitate their weakness
instead of their strength. Wordsworth
has made a stir over the small celandine,
and Tennyson has discovered that ash-
buds are black in March; the present
generation must, for originality, examine
the fields with a botanists lens, while the
poor reader, who retains any use of his
mind, is too often reminded of the poet
Grays shrewd witticism, that he learnt
botany to save himself the trouble of
thinking. If for no other reason, we are
justified in calling attention to Byron,
who in his treatment of nature shows the
same breadth and mental scope, the same
human sympathy, which characterize his
classical use of metaphor.</PB>

There is a curious passage in one of
Franklins letters, where the philosopher
attempts to prove by experiment that
the perception of form is remembered
more clearly than the perception of
color. I am not sure that his expla-
nation of this phenomenon is strictly
scientific, but the fact is indisputable.
Form and motion of form are clearly
defined, intelligible, so to speak; color
is illusive and impressionistic. So, it
will be remembered, the Greeks were
preiiminent in their imitation of form;
the Renaissance artists excelled in color.
Distinctions of this kind, to be sure, are
a matter of degree only, but none the
less significant for that. Now there
are descriptions in Byron of gorgeous
coloring, notably in certain stanzas of
the Haid6e episode; but even here the
colors are sharply defined, and there is
little of the blending, iridescent light of
romance, 
The light that never was on sea or land,
The consecration and the poets dream
and in general Byron dwells on form
and action in his presentation of na-
ture, whereas his contemporaries, and
notably Shelley, revel in her variety of
hues.
	It is curious, in fact, that many who
are prone to dignify emotional reverie
as thought would ascribe such predomi-
nance of intellect to shallowness, just as
they would deem the breadth of Byrons
natural description due to narrowness
of observation. You will indeed find
in Byron no poems on the small celan-
dine, or the daisy, or the cuckoo, or the
nightingale, or the west wind; but you
may find pictures of mountains reared
like the palaces of nature, of the free
bounding ocean, of tempest on sea and
storm among the Alps, of the solitary
pine woods, of placid Lake Leman,  of
all the greater, sublimer aspects of na-
ture, such as can hardly be paralleled
elsewhere in English literature.
	Byron was too much a child of his
age to escape the longing for mystic
fellowship with nature which came in
with the century, and still, in milder
form perhaps, troubles mankind. But
even here there are in him a firmness
and a directness of utterance which dis-
tinguish his work from the more flaccid
rhapsodies of his romantic rivals. Let
us by all means retain as a precious and
late-won possession this sense of com-
munion with the fair outlying world,
but let us at the same time beware of
loosening our grip on realities. I know
no better palliative for the insidious re-
laxing sentimentality that lurks in such
brooding contemplation than certain
well-known passages of Childe Harold,
such as 
I live not in myself, but I become
	Portion of that around me;
or,
There is a pleasure in the pathless woods;
or,
Clear, placid Leman! thy contrasted lake.

	It is again the classic element in By-
rons art which saves him from shadowy,
meaningless words; and he is assisted
also by his intense human passiotis and
personality. I have indeed intimated
that the preponderance of human in-
terest is an essential feature of the
classical spirit; it would have been
easy to show that, along with predomi-
nance of intellect and breadth, this hu-
man interest is everywhere present in
Byrons work; but the humanism  the
egotism, if you choose  is so universally
recognized in his character that any de-
tailed exposition of its presence in his
poetry seemed superfluous. Only in his
treatment of nature, perhaps, ought spe-
cial attention to be called to this trait,
for here most of all he differs from cer-
tain of the romantic writers. It is well
to remember that now and always the
proper study of mankind is man. We
need still to reflect on the wise admoni-
tion of St. Augustine: And men go
abroad to gaze at the lofty mountains,
and the great waves of the sea, and the</PB>

wide flowing of rivers, and the circle of
ocean, and the revolutions of the stars,
and pass themselves, the crowning won-
der, by. This genuine human interest
distinguished Byron from the pseudo-
classical writers as well, who would ethe-
realize predominance of intellect into in-
animate abstractions,  from those thin-
blooded poets of the last century whose
art depended on a liberal distribution of
capital letters.
	At bottom Byrons sympathy is not
with nature, but with man, and in the
expression of this sympathy he displays
the sturdy strength of classic art. Th~o-
phile Gautier, in his study of Villon, has
a clever appeal for the minor bards.
The most highly vaunted passages of
the poets, he says, are ordinarily com-
monplaces. Ten verses of Byron on love,
on the brevity of life, or on some other
subject equally as new will find more
admirers than the strangest vision of
Jean Paul or of Hoffmann: this is be-
cause very many have been or are in
love, and a still greater number are
fearful of death, but very few, even in
dreams, have beheld the fantastic images
of the German story-tellers pass before
them. Gautier himself, as one of the
fantastics, may be prejudiced in their
favor, but his characterization of Byron
is eminently right. It is a fact that the
great poets, the classic poets, deal very
much with commonplaces, but Gautier
should know his Horace well enough to
remember that nothing is more difficult
than the art of giving these common-
places an individual stamp.
	Here again it may be wise to turn
for a while from the romantic poets who
search out the wayward, obscure emotions
of the heart to one who treated almost ex-
clusively those simple, fundamental pas-
sions which are most compatible with pre-
dominance of intellect and breadth of ex-
pression. I hardly know where in English
literature, outside of Shakespeare, one is
to find the great passions of men set forth
so directly and powerfully as in Byron,
and on this must rest his final claim to
serious consideration. It is said that By-
ron could never get outside of himself
and this, to a certain extent, is true. He
lacked the dramatic art; but, on the
other hand, his own human passions were
so strong, his life was so vigorous, that
from personal experience he was able to
accomplish more than most others whose
sympathies might be wider. His range
is by no means universal, and yet what
masterly pictures he has drawn of love
and hate, of patriotism, honor, disdain,
sarcasm, revenge, remorse, despair, awe,
and mockery! If he had touched the
passion of love alone, he would still be
worthy of study. It is wholesome now
and again to forget the ethereal heights
where Cythna dwells, and linger by the
sea with Haid6e, the pure and innocent
child of nature. Love in Byron is com-
monly the lust which enslaves and de-
grades, or it is the instinctive attraction of
youth uncorrupted of the world,  that
simple self-surrender, unquestioning and
unpolluted, which to the aged sight of
the wise Goethe and weary Renan seemed,
after all, the best and truest thing in life.
Other poets in search of loves mystic
shadow have philosophized with Plato
or scaled the empyrean with Dante; but
rarely in these excursions have they
avoided the perils of unreality or self-
deception, of inanity or morbidness. It
is at least safer to see in love the simple
animal passion, pure or perverted as the
case may be.
	And this brings us to the vexed ques-
tion of Byrons morality. I would not
appear to excuse his shortcomings in
this respect, and yet I think the evil of
his work has been much exaggerated.
His aggressive free-thinking, which so
shocked his contemporaries, can scarcely
do more than elicit a smile to-day ; the
grossly sensual passages in his poems
are few, and these are more outspoken
than seductive; his sneers are mostly for
cant and bypocrisy, which, God knows,
deserved such lashing then as they do</PB>

now. And withal his mind was right;
he never deceived himself. Many times
he refers to the ruin of his own life, and
always he puts his finger on the real
source of the evil, his lack of self-re-
straint and his revolt from conventions.
There is something manly and pathetic
at once, not without strange foreboding
of what was to come, in these lines from
Childe Harold : 
If my fame should be, as my fortunes are,
Of hasty growth and blight, and dull Oblivion
bar

My name from out the temple where the
dead
Are honourd by the nations  let it be 
And light the laurels on a loftier head!
And be the Spartans epitaph on me 
Sparta hath many a worthier son than he.
Meantime Iseek no sympathies, nor need;
The thorns which I have reap d are of the
tree
I planted,  they have torn me,  and I
bleed:
I should have known what fruit would spring
from such a seed.

	In his Epistle to Augusta, perhaps
the noblest of all his shorter poems, he
more explicitly mentions the evil that
brought about his ruin: 
I have been cunning in mine overthrow,
The careful pilot of my proper woe.

Mine were my faults, and mine be their re-
ward.
	My whole life was a contest, since the day
That gave me being, gave me that which
marrd
The gift,  a fate, or will, that walkd
astray.~~

	I cannot refrain from quoting, by way
of contrast, the words of Mrs. Shelley
in regard to her wayward companion.
In all Shelley did, she says, he, at
the time of doing it, believed himself jus-
tified to his own conscience. This, sure-
ly, is the inner falsehood, more deadly,
as Plato affirmed, than the spoken lie;
and I am sufficiently a Platonist to be-
lieve that in this glozing of evil lies the
veritable danger to morals. There is no
such insidious disease in Byrons mind.
	The errors of Byron, both in conduct
and in art, were in fact largely due to
the revolutionary spirit which so easily
passed into licentiousness. Classical art
should result in self-restraint and perfec-
tion of form, but to this Byron never at-
tained except spasmodically, almost by
accident it would seem. So far he is
classical that he almost universally dis-
plays predominance of intellect, breadth
of treatment, and human interest; but
side by side with this principle of limita-
tion runs the other spirit of revolt, pro-
ducing at times that extraordinary in-
congruity of effect which has so baffled
his later audience. The world, after
manifold struggles, had begun to throw
off the medimeval ideals; faith in the in-
finite and eternal value of the human
person, with all its earthly desires and
ambitions, with its responsibility to a
jealous God, had been rudely shaken;
nor had that deeper faith taken hold of
the mind wherein this laboring, grasping,
earthly self is seen to be but a shadow,
an obscuration, of something vastly great-
er, hidden in secr~t places of the heart.
Belief in the divine right of rulers had
been burst as an insubstantial bubble,
but in the late-born ideal of a humanity
bound in brotherhood and striving up-
ward together the individual was very
slow to feel the drawing of the new ties;
he had revolted from the past, and still
felt himself homeless and unattached in
the shadowy ideals of the future. In
such an age Byron was born, a man of
superabundant physical vigor which at
anytime would have ill brooked restraint,
and of mental impetuosity which had by
nature something of the tiger in it. He
was led at first by the very spirit of the
age to glory in physical and mental li-
cense and to exaggerate his impatience
at restraint, and only by the hard ex-
perience of life did he learn, or partly
learn, the lesson of moderation. Natu-
rally his poetry often reflected his tem-
perament in its lack of discipline.
	I have dwelt at length on the strength</PB>

of Byron~s art, but I would not slur
over his deficiencies. No one can be
more conscious of these deficiencies than
the present writer, whose recent task it
has been to read through Byrons works
with an editors questioning eye. His
language is often  very often  slip-
shod, made obscure by endless anacolu-
thons, disfigured by frequent lapses into
bad grammar; the thought and style of
certain poems  The Prophecy of Dante,
for instance  are so cheap as to render
the reading of them a labor of necessity;
yet all this hardly affects his importance
for us. We are not likely to learn bad
grammar from him, and his dull poems
are easily passed over. He wrote, to use
his own words, as the tiger leaps; and
if he missed his aim, there was no re-
trieving the failure. We call this lack
of artistic conscience, and so it is; but
in these days of pedantic ~esthetes, it is
refreshing now and again to surrender
ourselves to the impulse of untrammeled
genius. And then, if Byron often failed,
he sometimes hit the mark. There are
passages  more than that, there are
whole poems  wherein his classical
method has dominated the license of re-
volt sufficiently to achieve almost perfect
harmony of form, while still retaining the
full vigor of his imperious inspiration.
	But the inner spirit of his poems was
affected even more than his art by the
new ferment. To do anything like jus-
tice to the psychology of Byron would
require a separate study in itself; and
if the subject is here passed lightly over,
this is because it seems, on the whole,
less important at the present moment
than the analysis of his art, and because
it has already been treated with consid-
erable acumen. Every one recognizes
at a glance the tormented personality
and the revolutionary leaven in Byrons
spirit; not every one, perhaps, would
comprehend immediately the extraor-
dinary result pro(luced by the union of
these with his classical method,  a re
sult so extraordinary as alone to lend per-
manent interest to his work. And this
interest is heightened by the rapid change
and development in his character.
There are four pretty clearly defined
periods in his life, although as always
these overlap one another to a certain
extent. First we see the youthful sati-
rist lashing friend and foe with irresisti-
ble bitterness, as if his egregious ego-
tism could find relief only in baying at
the world; then follows a second phase
of revolt, taking pleasure in melodra-
matic isolation from society, exulting in
moody revenge and unutterable myste-
ries, stalking before the world in gor-
geous Oriental disguise; out of this ex-
travagance grows the Byron of the later
Childe Harold, who would unburden his
soul of its self-engendered torture in sol-
itary communion with nature, and would
find relief from the vulgar cant of the
present in profound reflection on the
grandeurs of the past; and last, when
even these fail him, the self-mocking
Don Juan, with his strange mixture of
sweet and bitter, infinitely heavy-hearted
at bottom, who cries out in the end 
Now . . Imagination droops her pinion,
And the sad truth that hovers oer my desk
Turns what was once romantic to burlesque.

And if I laugh at any mortal thing,
	T is that I may not weep; and if I weep,
T is that our nature cannot always bring
	Itself to apathy.

He was saved, indeed, from the final si-
lence of apathy by an early death. Yet
it has always seemed to me that for one
brief moment,  when, after escaping
the vexatious of his ruined domestic life,
he wrote his Epistle to Augusta from
the solitudes of Switzerland,  Byron
caught, dim and distorted it may be, a
glimpse of divine wisdom, which, if fol-
lowed, might have rendered him great
among the wisest. But some Nemesis of
fate, some error of will, swept him back
into the bondage of darkness, from which
he never escaped.

	THE library of Harvard University
received in 1874, as part of the bequest
of Charles Sumner, a copy of The Poems
of Ossian in two volumes, which has
been carefully guarded as one of the
treasures of the university. The edi-
tion (London, 1806) is not a notable
one; but that Sumner, in paying twenty
guineas for it, drove a good bargain will
be seen from a printed slip affixed above
the Harvard book-plate, which describes
the volumes as a unique and most valu-
able copy, having extensive original anno-
tations in the autograph of Lord Byron,
and his signature on the fly-leaf of each
volume. At the end of the first volume
is an original unpublished poem in his
autograph, being a rendering into verse
of Ossians Address to the Sun.
	Byr9ns notes on Ossian and his ver-
sion of a portion of Carthon make no
addition to what, in the good old-fash-
ioned sense, we used to call literature;
for the notes are intrinsically of no
value, and the value of the poem itself
may fairly be a matter of dispute. But
even the scraps from a great authors
waste-basket, if discreetly adjusted, have
a certain definite biographical interest;
and Byrons notes furnish a pleasant lit-
tle commentary on his critical ineptitude,
and his poem gives additional evidence,
if any were needed, of his astonishing
facility. With two exceptions, the notes
are of so general a nature that when
brought together they give a fair, al-
though disjointed idea of Byrons criti-
cal estimate of Ossian.
	The first note is on the fly-leaf of the
first volume: The early and unculti-
vated periods of society, in which the
age of Ossian must doubtless be ranked,
were most favorable to the display of
original poetical genius. Such a period
will always be found to have the happi-
est influence on sentimental and descrip
tive poetry, whether sublime or pathetic;
though it must likewise be granted that
civilized life will for the most part in-
troduce a greater variety of incidents
and character into poetical composition.
	After the poem Carthon, with which
Byron was apparently most strongly im-
pressed, he wrote on a blank page:
That the poet possesses the talent of
raising to a great degree both the ten-
der and more violent passions of the
mind by his sentiments as well as by his
descriptions will not be questioned by
those who are themselves possessed of
the smallest share of sensibility, and have
read his poems with any measure of at-
tention. These indeed are almost con-
stantly addressed to the affections and
to the heart, over which he maintains
an absolute and uncontrolled power.
On the blank page after the table of con-
tents of the second volume, and sprawling
across the false title of Fingal, Byron
begins to grow more definite, and, if any-
thing, more courageous: The portrait
which Ossian has drawn of himself is in-
deed a masterpiece. He not only appears
in the light of a distinguished warrior,
generous as well as brave, and possessed
of exquisite sensibility, but of an aged,
venerable bard, subjected to the most
melancholy vicissitudes of fortune, 
weak and blind, the sole survivor of his
family, the last of the race of Fingal.
	The character of Fingal, the poets
own father, is a highly finished one.
There is certainly no hero in the Iliad
or the Odyssey who is at once so brave
and amiable as this renowned king of
Morven. It is well known that Hector,
whose character is of all the Homeric
heroes the most complete, greatly sul-
lies the lustre of his glorious actions by
the insult over the fallen Patroclus. On
the other hand, the conduct of Fingal
appears uniformly illustrious and great,</PB></P>

is an original unpublished poem in his
autograph, being a rendering into verse
of Ossians Address to the Sun.
	Byr9ns notes on Ossian and his ver-
sion of a portion of Carthon make no
addition to what, in the good old-fash-
ioned sense, we used to call literature;
for the notes are intrinsically of no
value, and the value of the poem itself
may fairly be a matter of dispute. But
even the scraps from a great authors
waste-basket, if discreetly adjusted, have
a certain definite biographical interest;
and Byrons notes furnish a pleasant lit-
tle commentary on his critical ineptitude,
and his poem gives additional evidence,
if any were needed, of his astonishing
facility. With two exceptions, the notes
are of so general a nature that when
brought together they give a fair, al-
though disjointed idea of Byrons criti-
cal estimate of Ossian.
	The first note is on the fly-leaf of the
first volume: The early and unculti-
vated periods of society, in which the
age of Ossian must doubtless be ranked,
were most favorable to the display of
original poetical genius. Such a period
will always be found to have the happi-
est influence on sentimental and descrip
tive poetry, whether sublime or pathetic;
though it must likewise be granted that
civilized life will for the most part in-
troduce a greater variety of incidents
and character into poetical composition.
	After the poem Carthon, with which
Byron was apparently most strongly im-
pressed, he wrote on a blank page:
That the poet possesses the talent of
raising to a great degree both the ten-
der and more violent passions of the
mind by his sentiments as well as by his
descriptions will not be questioned by
those who are themselves possessed of
the smallest share of sensibility, and have
read his poems with any measure of at-
tention. These indeed are almost con-
stantly addressed to the affections and
to the heart, over which he maintains
an absolute and uncontrolled power.
On the blank page after the table of con-
tents of the second volume, and sprawling
across the false title of Fingal, Byron
begins to grow more definite, and, if any-
thing, more courageous: The portrait
which Ossian has drawn of himself is in-
deed a masterpiece. He not only appears
in the light of a distinguished warrior,
generous as well as brave, and possessed
of exquisite sensibility, but of an aged,
venerable bard, subjected to the most
melancholy vicissitudes of fortune, 
weak and blind, the sole survivor of his
family, the last of the race of Fingal.
	The character of Fingal, the poets
own father, is a highly finished one.
There is certainly no hero in the Iliad
or the Odyssey who is at once so brave
and amiable as this renowned king of
Morven. It is well known that Hector,
whose character is of all the Homeric
heroes the most complete, greatly sul-
lies the lustre of his glorious actions by
the insult over the fallen Patroclus. On
the other hand, the conduct of Fingal
appears uniformly illustrious and great,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00817" SEQ="0817" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="811">	An Unpublished Poem by Byron.	811

without one mean or inhuman action to
tarnish the splendour of his fame. He
is equally the object of our admiration,
esteem, and love.
	The next note is in the second volume,
at the beginning of the second book of
Fingal. The italics are, of course, By-
rons.
	One of the most consummate char-
acters which the poet has contributed
is that of Connal. This hero is the
Ulysses of Ossian, though he is a far
more complete charn~ter than the Grecian
chief. Like him, he is distinguished by
his profound wisdom, by his cautious
prudence, and by his calm, temperate
valour. But he is free of that cunning
and artifice which so much distinguish
Ulysses, and which rather diminish than
aggrandize the true hero.
	Ossians female characters are less
distinctly marked. It was unnecessary
to draw their pictures at full length, not
being engaged in the active scenes of life,
except when they sometimes attend their
lovers in disguise. The poet, however,
has hit off some striking features even
of these. How happily, for instance,
has he characterized his own mistress,
afterwards his wife, by a single epithet,
expressive of that modesty, softness, and
complacency which constitute the perfec-
tion of feminine excellence: the mildly
blushing Everallin.
	Finally, we have Byrons summing up
of the whole matter on the four blank
pages at the end of the book. I am of
opinion, he somewhat magnificently con-
cludes, that though in sublimity of sen-
timent, in vivacity and strength of de-
scription, Ossian may claim a full equality
of merit with Homer himself, yet in the
invention both of incidents and charac-
ters he is greatly inferior to the Grecian
bard. This inferiority, however, evi-
dently proceeds from the different peri-
ods of society in which the poets lived.
Though the age in which Homer wrote
his Iliad was far from being polished,
yet were the arts of civility much farther
advanced than they were in the age in
which Ossian composed Fingal and Te-
mora; and therefore it must have been
easier for Homer to present us with a
variety of characters, which he might
partly have copied from life, partly
created, and partly derived from tradi-
tion,  a source which in Greece could
have supplied him with greater abun-
dance both of incidents and characters
for the conduct of an epic poem, than it
could have done for Ossian, who had no
materials for his imagination to work
upon excepting what he collected from
his own observation, and from the songs
of preceding bards, either or both of
which could afford little variety of char-
acters or incidents in our unpolished
age.
	It further deserves attention that Os-
sian never thought of trying the strength
of his genius in the invention of the one
or the other, which would by no means
have corresponded with his design; and
if he had, it is impossible he should ever
have succeeded in it as Homer has done,
unless he had lived in the age and coun-
try of Homer.
	Even if we did not know that Byrons
criticisms, when not of the splenetic and
underbred Johnny Keats kind, were
characteristically immature, we should
attribute this to a youthful writer; for
although the slight grandiloquence and
the occasional excellent balance of the
style give it an almost elderly, Johuso-
nian effect, the very cocksureness of tone
and the superficiality of taste betray the
youth of the critic. But at no time had
Byrons prose a more pompous elderli-
ness of tone than when he was between
the ages of fifteen and twenty. Take
this, almost at random, written to his
sister in his sixteenth year: Although,
My ever Dear Augusta, I have hitherto
appeared remiss in replying to your
kind and affectionate letters; yet I hope
you will not attribute my neglect to a
want of affection, but rather to a shy-
ness naturally inherent in my Disposi</PB>

tion. I will now endeavour as amply as
lies in my power to repay your kind-
ness, and for the future I hope you will
consider me not only as a Brother, but
as your warmest and most affectionate
Friend, and if ever Circumstances should
require it, your protector. The super-
ficiality of taste is obvious in the discus-
sion of Homer, where Byron writes more
like a schoolboy than like a man whose
mature soul has been moved by the great
Greek.
	Even if we did not know that Byrons
knowledge of books was limited ( Lord
Byrons reading, Scott wrote of him in
1815, did not seem to me to have been
very extensive either in poetry or his-
tory), we should attribute the notes
on Ossian to a youthful writer; for no
grown man of letters could be so mag-
nificently ignorant of the contempt in
which Macphersons semi-forgeries were
held by many. Thirty-one years before
Byrons copy of Ossian was printed, Dr.
Johnson challenged Macphersons hon-
esty, and on Macphersons threatening
him, after procuring a stout cudgel he
wrote his famous reply, in which occurs
the splendid phrase, I hope I shall
never be deterred from detecting what
I think a cheat, by the menaces of a
ruffian. And on another occasion the
doctor had exclaimed of the Ossianic
translations, Sir, a man might write
such stuff forever, if he would abandon
his mind to it. As early, indeed, as
1760, Gray doubted whether Macpher-
sons Fragments of Ancient Poetry were
the invention of antiquity or of a mod-
erri Scotchman. But with Dr. Johnson
alone in one pan of the critical scale,
Lord Byron is bound to count for lit-
tle in the other. Still, it is only fair to
Byron to admit that in this instance Dr.
Johnsons antipathy for the Scotch car-
ried him farther than posterity is now
willing to follow; and that greater men
than Byron, and critics older and at
least as well equipped, swallowed Mac-
pherson as completely as Byron did. It
is, furthermore, but fair to Byron to
add that his copy of Ossian is prefaced
with nearly two hundred pages of what
purports to be an impartial discussion of
the Ossianic controversy, but is chiefly
a reprint of Macphersons preface and
Dr. Blairs incredibly dull and one-sided
critical dissertntion supporting the so-
called translator. It is much to be doubt-
ed, indeed, that Byron had the patience
to read any of the preliminary matter.
It was not until the following year, 1807,
that Laings critical edition put Macpher-
son in more nearly a proper light.
	Here we have, I think, good evidence
as to the date of Byrons notes. For in
the same year that Laings Ossian ap-
peared Byron published his Hours of
Idleness, in which he included an imi-
tation of Ossian, The Death of Calmar
and Orla. At the end of this he ap-
pends the following somewhat regretful
note: I fear Laings late edition has
completely overthrown every hope that
Macphersons Ossian might prove the
translation of a series of Poems, com-
plete in themselves; but while the im-
posture is discovered, the merit of the
work remains undisputed, though not
without faults, particularly, in some
parts, turgid and bombastic diction. The
present humble imitation will be par-
doned by the admirers of the original,
as an attempt, however inferior, which
evinces an attachment to their favourite
author. Clearly, then, by 1807 Byron
had read Ossian carefully enough to
imitate it with moderate success ( Sir,
a man might write such stuff forever, if
he would abandon his mind to it!);
and at least by the time Hours of Idle-
ness was in press (1807) he hnd been in-
formed of the spurious nature of most
of his model. His own copy of Ossian,
dated 1806, is filled with notes expres-
sive of nothing but enthusiastic admira-
tion, and showing no consciousness of
turgid and bombastic diction. Obvi-
ously, even if internal evidence were
wanting, the notes were written either</PB>

in 1806 or in the early part of 1807,
or, in other words, when Byron was
about the age of eighteen.
	If this date be accepted, one re-reads
the notes with a heightened interest, for
as the production of a youth of eighteen
they are fairly notable in style; and
when that youth is Byron, the indica-
tion they give of several traits of the
writer which afterwards became more
marked is very significant. Thackeray
said of him, many years later, more
sweepingly, perhaps, than fairly: That
man never wrote from his heart; he
got up rapture and enthusiasm with an
eye to the public. And even in these
early notes, whether we accept in full
or not Thackerays savage dictum, By-
ron seems almost to set his manuscript
in one eye and the public in the other.
Again, his admiration of that modesty,
softness, and complacency which con-
stitute the perfection of feminine excel-
lence, shows that very early he cher-
ished the somewhat gazelle-like ideal
that, in one form or another, he was al-
ways faithful to. But to me the most
interesting note is one written on the
margin of page 194 of the first volume,
which I have not previously given. The
passage in Carthon which follows, Byron
has underscored: Why dost thou build
the hall, son of the winged days? Thou
lookest from thy towers to-day; yet a
few years, and the blast of the desert
comes; it howls in thy empty court, and
whistles round thy half-worn shield.
Whereat Byron exclaims, This striking
and beautiful sentiment is the natural
dictate of that contemplative disposition,
united with that melancholy which dis-
tinguishes every great genius, and which
seems remarkably to have distinguished
the character of Ossian. Here, finally,
we have Byron ipsustmus.
	For fidelity to the text, for compact-
ness of expression (with the exception of
a single passage), for rhythmic fluency,
Byrons metrical version of Ossians Ad-
dress to the Sun, which follows, is supe
nor to any performance of a like nature,
by a youth of eighteen, with which I
am familiar. The manuscript of the
poem covers the four blank pages at the
end of the first volume. It is apparent-
ly rapidly written, with but a single era-
sure; and I have followed the text ac-
curately, with the exception of the punc-
tuation. Throughout notes and poem
Byrons punctuation consists almost ex-
clusively of dashes,  a system which
commends itself to the reader but little
more than that of another noble author,
Lord Timothy Dexter.


A VERSION OF OSSIANS ADDRESS
TO THE SUN.

O thou! who rollest in yon azure field,
Round as the orb of my forefathers shield,
Whence are thy beams? From what eternai
store
Dost thou, 0 Sun! thy vast effulgence pour?
In awful grandeur, when thou movest on high,
The stars start back aud hide them in the
sky;
The pale moon sickens in thy brightening
blaze,
And in the western wave avoids thy gaze.
Alone thou shinest forth  for who can rise
Companion of thy splendour in the skies!
The mountain oaks are seen to fall away;
Mountains themselves by length of years de-
cay;
With ebbs and flows is the rough Ocean tost;
In heaven the moon is for a season lost;
But thou, amidst the fullness of thy joy,
The same art ever, blazing in the sky!
When tempests wrap the world from pole to
pole,
When vivid lightuings flash and thunders roll,
Thou, far above their utmost fury borne,
Lookst forth in beauty, laughing them to
scorn.
But vainly now on me thy beauties blaze;
Ossian no longer can enraptured gaze!
Whether at morn, in lucid lustre gay,
On eastern clouds thy yellow tresses play,
Or else at eve, in radiant glory drest,
Thou tremblest at the portals of the west,
I see no more! But thou mayest fail at
length;
Like Ossian lose thy beauty and thy strength;
Like him, but for a season, in thy sphere
To shine with splendour, then to disappear!
Thy years shall have an end, and thou no
more

Wherefore dost not obey? Speak on

Wherefore dost not speak, son of an

	The voice was childish, fretful. So
was the listless little figure in a flannel

half against the red and yellow livery

mained silent, his dark eyes fixed depre-
catingly on a taller figure within ear-shot.

high-bred, sensitive face, which had not
quivered under the parentage assigned
to him by the thin, domineering voice,
melted at the appeal, and the red and
yellow arms seemed to close round their
charge at the very suggestion of sickness.
Bisram gave another deprecating glance
at the tall white figure at the door, and
then from the folds of his waistcloth took
out a silk handkerchief crumpled into a
ball; but a dexterous flutter left it in un-
creased folds across the childs knees.
	Lo! Protector of the Poor! such is
the noose of K~li, said Bisram defer-
entially.
	Seen thus, the handkerchief looked
larger than one would have expected;
or perhaps it is more correct to say
longer, for the texture being loose like
canvas, even the slight drag across the
childs knees stretched the stuff length-
wise. It was of that curious Indian
color called oodcth, which is not purple
or crimson, but which looks as if it had
been the latter and might become the
former; the color, briefly, of recently
spilt blood. It looked well, however,
in the soft, lustrous folds lying upon the
childs white dressing-gown. He smiled
down at it joyfully, yet not content, since
there was more to come.
	Twist it for Mai K&#38; li,  twist it,
Bisram bearer! Ai! base-born, twist it,
or I will smite.
	It is time for the Shelter of the
World to take his medicine, began Bis-
ram, interrupting the imperious little
voice. Lo! does his honor not see the
men~ waiting for him?
	Sonny gave a quick glance at his mo-
ther. He knew his power there, also.
Ise not goin to take it, mum, he called
decisively, till he s twisted a noose 
I wont  I want a stwangle somefin
first. Tell him, mum  pleath. Then
I 11 waller it like a good boy.
	Do what he wants, Bisram, and then
bring him here, said Sonnys mother,
her eyes soft. For the child had but
lately chosen the path of Life instead of
the Valley of the Shadow, so even way-
ward footsteps along it were welcome.
	Now is it government orders, boast-
ed Sonny, reverting to the precisions and
peremptoriness of Hindustani with a
wave of his small hand. So twist and
stwangle; and if thou dost it not, my fa-
ther will cause hanging to come to thee.
	Huzoor! assented Bisram cheer-
fully, as he shifted his burden slightly so
as to free his left hand. The next in-
stant a purple-crimson rope of a thing
circled on itself settled down upon the
neck of a big painted mud tiger, bright
yellow with black stripes and fiery red
eyes, which one of the native visitors had
brought that morning for the magistrates
little son.
	Now the Protector of the Poor can
pull, said Bisram bearer; it will not
slip.
	But Sonnys wan little face had per-
plexity and doubt in it. But, Bisra,
Mai K~li rides a tiger. She would nt
stwangle it; would she, mum? I would
nt stwangle my pony. I d watber stwan-
gle the gwoom, would nt you, mum? I
would. I d wather like to stwangle
Gamoo.
	My dear Sonny! exclaimed his
mother, looking with amused horror at
the still helpless little figure which Bis-
ram had brought to her. You would
nt murder poor Gamoo, surely!
	Sonny made faces over his quinine, as
if that were a matter of much more im-
portance.
	Ees I would, he said, with his mouth
full of sweet biscuits. I d stwangle
him, and then Mai K~li would be pleathed
for a fousand years; and then I d
stwangle Dittoo an Reroo too; so she d
be pleathed for a fousand, fousand years,
would nt she, Bisra ?
	Huzoor! assented Bisram bearer.
	My dear, said Sonnys mother, go-
ing back with a somewhat disturbed look
to the room where the magistrate, Son-
nys father, was busy over crabbed San-
skrit texts and bright-colored tale pie-</PB>

tures; (for in his leisure hours he was
compiling a Hindoo Pantheon for the
use of students), I almost wish Bisram
would not tell Sonny so many stories
about the gods and goddesses. They do
such horrid things.
	The scholar, who in his heart nour-
ished a hope that his son might in due
time follow in his footsteps, and perhaps
gain reputation where his father only
found amusement, looked up from his
books mildly.
	Gods and goddesses always do, my
dear. Their morality seldom conforms
to that which obtains among their wor-
shipers. I intend to draw special atten-
tion to this anomaly. Besides, Sonny
will have to learn these things anyhow
when he begins Greek and Latin; he
will in fact find this previous knowledge
of grea~t use. K~li, for instance, is the
terrific form of Durga, who of course
corresponds to the Juno of the Greeks
and Romans, and the Isis of Egypt. She
is also the crescent-crowned Diana and
the Rarbutto Earth Mother Ceres. Un-
der the name of Atma again she is god-
dess of souls governing the three worlds,
and so equivalent to Hecate Triformis.
	Yes, my dear, interrupted his wife
meekly.  But for all that, I dont
want Sonny to talk of strangling the
grooms; it really does nt sound nice.
However, as Bisram is eager, now Sonny
is really recovering, to get away at once
for his usual leave, I wont say anything
to the child. He will forget while Bis-
ram is away, and I will give orders that
the latter is not to mention the subject
on his return.
	Bisram himself, receiving his pay and
his orders ere starting on the yearly vis-
it to his own country, which was the only
portion of his life by day or night not
absolutely  without any reservation
whatever  at the disposal of his em-
ployers, fully acquiesced in the mem
sahibs dictum. The noose of K~1i was
scarcely a nice game for the little mas-
ter; indeed, his slave would never have
introduced it under ordinary circum-
stances. But the mem must remember
that dreadful day, when the Hearts Eye
lay so still, caring for nothing, and the
doctor sahib had said there was nothing
to be done save to coax him into look-
ing into the restless Face of Life instead
of into the restful Face of Death. That
was when he, Bisrain, who knew, had
spoken of the noose; and at least it had
done the little Shelter of the World no
harm.
	Harm? echoed Sonnys mother
gently. You have never done him
harm, Bisra. Why, the doctor sahib him-
self said your hand was fortunate with
the child. If you had not been with him,
I think  I think, Bisram  he might
have died. And now I am even won-
dering if I am wise to let you go.
	Bisram looked up eagerly. I must
go, Huzoor. I must go without fail to-
night,  the year is over. He paused
abruptly, then added quietly, The Hu-
zoor need have no fear. The little mas-
ter will do well. The Mighty One, who
cares for children, will protect this one.
	He spoke with such faith in voice and
face that Sonnys mother, going back to
the study, and finding her husband busy
as usual over his Pantheon, lingered to
look doubtfully at the tale pictures, and
finally remarked that, after all, the peo-
ple really had a good deal of religious
feeling, and really seemed to believe in
a God. Bisram, for instance, bad said
that Sonny was in the guardianship of
One who suffered the little children 
Here her eyes filled with tears and her
voice sank.
	He meant Mata deai, I suppose, my
dear, replied the scholar without look-
ing up. She is another form of Kali or
Durga, and corresponds to Cybele or the
Mater Montana.
	He was very eager to get away,
however, went on Sonnys mother, al-
most aggrievedly. I really think he
might have stayed a few days longer,
till the boy was quite himself. But, de</PB>

voted as he is, he is just like the rest of
them,  selfishly set on what they are
accustomed to.
	He put off going nearly a month,
though, and you know, my dear, that
when he took service as Sonnys bearer
he stipulated for a fortnights leave every
spring about a certain time, in order to
perform some religious ceremonial,
protested justice.
	Well, and he has had it,  every
year for five years; so he might have
given it up for once. But he would nt
 I dont believe he would, not even to
save Sonnys life. However, I think the
child is all right; and even if I had kept
Bisram he would nt have been much
good, for he has been frightfully restless
and hurried the last few days.
	He did not seem so, however, as he
stood quietly in the growing dusk at the
gateless gate of the compound, to look
back at the house where he had left the
little Shelter of the World asleep. His
scarlet and yellow coat was gone, re-
placed by the faint coral-colored gar-
ment of the pilgrim; he carried a net-
work-covered pot for holy water slung
on his left wrist, and the yellow trident
of Siva showed like a frown on his fore-
head. The thickets of flowering shrubs,
the tangle of white petunias bordering
the path, sent their perfume into the air;
but above it rose the heavy dead-sweet
scent from the wild dhatura plant which,
taking advantage of an unweeded nook
by the gate, thrust its long white flow-
ers across the plaster; one of them in-
deed reaching past it, and so seen, fine
pointed against the dusk beyond, looking
like a slim white hand pointing the way
thither.
	Bisram stooped deliberately to pick
it, tore it into its five segments, and placed
the pieces in his bosom, muttering softly,
With heart, and brain, and feet, and
hands, and eyes, Deni, I am thy servant.
Then for a second he raised himself to
his full height, and stretched both his
thin, fine hands  such delicately sup-

ple, strong hands  toward the house.
Sleep sound, Life of my Life, he mur-
mured again. Sleep sound, and have
no fear. The offering will be complete,
though the time is short indeed.
	So, turning on his heel, he passed into
the dusk beyond the gate whither the
flower had pointed. A fortnight later
he canie out of it again, passed into his
hut in the gloaming dressed as a pilgrim,
and emerged therefrom, ten minutes af-
terward, in the red and yellow coat, with
a huge white turban with a bend, as the
heralds call it, across it bearing his mas-
ters crest. So attired he slipped back
into his place, as if he had never left it,
and setting aside the reed screen at the
door of Sonnys nursery stood within.
Sonny, in his white flannel dressing-gown,
was convalescent enough to be saying his
prayers kneeling on his mothers knee.
	Go on, dear, she said gently. You
can speak to Bisrarn afterwards.
	Sonny, whose feet were less wayward
now, shut his eyes again, and assumed a
prayerful eXl)ression.
	 an all kine friends, an make me
a velly good boy  yamen  Oh, Bis-
ram! where s the noose?
	The mother might smile, unable to
pretend ignorance. Not so Bisram bear-
er, who had his orders. What noose,
Shelter of the World?  he asked grave-
ly. The servant remembers none; but
he hath brought the Protector of the
Poor a toy.
	It was only one of the many which
you can buy in any Indian town for the
fraction of a farthing, made of mud,
straw, and cane. A bit of tinsel, per-
haps, or tuft of cotton, their sole value
over and above the ingenuity and time
spent in making them; but Sonny had
never seen this kind before, and laughed
as the snakes made out of curled shav-
ings leaped and twisted, leaped so like
life that his mother drew back hastily,
telling herself that the bearer had cer-
tainly a fine taste in horrors. And no
doubt there would be some tale to match</PB>

these. Sonny, however, seemed to know
it vaguely, for a puzzled look replaced the
laugh. Yes, Bisra, he said, in impe-
rious argument, Mai K~ili had snakes
and skulls too, but I like the noose best.
Why dicist thou not bring it back, son of
an owl ?
	The man never moved a muscle. The
little master mistakes, he replied calm-
ly. It was some other who tied the
noose; not this dust-like one. He is hut
the Protector of the Poors bearer Bis-
ram.

II.

	A year is an eternity to the memory
of a child. Indeed, before one twelfth
of one was over, Sonny had ceased from
suddenly asking irrelevantly, Oh, Bis-
ra, where is the noose? Why didst not
bring it back, son of an owl? The
thought seemed to have passed from his
life altogether. From Bisrams also, as
he tended the child night and day, day
and night, unremittingly, contentedly.
	So the spring of the year returned,
and with it, by one of those mysterious
coincidences beyond classification, came
the old desire. It came suddenly  ir-
relevantly it seemed to Sonnys parents
 during a brief attack of fever which
the changing season brought to the boy.
But Bisram bearer, hearing the little
fretful wail, Oh, Bisra, where is the
noose? I want the noose, stood silent
for a moment with a scared look in his
eyes, then turned them in quick appeal
to his mistress, as if to ask leave for
something. But she was silent, also, so
the old formula came gently, What
noose, Shelter of the World?
	That evening, however, when Harry
 as his mother vainly strove to call
him, now that, as she used to tell her
boy fondly, he was a man, and had had
his curls cut  had fallen into the heavy
sleep which brings so little relief, the
bearer came into the study and asked for
his usual yearly leave. A week might do,
but leave he must have at once. True,
the year was not up, but the master
would doubtless remember that his slave
had deferred going at the proper season
last time, because of Harry sahibs ill-
ness. (Bisram, punctilious to the least
order, never forgot the childs new dig-
nity.) He did not want to lose the right
season again, so if he went now at once,
even for a week, he would be ~back in
time, even if Harry sahib were to be
ill, as he was last year, which Heaven
forefend!
	He was quite calm, but there was an
almost pathetic entreaty in his dark eyes,
 so soft, so dark, that, looking into
theni, one seemed to see nothing save soft
darkness.
	Go! commented Sonnys mother,
when, moved by a vague feeling that
Bisram meant well, his master handed
on his request to the real authority.
Certainly not. I wonder he has the
face to ask for leave when Sonny  I
mean Harry  is down with fever. INot
that it is anything, the doctor says, but
a passing~ attack. Still, I am not going
to run any risks with a strange servant.
Go! Indeed, it shows what his pretend-
ed devotion is worth.
Surely, my dear, he is devoted 
Oh, very, in his way. But really
you spoil Bisra, Edward,  just because
he can tell you things about those hor-
rid gods and goddesses. Do you know,
I really think of getting an English
nurse for the child, until I have  until
I have to take him home, interrupted
his wife, her initial sharpness of tone
softening over the inevitable certainty
of separation which clouds Indian mo-
therhood. It cannot be right to let
him live in such an atmosphere of su-
perstition and ignorance.
	The magistrate, who was leaving the
room, had paused at her remark aboulj
the nurse, as he might have paused be-
fore a painful scene. By Jove! he
murmured, as if to himself, I believe it
would break the mans heart. I often</PB>

wonder what on earth he 11 do when
the child has  to go home.
	The inevitable lent a tremor to the
fathers voice, also. But Bisram, despite
the formers belief, spoke of the same
separation quite calmly, when, the very
next morning, the doctor, coming early,
found his little patient on the veranda
in Bisras arms getting the advantage
of the fresh, bright air; when he asked
calmly, but with that slow, pathetic anx-
iety in his eyes, was Harry sahib go-
ing across the black waters ?
	You think he ought to go, said the
doctor. Why?
	This slave does not think; he knows
the little master must go,  go at once,
replied the man, still calmly, though he
held the child to him with a visibly
closer strain.  The Huzoor himself
knows how bad Hindustan is for the lit-
tle ones. He must go, Huzoor, before
he gets worse.
	But he is not going to get worse, said
the doctor kindly. He is better already,
and if he has another bout of fever his
mother has promised to take him to the
hills; so dont distress yourself.
	Bisrams dark eyes looked unrestful-
ly into the doctors. The hills? That
would be worse. That would be nearer
the evil. He must go far from Hindus-
tan at once, Huzoor; and if you tell Lhe
mem this she will go,  she will not
mind.
	And you, Bisra? asked the doctor
curiously.
	The mans eyes flinched, but he never
stirred a muscle under the blow.
	I am only the little masters bearer,
Huzoor. He will not need one much
longer; he grows big.
	It is only because he is in a hurry to
get away himself, I verily believe, said
Sonnys mother, when the doctor, also
vaguely impressed with something in the
mans appeal, told her of it. You cant
fathom these people. Ah! I know he
would nt abate one atom of his care, and
it is simply wonderful. All the same, I
believe that just now lie would be glad
to be rid of the necessity for it, since it
clashes with some of his religious no-
tions. That s it, depend upon it. And
I mean to let him go, as soon as Sonny
 I mean Harry  is better; and he
really is better to-day, is nt he?
	Much better; and you may be right,
only it s always impossible to lay down
the law for men like Bisra. Those high-
caste hill Brahmins are a law unto them-
selves. However, I expect to find the
boy quite cool to-morrow.
	He was not, however, and more than
once, as he lay in Bisras arms, the little
fretful wail rose between sleeping and
waking. Where s the noose, Bisra?
I want the noose. And Bisra would
pause as if waiting for a promise of way-
ward life in threat or abuse, and when
neither came would turn a wistful appeal
to authority, and when it was silent say,
What noose, Shelter of the World?
	But in the dead of the night, a day or
two later, when even maternal authority
slept for a brief spell, Bisras answer to
the request which came almost incoher-
ently from the childs dry lips was differ-
ent. Then he stood bent over the boys
cot in the attitude of a suppliant, and his
joined petitioning hands trembled.
	Why dost ask it, KMi Ma? he
whispered rapidly. Lo! have I not
served thee? Would I not serve thee
now if I could? But I have promised
this, and they will not let me go for the
other. Lo! Kali Ma! be merciful, and
ask no more, and when the child has gone
away I will serve thee all the years, 
yea, every day of all the years.
	There was no passion, no excitement,
in his face or voice; only that pathetic
appeal which passed into a murmured
lullaby as the restless little sleeper turned
on his pillow with a sigh of greater con-
tent.
	Better again this morning, was the
doctors verdict, with the rider that Bis-
ram himself stood in need of a little rest.
The man smiled faintly when his mis-</PB>

tress replied that it would be her turn
that night, though, to say sooth, Harry
certainly did seem to improve when she
slept.
	Perhaps Bisram works charms, re-
marked the doctor thoughtlessly; whereat
she frowned.
	Charms or no charms, the boy was evi-
dently worse i~ext morning, and that de-
spite the fact that Bisram, who had stead-
ily refused to go further than the ve-
randa, had spent the night huddled up
outside the threshold, within which his
mistress refused to allow him to come.
He needed rest, she said, and though she
could not compel him to take it, he
should at least not work.
	You had better let him have his own
way to-night, said the doctor at his even-
ing visit. The child gets on better, and
you are fresher for the days nursing.
Those thin, delicate-looking natives are
very wiry, and if the man wont rest he
wont, and that s an end of it.
	He spoke cheerfully, but as he was get-
ting into his dogcart he saw Bisram at
his elbow. The doctor sahib thinks the
little master very ill to-night? he asked
quietly.
	So ill that you must do your very
best for him to-night. If any one can
pull him through, you can,  remember
that.
	Huzoor, said Bisram submissively.
	It was a dark night, so dark that the
rushlight in Sonnys room seemed almost
brilliant from the veranda. Looking
thence you could see the childs cot, one
of its side rails removed, and in its place
as it were the protection of Bisram s
crouching figure. He did not touch the
cot; he crouched beside it, with clasped
hands hanging over his knees and dark
eyes staring hard into the darkness, as
if waiting and listening.
	So he sat, his clasped hands loosen-
ing, his eyes growing softer, as the hours
passed, bringing nothing but half-con-
scious sleep, half-conscious wakening, to
the child; until suddenly, irrelevantly,
just on the borderland of night and day,
the fretful wail rose upon the silence
loudly, insistently.
	Where is the noose, Bisra? I want
it. Oh, Bisra bearer, bring the noose
and strangle something.
	The slackness, the dreaminess, left the
mans hands and eyes. He stood up
blindly, desperately, to face these last
words, the words for which he had been
listening. Yet there was still the same
pathetic self-control as he stretched his
hands and out over the sleeping child.
	Lo! K~iii Ma! heinuttered. Have
I not served thee as ever despite the
child? Have I set him before Thee?
Nay! thou knowest I have risked life it-
self to have Thy tale of offering complete
when I was hindered. Thou didst not
suffer. Wilt not wait for once? Wilt
not wait one little while ?
His voice sinking in its entreaty ended
in silence; but only for a second. Then
the fretful wail began again. The
noose, Bisra! Be not unkind; remember
I ani ill. Oh, Bisra, I want you to stran-
gle something for me  
Bisra gave a faint sob, then joined his
outstretched hands. Huzoor! so be it!
the noose shall find a victim. Yea, Shelter
of the World, Bisra will strangle some-
thing. Sleep in peace!
	There was no sound in the room after
that save the little contented sigh in
which restlessness finds rest.
	Outside the shiver of the cicalas
seemed to count the seconds, but inside
the darkness hours seemed to pass unno-
ticed as Bisra sat beside the cot, his
hands listless, his eyes dreamy. There
was nothing t~o wait for now, nothing to
fear. That which had to come had come.
	So with the first glint of light a
stealthy step glided in and an anxious
voice whispered, How is it with the
child, Bisra?
	It is well, lie whispered back, rising
rather stiffly. He hath slept since the
darkest hour. He will sleep on. The
mother, peering carefully for a glimpse</PB>

of the childs face, smiled at what she
saw.
	He sleeps indeed. Thou hast done
well, Bisra. He made no answer. But
ere he left the room, his night-watch be-
ing over, he paused to touch the foot-rail
of the cot with both hands and so salaam
as those do who leave the presence.
	Sonny was still sleeping when his fa-
ther, entering his study with a lighter
heart, found a stranger, as he thought,
awaiting him there. It was a man naked
save for a waisteloth, lean, sinewy, lithe;
the head was clean-shaven save for the
Brahminical tuft, and the face was dis-
figured by the weird caste marks of ex-
treme fanaticism.
	Who   he began, shrinking in-
voluntarily from one who might well be
dangerous.
	It is Bisra, Huzoor, said the fa-
miliar voice gently. Bisra the childs
bearer, Bisra the servant of Kali also.
Lo! here is her noose. As he spoke he
held out the crimson - scarlet handker-
chief twisted to a rope and coiled in his
curved palms like a snake. The mas-
ter, being learned, will know the noose
and its meaning. It hath brought Her
many a blood offering, Huzoor,  many
and many every year without fail, and
it will not fail this year, either. It will
bring Her the blood of Her servant, the
blood of Bisram the Strangler.
	Bisram the Strangler? echoed the
magistrate stupidly, as the even, mono-
tonous voice ceased. Then he sat down
helplessly in his chair. In truth he knew
too much of the mystery of India to be
quite incredulous.
	Yet two hours after, when with the
help of the police officer he had been
cross-questioning Bisra upon his confes-
sion, he told himself as helplessly that it
was incredible,  the man must be mad.
He had been born to strangle, he said, and
had strangled to keep Kali Ma content.
That was necessary when you were born
Her servant, especially when you had
children. Perhaps he had let the little
Shelter of the World creep too close to
his heart, though he had striven to be
just. At any rate, K~li Ma had become
jealous. He had not known this at first,
or he would never have given the mis-
tress that promise about the noose; for if
it had been in Harry sahibs hands Dovi
Would never have sought his life. She
always protected those with th~ noose 
they never came to harm  unless 
He had paused there, and then asked
quickly if he had not said enough. Did
they want him to tell any more? He
could not give them the names of the
victims, of course, not knowing them, but
they were many, very many.
	There is nothing against him but his
own story, said the magistrate, fighting
against his growing conviction that the
man spoke truth. I cant commit him
to the sessions on that.
	There is something more, I think,
replied the police officer reluctantly.
Dont you remember that man who was
found dead in a railway carriage, about
this time last year? He had an up-
country ticket on him, and as this was
out qf the beat of Stranglers no inquiry
was made here. It was just about this
time, and  and Bisram says be was in
a hurry because the year was nearly up.
He had been nursing the boy.
	The boys father, leaning with his
head on his hands, groaned.
	But Bisra was quite cheerful. He
looked a little anxious, however, when two
days after he was brought up formally
to be committed for trial. There was
still nothing definite against him save
his own confession and the coincidence
of the strangled man in the railway car-
riage. But opinion was dead against
him amongst his countrymen. Of course
he was one of Kalis Stranglers. Did
he not look one? Was he not now one?
So bow could he help being one? The
argument brought no consolation to Son-
nys father. But Bisram again was
charged. He stood patiently between
two yellow-legged policemen and told</PB>

his tale at length, as if anxious to incrim-
inate himself as much as possible, anx-
ions that there should be no mistake.
Aiid when all the mysterious intricacies
of charges and papers were over, and the
two policemen nudged him to make
place for other criminals with a friendly
Come along, brother, he paused a mo-
ment with handcuffed, petitioning hands
to ask how soon he was to be hanged.
	The magistrate made no answer; he
knew what the question meant, and could
not. The thought of his little son came
between him and the truth; namely, that
Bisras sacrifice must await the laws
pleasure.
	The doctor in charge of the jail where
Bisra awaited trial had not the heart to
tell the truth. Every day when on his
rounds he looked into the cell, like a
wild beasts cage, where Bisra, being a
Strangler and therefore dangerous to
life, was confined alone, he answered the
question which the tall naked figure
stood up at his entrance to ask in the
same words. Harry sahib was better;
and as for the hanging, that would come
soon enough, never fear. Yet every day
the pathetic self-controlled eagerness on
the mans face struck him with a sense
of physical pain, and left him helpless be-
fore his own pity.
	Until a day came  after not many
days  when, with a face red from the
sight of bitter grief that he could un
derstand, the sense of his absolute help-
lessness before the mystery of this mans
nature made the doctor feel inclined to
throw pity to the winds and fall back on
sheer common sense. After all, the man
was a murderer; and if he had been
fond of the child, what then? Such
criminals were often men of strong affec-
tions.
	Yet once again the sight of the sub-
missive salnaming figure, the sound of
the wistful yet calm voice, made his an-
swer as usual. The child was better.
The hanging would doubtless come ere-
long.
	For once, however, Bisram did not ac-
cept the reply as final.
	The Huzoor means that it will not
come to-day? he asked quietly.
	The doctor raised his eyebrows. To-
day? What made you think of to-day?
Certainly not. There s no chance of it.
	But he was wrong. Two hours after-
ward the jail overseer sent for him in
a hurry, because Bisram had completed
his sacrifice by strangling himself in his
cell with his waisteloth. What else could
he do, seeing that it was the last day of
the year during which the propitiation
of a sacrifice kept KMi Ma from re-
venge?
	Poor devil! said the doctor as he
stood up after his examination. I m
glad now I did nt tell him the child was
dead.

the comfort she meant to give stole into
his heart as he remembered them. At
least, he could be glad for the past, 
glad beyond all that she had nothing to
regret.</PB>

	Thank God, she never dreamed how
his jealousy of her success had once
nearly ruined their lives. The blood
burned hot in his cheeks as the memory
of that wretched time came back to him.
How could he have been so contempti-
bly weak? The thought carried him
from the desolate horrors of the present
back to the beginning of their married
life. Slowly their years together passed
before his inner sight.
	The picture of their first two years
was full of the light of perfect happi-
ness. No two, he felt, had ever been
more truly wedded. It was then, too,
that her paintings gained their first de-
cided recognition. Though the same
years brought him nothing but failure,
he had felt only pride and delight in
her success. He would have lingered
tenderly over this part of their life, but
something hurried him on to the next
year. He dropped his illustrative work
entirely that year, and devoted all his
time to painting. It was a wise change,
too, he had felt, for by spring his work
clearly showed a great gain in strength
and charm. Secretly, he had almost
agreed with Margaret that one of his
pictures must take the Society prize. But
it was the same old story. At the end
of the season they all came back to him,
unsold, unprized. But all of Margarets
pictures had sold, and one received hon-
orable mention. And he had realized
that the next years expenses must be
paid by her.
	The memory of that hour swept over
him with a horrible vividness. The
only comfort that caine to him now was
the knowledge that he had kept his feel-
ings from her. She never knew why
he was so glad just then to make a visit
to their old uncle. In the quiet of the
country he struggled with himself till
he was able to come back, sane. The
following months were crowded with
work and happiness. He was sure she
had never remembered that she was the
breadwinner that year. Those days were
full of light and rosy color; but his
thoughts soon drew him away from
them to the next spring.
	All his pictures that season had been
well received and fairly well hung;
not nearly so well, however, as Marga-
rets. It seemed as if hanging commit-
tees, for once, had suddenly developed
unexpected discrimination. They gave
her steadily lighted places, neither too
high nor too low, her perspectives taken
into account in a most miraculous way.
And Margaret had sold; more than all,
Margaret had taken a first prize, and
once again a third prize.
	Here his mental picture became grim
and distorted. Could he ever forget
how, for one dreadful hour, he had for-
gotten to make jubilee with her?
	He had been awarded no prize, and
not one of his glowing canvases had
been sold. Then, bitter chagrin and a
terrible doubt of his own ability so
racked him that he grew afraid to let
her see his face. With a fishing-trip
for excuse, he had again left her till he
could regain his self-command. Three
days later, he was so sore and smarting
that even now he did not care to specu-
late upon what might have been the end.
It was in the midst of his despair that
a blessed letter came. In it the trus-
tees of a well-known art museum offered
him a thousand dollars for his picture
exhibited that year.
	When he took Margaret into his
arms again, she did not suspect that his
first thought was one of thankfulness for
an escape from possible shipwreck. She
was only wildly happy over his success.
	You re known now! she cried glee-
fully. You wont have stupid men and
stupider pictures climbing over you any
more. You ye begnn to win, and you 11
keep right on.
	What a glorious year that next was!
 a year of noble work flooded with the
sunshine of happy love. Sitting before
her desk, where she would sit no more,
he felt more deeply than ever all the</PB>

joy of those months. What a busy pair,
too, they had been! And when spring
came, how well their pictures appeared!
What did she say about his Easter
Morning just before it was boxed? He
seemed to hear the very tones of the
dear voice.
	Rob, I think you have found your
forte. But it is nt in such dream-sub-
jects as this. It s down there in the
left-hand corner. If you cant paint
better sheep and cows and brooks and
skies than any man we have, I 11 sell
my Mother and Child for a dollar.
Rob, you re an animal-landscapist, and
we never knew it before!
	Then she danced a Highland fling be-
fore him, till he caught her in his arms,
and promised~ to please her, that his next
composition should have nothing in it but
sheep and cows and brooks and skies.
	Once more his big frames started on
their wandering way, with her little ones
beside them. He remembered he had
hoped much that time, and when the
season s last exhibit was nearly over,
with all his pictures still unsold, the old
wretched thoughts again pressed upon
him. It had taken more effort than he
cared to remember to show Margaret
only joy at her successes; but she had
not seen his trouble, he was certain; and
the very last day of the last exhibit, his
big Easter Morning was bought by their
own art museum.
	After that he began his animal-
scrapes, as Margaret called them; and
she was right, as she always was. He
had taken prizes and sold, till now every
canvas he sent out was sure to find a
purchaser. At last he had been able to
do all for her that he had longed to do.
Best of all, she had never suspected his
sore bitterness before his success came.
Thank God, she could say truly, Ten
beautiful years. Forever these words
would comfort and console him. That
he had been true to his trust, that he had
not even in his despair tortured her, was
exceeding sweet to him now.
	Yes, he was glad, unspeakably glad,
he said to himself, as he once more be-
gan to look over her letters and papers.
Yet, just for a minute, he felt himself
insanely longing that she might have
guessed his trouble.
	For the next hour he tried to forget
everything but the papers that he must
arrange. Her scrappy memoranda, has-
ty marginal notes on bills and receipts,
her curious collection of useless odds
and ends, kept choking him and send-
ing sharp stings into his heart; but he
worked on, till all was in order except
the last drawer. That held a fat lea-
ther book which he saw was a sort of
journal. One day she made only brief
jottings of subjects for pictures; the
next she told in comical sentences of a
row with a grocer. Further on she
went into a little rhapsody over a beau-
tiful day in the country that they had
taken together. One night she wrote of
a religious discussion with a certain min-
ister who was troubled about her soul.
Robert laughed and almost cried at the
way she tripped the worthy parson, and
then contritely showed him how far she
really was from the heretic he thought
her. Once she described a mans face,
 a face that, though idealized beyond
his belief, he did not need her conclud-
ing words, the man I love, to know
was his own. A little further on came
the following entries 
JIlay 20. Robs pictures have come
back, unsold. What are people think-
ing of? And why did that stupid jury
give me an honorable mention, and ig-
nore him? This is the third year that
he has nt sold a canvas. It breaks
my heart. I know he will succeed soon-
er or later, but it is nt the easiest thing
for one who seems to be making only
failures to keep his own courage up. If
only he had the little money I have!
Or else, if he could sell instead of me!
	JIlay 21. Rob is going to uncle
Bens for a few days rest. I know what
is the real matter. He s discouraged;</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00831" SEQ="0831" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="825">	Ten Beautiful Years.	825

and he s thinking of the remarks that
certain of our relatives will make about
his failures. They never shall have the
chance to make them. I 11 get a new
gown to-morrow, and tell them that
Robs last picture bought it. I wish I
could comfort him.
	June 1. Rob is back, and all right
again, thank Heaven, and he s the brav-
est man I know. He has gone to work
without any fuss, and is as cheery as a
bobolink. If I could only make him
understand how big and splendid and
fine he is to me, I dont believe he d
worry about art committees or stupid
people who dont know good pictures.
So she had guessed! The little book
dropped from his hand. And she had
no reproaches for him; she even thought
him brave and splendid. Somehow this
knowledge comforted him unspeakably,
and he turned to the next pages with a
warm glow. There was very little writ-
ten for nearly a year; then, under date
of March 20, he read: 
All the canvases are out of the
house. Robs Earth and Heaven is stun-
ning. But it is nt the kind of picture
that appeals to the public, nor, I m
afraid, to prize committees either. I
wonder if it is a part of nineteenth-cen-
tury decadence,  this fashion in art?
Where do we end, when painters them-
selves fail to appreciate good work un-
less when it is their kind ?
	If Rob should nt get any recogni-
tion this year, I dont know what I shall
do. He must! No one can go on for-
ever without encouragement. If he only
could once get a prize or be bought by
a prominent somebody, he d be all right.
The herd always follows a leader.
	April 5. We are all hung. Robs
Earth and Heaven is nt in a very good
light, while my Moonshine is fairly foist-
ed into conspicuous notice by the extraor-
dinary care in placing. Why I should
be so favored, and the real genius of
Rob so little appreciated, I cant com-
prehend. I only wish I could be hang-
ing committee and prize committee and
general public, all in one, for just one
day!
	April 30. Two of my daubs have
sold, and one has taken a prize. It
breaks my heart; I wish I had nt sent
any at all. There is one more chance
for Rob. If be is nt mentioned then, I
shall want to go away and hide. And
he is as brave as ever. Would nt I
rave if I were he! It is so abominably
unfair.
	May 25. Everything is over. Rob
did nt sell, did nt get a prize, did nt
get anything. I never shall forget his
face when he first knew it. If I could
only have comforted him! But I am
sure he would rather have me never sus-
pect his soreness. He is going off fish-
ing for a day or two. Fishing! My
brave boy! He thinks he will get over
the hurt before he comes back to me.
What s a wife good for if she cant help
at such times as this? But I seem so
powerless.
	May 30. Its done! Im glad
now that Rob insisted I should keep en-
tire control of the little money I have.
It was easy, once thought of, to sell a
bond, and have the broker himself send
the amount to the museum with the un-
derstanding that it should buy Robs
picture. No one except that unimpor-
tant broker knows a thing about it. As
for giving up the bond, it does nt make
any difference. I 11 scrimp in house-
keeping. Besides, once Rob is recog-
nized so publicly, he 11 be gaining shek-
els for himself.
	Once more the book slipped from the
mans hands, and his head dropped into
them, while big sobs shook his whole
body.	N
	My wife! he whispered broken-
ly,  my wife ! 
	After a while, with the tears still on
his cheeks, he again opened the little
volume at a date a year later.
	May 25. Only one more day, and
Rob has won nothing, while I, wretched</PB>

catelipenny, have sold and got prizes in
abundance. How could they praise my
trash, and slight such work as Robs?
He shall not be so disappointed. I 11
sell another bond and present it to the
museum. The broker can manage it
for me, and nobody will ever know. I
only wish I dared take more of the
money. But there is so little, and house-
keeping does cost so much. If our re-
spected relatives knew how we do man-
age, they would have a high opinion of
our domestic economy. This thousand
dollars must be spent for a better studio
for Rob. He will need the room if he
goes in for animals. Guess we 11 build
a double one right behind the house.
	A year after this came the following:
	June 15. Hurrah! Hurrah! Robs
triumph has come! He got prizes, and
has sold everything and has orders ahead.
Is nt that glorious! I always knew he
would finally win, but the waiting seemed
so long.
	I ye been almost wishing I might
tell him about the last two years. But
he is a man, and I m afraid it might
hurt his pride, even if he has at last
succeeded. I never realized till those
years of apparent failure how strong he
is, or how I  worship him! And I
felt so ashamed of the stupid people who
praised me instead of him that I could
n t bear to take their money. I had no
business with it. Besides, I knew if he
once got his name before the public the
rest would follow. I m so happy and
thankful! I should like to tell him all
about it, and how I love  love him 
love him.

	The fire burned low in the grate; the
shadows crept out of the corners, and
slipped across the floor, and huddled
about the man who sat, with bowed head,
clasping the little book. Out of the still-
ness came the message that would abide
with him so long as he must live:
There s nothing to regret. We have
had ten beautiful years.

M. EDMOND ROSTAND.

	THE world is seeking a poet. There
was a time the poet came uncalled, but
that is past. Now men search diligent-
ly lest the light be hid forever beneath
its bushel, and leave the earth in dark-
ness. Slender volumes of verse, tenta-
tively put forth by publishers, are zeal-
ously examined. To stand sponsor to
a poet is the secret hope of the reviewer.
Academies offer prizes for poetry with
signs of permanence. The laurel wreath
is plaited and trimmed. The feast of
welcome is spread. Out in the high-
ways and hedges the critics search to
find a poet, and compel him to come in.
	The wisdom of this course is a vexed
question. Should a poet, to borrow a
phrase of Burkes, be coaxed and dan-
dled into eminence, or do the winds of
adversity provoke a sturdier growth?
There is little use in citing witnesses.

poetic dramatist, the pastoral poet, the
writer of sonnets, the singer of songs, are
all members one of another. Homer,
Horace, Victor Hugo, Heine, Tennyson,
are the common heritage of all who
love them. It is the same with lesser
men who have delighted generations.
And now we are glad that another name
may worthily be added to the list of po-
ets,  the name of the young French
dramatist, M. Edmond Rostand.
	The success of a young man carries
with it an exhilarating sense of possi-
bility that can never come from the
work of a veteran. M. Rostand has not
yet passed his thirtieth year. The full-
ness of his power lies, we hope, in the
future, although it is hard to believe
that he can outdo the merit of his last
achievement.
	M.	Rostand was born at Marseilles
in the autumn of 1868. The passion of
his boyhood was for the stage. Plays
and acting soon became his favorite
study. Given romance, ambition, po-
etry, and a boy, and who shall tell the
reams of paper used ? His proficiency
in verse increased amazingly, and at
eighteen he was the author of a metri-
cal comedy  in manuscript. For some
time the play was laid away. We be-
lieve it must have been revised, but,
however this may be, the author plucked
up courage, dispatched his work to the
Com6die Fran9aise, and waited for an
answer. Like editors, the managers of
theatres are but poor correspondents.
If we may trust report, the reply was
postmarked one year later. Even then
the managers were not to be hurried to
a rash conclusion. They required the
author to appear before them. He
obeyed, and read his work in the pre-
sence of his assembled judges. The in-
genuity, the drollery, the nimble verse
of Les Romanesques delighted the au-
dience. The play was accepted and
promptly filed. The author returned
to the provinces. Soon afterward he
joined a theatrical company, and ap
peared before the footlights in a drama
called Le Gant Rouge. It was not,
however, until the 2lst of May, 1894,
that, together with two other brief pieces,
both the work of young playwrights,
Les Romanesques was actually performed
upon the stage.
	The plot of this three-act play is an
inversion of a traditional farce. Two
fathers, in reality the nearest of friends,
wish their children to marry each other.
But the youth and maiden, living in
dreams of romance, would never hear
of a smooth road to love. Wise parents
know their children. The fathers feign
the hate of Capulets and Montagues,
and to their delight the enraptured chil-
dren play Romeo and Juliet in earnest.
And so the theme runs on through a
succession of absurd misadventures te a
happy ending.
	It is all mere farce. In the love
scenes the verse is heightened to play-
ful burlesque. At times the humor
broadens, and we fear buffoonery. But
buffoonery never really comes, and all
the while we laugh as at the high spirits
of a child. We cannot criticise the
work seriously; we do not care to. We
think of the author as some charming
boy who has within him the traditions
of a noble school. His verses show the
elegance of his breeding. We need have
little fear for his future. Let him frolic
as he will.
	In his second piece, played at the
Th6~tre de la Renaissance the follow-
ing year, M. Rostand has grown older.
La Princesse Lointaine is romance in
very truth. Jeifroy Rudel, prince and
troubadour, sails eastward in search of
the princess of his waking dreams.
When the boat reaches Tripoli, the crew
are fainting from starvation, and the
minstrel himself is very close to death.
Calling his brother-in-arms, Bertrand, he
bids him land and implore the princess
to come to the ship that he may behold
her once before he dies. Bertrand plights
his word. He goes ashore, and finds</PB>

Messalinde beautiful beyond dreams, and
surrounded by the splendor of the East.
The messenger pleads his cause too well.
Struck by his grace, his bearing, and the
passion of his words, the princess de-
termines to make him hers. Gradually
she seduces him from his loyalty. Her
own love swells with her success. She
exclaims to her maid: 
Quon doit laimer celni que lon rendit in-
fame
Et	qail faut consoler de ce quil fit pour
bus.,,

Bertrand struggles in vain against the
gilded meshes of her net. He yields,
and renounces honor, loyalty, every-
thing, for her.
	Suddenly black sails, the token of
death, are seen in the harbor. The
horror of their crime comes over the
lovers. The signal is a mistake, but
their awakening has come. In an agony
of repentance, they hasten to the galley.
The nobleness of Jeifroy Rudel, as he
lies dying, strikes to the soul of Messa-
linde. The minstrel dies in her arms,
and thenceforth she consecrates her life
to God.
	The play is pitched upon a note of
deep intensity, and supports it well. The
author attempts to relieve the stress by
the introduction of a semi-comic villain,
Squarciarfico, who serves the turn with
indifferent success. A better expedient
is the grace of the lighter verse, while a
charming little love song adds a touch
of archness that is all too slight. In the
love scenes, the verse is rich and pas-
sionate, though unequal. Like a born
playwright, the author shapes his situa-
tions to fine powers of acting. Indeed,
one feels instinctively that the key of
the play is in its dedication ~ Madame
Sarah Bernhardt; for as if to suit the
part the great actress loves best to play,
the character of Messalinde finds its
prototype in the Serpent of Old Nile.
	La Princesse Lointaine is a remark-
able literary accomplishment. Its roman-
tic passion and dramatic power deserve
high praise, yet we cannot but regret
that the authors gayety and sprightly
humor find no outlet here. We recog-
nize his ripening power, but we would
not have him lose his earlier charm.
We would counsel him: 
Enjoy your dear wit and gay rhetoric
That	hath so well been taught her dazzling
fence.

	It is a custom of the Parisian stage
to produce each year, during Passion
Week, plays based upon some religious
topic. And so it seemed little out of
the common, when the bill for Holy
Wednesday night in 1897, at the Th&#38; 
~tre de la Renaissance, was announced
as La Samaritaine, Evangile en vers par
M. Rostand.
	In substance, the play is an elaborate
paraphrase of the pathetic story in the
fourth chapter of St. John. After the
conversation at the well, the woman of
Samaria, mocked and despised by the
people of her city, confesses her sins be-
fore them, and describes with passionate
adoration the Saviour sitting at their
gates. The crowd listens with incredu-
lity; then, suddenly taking fire at her
words, streams from out the city. Je-
sus talks with them, sometimes accord-
ing to the Gospel of St. John, sometimes
according to that of M. Rostand; and
when the emotional fervor has reached
its height the play ends in prayer.
	It is hard for an Anglo-Saxon to at-
tempt an impartial judgment of the liter-
ary worth of this astonishing perform-
ance, so opposed is it to every ingrained
principle and prejudice of our inherit-
ance. The Passion Play at Oberam-
mergau is a religious rite. This is an
emotional pastime. The simplicity of
the Gospels remains in our minds as the
noblest type of dignity. It has even
been hard for many of us to accept the
New Version of the Testament, and now
this Frenchman mutilates, amplifies, al-
ters at will, to suit the nice requirements
of his verse, and gain the plaudits of a
holiday crowd. The words of Jesus, so</PB>

familiar in their English rendering, are
in our ears: But whosoever drinketh
of the water that I shall give him shall
never thirst; but the water that I shall
give him shall be in huin a well of wa-
ter springing up into everlasting life.
And then we read: 
Quiconque
Boira leau de ce puits aura soif de nouveau;
Mais ii naura plus soif, celni qui boira lean
Q ue je lui donnerai; car en mi naitra delle
Le bondissement frais dune eau perp~tuelle,
De sorte quil sera sans fin d&#38; alt~r6
Celni qui boira leau que je mi donnerai.

	The dilution sounds weak and mawk-
ish. If worse were wanting, we might
find it in the parable of the Good Sa-
maritan in verse of complicated metre.
Nor is this all. Ill satisfied with the
words which sixty generations of men
have learned as the perfect expression
of a simple faith, this metrical evangel-
ist turns the Lords Prayer into rhyme,
and uses it for a stage climax.
	But it would be folly to deny that
there is merit in the play. There is
skill and there is poetry. Take, for in-
stance, these verses in which Photine
(such it seems is the name of the woman
at the well) speaks of her jar of water:
Tu	vois cette ean, cette ean limpide, si urn-
pide
Que	lorsquil ~ est plein, le vase semble
vide;
Si fraiche que lon voit en larmes de ineur,
En perles de clart4 ruisseler la sneur,
La sneur de fraicheur que lamphore pansue
Par tons les pores fins de son argue sue!

One must seek far for a description
more delicate than this.
	It is a fair generalization to say that
whenever M. Rostand is able to shake
off the shackles of his paraphrase his
verse gains in strength and dignity.
Sometimes, however, he ventures upon
sentiment dangerously at variance with
our conception of the Gospel. As Pho-
tine first comes upon the stage she sings
some lovers verses, which, were not
their original familiar to us in the Song
of Songs, we should think charming. A
little later, when, marveling at the gra
cious words of Christ, she seeks to give
voice to her love and adoration, she
breaks forth involuntarily in the same
strain,  a strain that had been but too
often addressed to earthy lovers. In a
moment she checks herself, with a sense
of sacrilege; but Jesus comforts her,
saying : 
Je suis tonjours un pen dans tons les mots
damour.

Surely we Anglo-Saxons may rejoice
that a wise Providence withheld from
the French the original writing of the
four Gospels!
	It was not until last winter that M.
Rostands reputation crossed the Chan-
nel, upon the burst of applause that
followed the production of Cyrano de
Bergerac. Here for the first time the
playwrights talents found their proper
measure. His wit, his mastery of verse,
his spirit, his young enthusiasm corn-
bined in a romantic masterpiece. Not
since She Stoops to Conquer and A
School for Scandal has so brilliant a
play been written for the stage. Suc-
cess was immediate and overwhelming.
Critic and audience were swept away in
a torrent of delighted approbation. Even
M. Jules Le Maitre, striving hard to
maintain his judicial composure, ex-
claimed that his thirteen years of critical
experience had never witnessed any such
performance; while M. Emile Faguet
and an army of connoisseurs fairly shout-
ed themselves hoarse in a tumult of un-
reasoning admiration.
	The story of the play is well known.
Cyrano de Bergerac, prince among wits,
king among his comrades, poet, gascon,
and swashbuckler, blessed with a thou-
sand graces, but penniless and cursed
with a fatal nose, adores his cousin,
Roxane. She, umisuspicious of his secret,
likes his companionship, but her own af-
fections lean toward Christian, a soldier
with a generous heart, a dull wit, and a
pretty face. As for Christian, he wor-
ships Roxane, but, distrusting his own
eloquence, he dares not plead his cause.</PB>

With romantic unselfishness, Cyrano
teaches him the nice art of gallantry, and
even writes for him his love letters, pour-
ing into them all his own passion. Rox-
ane is touched by the fascinating impor-
tunity of the lover. While she leans one
night from her balcony, Christian wooes
her with words whispered in his ear by
Cyrano under cover of the darkness.
She is conquered, and Cyrano raises his
rival to receive the kiss that he himself
has won.
	But the chivalrous hero does not pause
till the victory is complete. By his con-
trivance the lovers are married. Then
Christian and Cyrano are compelled to
depart for the wars, and the next act
opens upon the siege of Arras. Roxane 5
love for her husband has been fanned
by every letter Cyrano has written in
his name. Fearful of his safety she
comes to the camp. She tells him that
hers is no common love: she loves him
for his soul; she would deem it an insult
were her passion for his beauty alone.
Poor simple-hearted Christian is over-
whelmed. He seeks out Cyrano, and
tells him that all dissimulation must
cease. Roxane must choose between
them. Cyrano feels that it is he who
is loved beneath the mask of another;
but his constancy does not falter. He
implores Christian, for the sake of her
whom they both adore, to keep the se-
cret, and hastens to Roxane. All that
he has heard is true. Her love is more
than skin-deep. Were her husband ugly,
hideous,  nay, were he disfigured, 
she swears that she should love him still.
Nothing could make him grotesque in
her sight. Cyrano scarcely trusts him-
self to speak. Just then a comrade whis-
pers something in his ear. Christian has
been mortally wounded by the enemy.
His friends hurry to his side, and as he
lies dying in his mistresss arms Cyrano
whispers a noble falsehood in his ear : 
Jai tout dit. Cest toi quelle aime encore.

	The last act takes place fifteen years
later. Roxane, who ever since the tra
gedy has been living in retiroment, is
cheered every Saturday by a visit from
Cyrano, who tells her of the doings of
the great world of Paris. One day he
is wounded by a billet of wood hurled
at his head by a skulking valet. Un-
willing to renounce his audience, he
goes to see Roxane without telling of
his hurt. They talk of old times, and
she shows Cyrano her last letter from
Christian, which through all these years
she has worn near her heart. As Cy-
rano reads aloud the familiar words,
the daylight fades. Unconsciously he
goes on. Roxane watches him in amaze-
ment. All at once she understands.
But Cyranos wound is mortal. I
have loved but a single being, and I
have lost him twice! she exclaims.
And presently he dies.
	Upon Paris, crammed to repletion with
plays of an outworn and degenerate type,
Cyrano de Bergerac came with a quick-
ewing spirit. The school of the classics
had long been neglected. The reign of
Dumas ills had scarcely been challenged.
The problems of conscience which he
loved dearly to exploit under most un-
toward circumstances were favorite texts
for polite conversation. Le Demi-
Monde and Monsieur Alphonse afforded
ample opportunity for debate. Denise
went further, and united the two absorb-
ing questions: Should a young woman
who has sinned confess her fault to an
honest man who has asked her hand in
marriage? Should a man who has be-
trayed a woman tell the truth to his best
friend, if he wishes to marry her, but is
suspicious of her past? In the name
all that is reasonable, here were subtleties
enough to enliven a dozen soir6es. But
other decadent types were not wanting.
The m~nage ~ trois had been acted in
all its variations from light comedy to
suicide and murder. Social problems,
treated in their most brutal forms in Les
Mauvais Bergers and a host of lesser
pieces, had played upon the passions of
the people. The question of womans</PB>

position in every rank of society had
been a favorite theme to juggle with.
Only recently, the crowd had applauded
as a masterpiece a play which discusses
in its nakedness the problem which con-
fronts the wife of a debauchee, and sug-
gests as a solution that marriage vows
once broken by the husband are no long-
er binding upon the wife. After all this,
the noble touch of idealism that makes
Cyrano de Bergerac the play it is was
hailed with intense relief. It was the
same relief that in a petty scale comes
to the reader of some sparkling romance
after he has toiled through shelves of
bald and arid realism. People love ex-
tremes, and M. Rostand came in the
nick of time.
	Yet all this detracts not one whit
from the merits of the play. M. Ros-
tands venture commanded success, but
it deserved it. At the moment, Pari-
sians thought the play a creation of a
new type. In reality it is the lineal de-
scendant of the best traditions of French
literature. The author has schooled him-
self in his Moli~re, his Corneille, his
Hugo, and he knows them as well as ever
Stevenson did his Scott or Keats his
Shakespeare. Read Cyrano de Bergerac
carefully, and you will find reverence
for the masters at every turn. The note
of high romance, which Corneille caught
from iRonsard and from the literature
of Spain, is struck again by M. Rostand.
In Cyranos disdain for the world there
is something that reminds us of Le iMlis-
anthrope himself. Perhaps it is not fan-
ciful to imagine that, in part at least,
our hero inherits his adventurous spirit
and merry humor straight from Le
Sages Knight of Santillane. Certain it
is that the blood of Ruy Blas flows in
his veins, and who would deny his kin-
ship to the Three Musketeers and dAr-
tagnan to boot? But M. Rostand has
been the master, not the servant, of tra-
dition. In the best sense his play is
original, for it is instinct with his own
genius.
	The keynote of the plot is the heros
self-sacrifice. His unselfishness is com-
plete, but it is not without compensation.
In the intensity of his pain, he is con-
scious of a subtle delight in knowing
that he himself is loved in the person of
Christian. This is far from pure altru-
ism. It is more sensuous, more com-
plex, more human, more interesting.
	Yet were it not for Cyrano himself,
we should care little for his ideals. Bar
but his nose, and he fits snugly in the
choicest niche left vacant in our fancy.
Again, he is just as once he was when
all Paris was his stage. In a pleasant
volume that has long lain undusted on li-
brary shelves, Gautier recalls the Cyrano
of history, and numbers him among Les
Grotesques, the odd fish of literature.
	Born in the province of P~rigord in
1620, Cyrano early grew impatient of a
quiet home and a parochial school. At
eighteen he hurried to Paris, and speedi-
ly became the gayest and most brilliant
of a gay and brilliant throng. His caus-
tic wit made a new jest at every enemy,
and a new enemy at every jest. Soon,
too, all good Churchmen swelled the
number of his foes; when he wrote the
tragedy of Agrippine, he was promptly
accused of atheism, because, as was point-
edly remarked, neither Agrippine nor
Sejanus played a truly Christian part.
Indeed, it could not be denied that Se-
janus spoke like a downright heathen
when he said 
These gods whom men have made, and who
have not made men.
The scandal was patent, and the author
was duly held responsible. His rapier,
however, proved a ready defense, and
beyond a duel or two a day he ran lit-
tle danger. But the hero was not in-
vulnerable. His nose was a tender spot.
The vaguest reference to this inimitable
feature threw him into a paroxysm of
rage. If a stranger stared, it was an
insult; if he pointed, it was a signal for
instant execution.
At the siege of Arras, in 1640, Cy</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00838" SEQ="0838" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="832">	832	ilL Edmond Rostand.

ranos prodigies might have put Frois-
sarts heroes to the blush. When a
hundred enemies hurl an insult at his
friend, he charges them single-handed:
kills two, wounds a score, and chases the
remnant breathless from the field. But
valor without a patron is worth little.
Cyranos services went unrewarded, and
soon he left the service in disgust.
	Again at Paris, he turned his attention
to literature. His Voyage ~v la Lune
was famous in its day, and his P6dant
Jou6 contained a brilliant scene worthy
of a place among the master strokes of
comedy. It was laid aboard a pirates
galley, and iNIoli~re, then just rising into
fame, felt little compunction in preying
upon it, stealing the dialogue almost ver-
batim, and adorning the Fourberies de
Scapin with the borrowed refrain : 
Que diable allait-il faire dans cette gaThre.

	As an inventor, too, Cyrano was born
to make his mark, and the principle of
the balloon can clearly be traced to his in-
genious mind. But wit, skill, and cour-
age served the poor fellow ill. His re-
putation was stolen, his money left him,
and in 1655 he died miserably at the
hand of an assassin. As he lay on his
death-bed, like many a worse sinner, he
renounced forever the glittering folly of
the world. His soul would rest in heaven,
were it not reincarnate in M. Coquelin
to-day.
	M. Rostands hero is the very Cyrano
of real life, though his brilliancy is now
beyond poor human limits. The scenes
about him lend him fitting scope. A
dozen butts stand ready for his ridicule,
and every shaft he wings strikes home.
An unpresented viscount, angered at his
bearing, stalks up to him.
	Rascal, knave, jackass, idiot! he
exclaims.
	With perfect gravity Cyrano removes
his cap, and, as though his lordship had
just introduced himself, replies: Ah ?
And I am Cyrano Savinien Hercule de
Bergerac.
	If Cyrano can shine as a wit, he can
burn as a lover. Though spokesman
for anothers heart, his words pour forth
straight from his own. In the tumult of
his feelings, he forgets everything but
his own love. But all the while a quaint
affectation that might rival Lovelace
clings to his speech in a charming ex~
travagance of simile and conceit : 
Un baiser,  quest ce?

Un point rose qnon met sur li da verbe
aimer;
Cest un secret qui prend la bouche ponr
oreille,
Un instant dinflni qui fait un bruit dabeille.
A Sidney would, we fear, have num-
bered this lover
Of	them who in their lips loves standard
wear.

	When Cyrano grows old, as is the
way of life, his charm declines. He
comes on the stage feeble and wounded.
It is not in nature nor in art that his at-
traction should be strong as once it was.
And yet though the play must needs be
rounded out, we half regret that we have
read the closing act. The heros name
shall not be spoken when we do not
think of him as he was in the heyday
of his romance.
	Roxane is a perfect type of the pre-
cieuse. A past mistress of affectation,
she never wants for wit or spirit. About
these central figures cluster a score of
minor characters. The play itself sweeps
forward with a rush of splendid spirit.
Jest follows jest; retort, retort; and there
is action in every line. The verse, where
it is not broken up in conversation too
greatly to allow it, is fluent and melodi-
ous, and shows the stamp of careful
workmanship. The songs are full of
fire, and go dashing along in an infec-
tious metre that will not leave the mind
at rest. We defy anybody to listen to
Ce sont les cadets de Gascogne, and
then to go home and forget its gay re-
frain. A man might as well stuff his
fingers in his ears, and swear he should
not know the Marseillaise when next he
heard it. In the fourth act the fight is</PB>

worthy of a place in the bastion of the
Three Musketeers before La Rochelle.
The duel in the first outrivals Bob
Acress bout with Sir Lucius. We scarce-
ly know how we had rather spend an
evening than in watching M. Coquelin
play Cyrano de Bergerac.
	For M. Rostand himself our hopes
are high. His is a lucky star, and since
his birth it has been in the ascendant.
He has never played at buffets with the
world. Fortunately for him, his ances-
tors have spent their days upon high
stools, and he is free to court the muses
in a drawing-room. Thus far, comfort
has not spoiled him, and success has but
served to sharpen his ambition. His
education is of the best, he is young, and
he has ideals. Let us trust that he will
follow them.

the mighty drama which is going on
around him. If any one of us under-
takes to set this down, he should do it
with the utmost truth and simplicity;
not as if Seneca or Tacitus or St. Paul
were speaking, but as he himself, plain
Hodge or Dominie or Mrs. Grundy, is
moved to speak. He should not bor-
row from others the sentiments which
he ought to have entertained, but relate
truthfully how matters appeared to him,
as they and he went on. Thus much I
can promise to do in these pages, and
no more.

	The attention bestowed upon impres-
sions of childhood to-day will, I hope,
justify me in recording some of the ear-
liest points in consciousness which I still
recall.
	I remember when a thimble was first
given to me, some simple bit of work be-
ing at the same time placed in my hand.
Some one said, Take the needle in this
hand. I did so, and, placing the thim-
ble on a finger of the other hand, I began
to sew without its aid, to the amusement
of my teacher. This trifle appears to me
an early indication of a want of percep-
tion as to the use of tools which has ac-
companied me through life. I remember
also that, being told that I must ask par-
don for some childish fault, I said to my
mother, with perfect contentment, Oh
yes, I pardon you, and was surprised
to hear that in this way I had not made
the amende honorable.
	I encountered great difficulty in acquir-
ing the th sound, when my mother tried
to teach me to call her by that name.
Muzzer, muzzer, was all that I could
manage to say. But the dear parent
presently said, If you cannot do bet-
ter than that, you will have to go back
and call me mamma. The shame of
going back moved me to one last effort,
and, summoning my utmost strength of
tongue, I succeeded in saying mother,
an achievement from which I was never
obliged to recede.
	A journey up the Hudson River was
undertaken, when I was very young, for
the bettering of my mothers health. An
older sister of hers went with us, as
well as a favorite waiting-woman, and a
young physician whose care had saved
my fathers life a year or more before
my own birth. After reaching Albany,
we traveled in my fathers carriage; the
grown persons occupying the seats, and
I sitting in my little chair at their feet.
A book of short tales and poems was
often resorted to for my amusement, and
I still remember how the young doctor
read to me, Pity the sorrows of a poor
old man, and how my tears came, and
could not be hidden.
	The sight of Niagara caused me much
surprise. Playing on the piazza of the
hotel, one day, with only the doctor for
my companion, I ventured to ask him,
Who made that great hole where the
water comes down? He replied, The
great Maker of all. Who is that?
I innocently inquired; and he said, Do
you not know? Our Father who art in
heaven. I felt that I ought to have
known, and went away somewhat
abashed.
	Another day, niy mother told me that
we were going to visit Red Jacket, a
great Indian chief, and that I must be
very polite to him. She gave me a twist
of tobacco tied with a blue ribbon, which
I was to present to him, and bade me
observe the silver medal which I should
see hung on his neck, and which, she
said, had been given to him by General
Washington. We drove to the Indian
encampment, of which I dimly remem-
ber the extent and the wigwams. A
tall figure advanced to the carriage. As
its door was opened, I sprang forward,
clasped my arms around the neck of the
noble savage, and was astonished at his
cool reception of such a greeting. I was
surprised and grieved afterwards to learn
that I had not done exactly the right
thing. The Indians, in those days and
long after, occupied numerous settlements</PB>

in the western part of the state of New
York, where one often saw the boys with
their bows and arrows, and the squaws
carrying their papooses on their backs.
	The journey here mentioned must have
taken place when I was little more than
four years old. Another year and a
half brought me the burden of a great
sorrow. I recall months of sweet com-
panionship with the first and dearest of
friends, my mother. The last summer
of her life was passed at a fine country-
seat in Bloomingdale, which was then a
picturesque country place, about six miles
from New York, but is now incorporated
in the city.
	I remember this summer as a partic-
ularly happy period. My younger bro-
ther and I had our lessons in a lovely
green bower. Our French teacher caine
out at intervals in the Bloomingdale
stage. My mother often took me with
her for a walk in the beautiful garden,
from which she plucked flowers that she
arranged with great taste. There was
much mysterious embroidering of small
caps and gowns, the purpose of which I
little guessed. The autumn came, and
with it our return to town. And then,
one bitter morning, I awoke to hear the
words, Little Julia, your mother is
dead. Before this my father had an-
nounced to us that a little sister had ar-
rived. And she can open and shut her
eyes, he said, smiling.
	His grief at the loss of my mother was
so intense as to lay him prostrate with ill-
ness. He told me, years after this time,
that he had welcomed the physical ago-
ny which perforce diverted his thoughts
from the cause of his mental suffering.
The little sister of whose coming he had
told us so joyfully was for a long time
kept from his sight. The rest of us were
gathered around him, but this feeble lit-
tle creature was not asked for. At last
my dear old grandfather came to visit
us, and learned the state of my fathers
feelings. The old gentleman went into
the nursery, took the tiny infant from
its nurse, and laid it in my fathers arms.
The little one thenceforth became the ob-
ject of his most tender affection.
	He regarded all his children with great
solicitude, feeling, as he afterward said
to one of us, that he must now be mother
as well as father. My mothers last re-
quest had been that her unmarried sis-
ter, the same one who had accompanied
us on the journey to Niagara, should be
sent for to have charge of us, and this
arrangement was speedily effected.
	This aunt of ours had long been a care-
taker in her mothers household, where
she had had much to do with bringing up
her younger sisters and brothers. My
mother had been accustomed to borrow
her from time to time, and my aunt had
threatened to hang out a sign over the
door with the inscription, Cheering done
here by the job, by E. Cutler. She was
a person of rare honesty, entirely consci-
entious in character, possessed of few ac-
complishments, but endowed with the
keenest sense of humor. She watched
over our early years with incessant care.
We little ones were kept much in our
warm nursery. We were taken out for
a drive in fine weather, but rarely went
out on foot. As a consequence of this
overcherishing, we were constantly liable
to suffer from colds and sore throats.
The young physician of whom I have al-
ready spoken became an inmate of our
house soon after my mothers death. He
was afterward well known in New York
society as an excellent practitioner, and
as a man of a certain genius. Those
were the days of mighty doses, and the
slightest indisposition was sure to call
down upon us the administration of the
drugs then in favor with the faculty, but
now rarely used.
	My fathers affliction was such that a
change of scene became necessary for
him. The beautiful house at the Bowl-
ing Green was sold, with the new furni-
ture which had been ordered expressly
for my mothers pleasure, and which we
never saw uncovered. We removed to</PB>

Bond Street, which was then at the upper
extremity of New York city. My fa-
thers friends said to him, Mr. Ward,
you are going out of town. And so
indeed it seemed at that time. We oc-
cupied one of three white freestone
houses, and saw from our windows the
gradual building up of the street, which
is now in the central part of New York.
My father had purchased a large lot of
land at the corner of our street and
Broadway. On a part of this he subse-
quently erected a house which was con-
sidered one of the finest in the city.
	My father was disposed to be extreme-
ly careful in the choice of our associates,
and intended, no doubt, that we should
receive our education at home. At a la-
ter day his plans were changed some-
what, and after some experience of gov-
ernesses and masters I was at last sent
to a school in the near neighborhood of
our house. I was nine years old at this
time, somewhat precocious for my age,
and endowed with a good memory. This
fact may have led to my being at once
placed in a class of girls much older than
myself, especially occupied with the
study of Paleys Moral Philosophy. I
managed to commit many pages of this
book to memory, in a rather listless and
perfunctory manner. I was much more
interested in the study of chemistry, al-
though it was not illustrated by any ex-
periments. The system of education
followed at that time consisted largely
in memorizing from the textbooks then
in use. Removing to another school, I
had excellent instruction in penmanship,
and enjoyed a course of lectures on his-
tory, aided by the best set of charts that
I have ever seen, the work of Professor
Bostwick. In geometry I made quite
a brilliant beginning, but soon fell off
from my first efforts. The study of lan-
guages was very congenial to me; I had
been accustomed to speak French from
my earliest years. To this I was enabled
to add some knowledge of Latin, and af-
terward of Italian and German.
	The routine of my school life was
varied now and then by a concert and by
Handels oratorios, which were given at
long intervals by an association whose
title I cannot now recall. I eagerly
anticipated, and yet dreaded, these oc-
casioiis, for my enjoyment of the music
was succeeded by a reaction of intense
melancholy.
	The musical stars of those days
are probably quite out of memory in
these later times, but I remember some
of them with pleasure. It is worth no-
ticing that, while the earliest efforts in
music in Boston produced the Handel
and Haydn Society, and led to the occa-
sional performance of a symphony of
Beethoven or of Mozart, the musical
taste of New York inclined more to oper-
atic music. The brief visit of Garcia and
his troupe had brought the best works
of Rossini before the public. These
performances were followed, at long
intervals, by seasons of English opera,
in which Mrs. Austin was the favorite
prima donna. This lady sang also in
oratorio, and I recall her rendering of
the soprano solos in Handels Messiah
as somewhat mannered, but on the
whole quite impressive.
	A higher grade of talent came to us
in the person of Mrs. Wood, famous be-
fore her marriage as Miss Paton. I
heard great things of her performance
in La Sonnambula, which I was not al-
lowed to see. I did hear her, however,
at concerts and in oratorios, and I par-
ticularly remember her rendering of the
famous soprano song, To mighty kings
he gave his acts. Her voice was beau-
tiful in quality and of considerable ex-
tent. It possessed a liquid and fluent
flexibility, quite unlike the curious stac-
cato and tremolo effects so much in
favor to-day.
	My fathers views of religious duty
became much more stringent after my
mothers death. I had been twice taken
to the opera during the Garcia perform-
ances, when I was scarcely more than</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00843" SEQ="0843" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="837">	Reminiscences of Julia Ward Howe.	837
seven years of age, and had seen and
heard the Diva Malibran, then known
as Signorina Garcia, in the r6les of
Cenerentola (Cinderella) and Rosina in
the Barbiere di Seviglia. Soon after
this time the doors were shut, and I
knew of theatrical matters only by hear-
say. The religious people of that period
had set their faces against the drama
in every form. I remember the destruc-
tion by fire of the first Bowery Theatre,
and how this was spoken of as a judg-
ment upon the wickedness of the stage
and of its patrons. A well-known thea-
tre in Richmond, Virginia, took fire while
a performance was going on, and the re-
sult was a deplorable loss of life. The
pulpits of the time improved this
event by sermons which reflected severe-
ly upon the frequenters of such places of
amusement, and the judgment was
long spoken of with holy horror.
	My musical education, in spite of the
limitations of opportunity just men-
tioned, was the best that the time could
afford. I had my first lessons in musi-
cal notation from a very irritable French
artist, o~ whom I stood in such fear that
I could remember nothing that he taught
me. A second teacher, Mr. Boocock,
had more patience, and soon brought
me forward in my studies. He had
been a pupil of Cramer, and his taste
had been formed by hearing the best
music in London, which then, as now,
commanded all the great musical talent
of Europe. He gave me lessons for
many years, and I learned from him to
appreciate the works of the great com-
posers, Beethoven, Handel, and Mozart.
When I grew old enough for the train-
ing of my voice, Mr. Boocock recom-
mended to my father Signor Cardini, an
aged Italian, who had been an inmate of
the Garcia family, and was well acquaint-
ed with Garcias admirable method.
Under his care my voice improved in
character and in compass, and the daily
exercises in holding long notes gave
strength to my lungs. I think that I
have felt all my life through the benefit
of those early lessons. Signor Cardini
remembered Italy before the invasion
of Napoleon I., and sometimes enter-
tained me with stories of the escapades
of his student life. He had resided
long in London, and had known the
Duke of Wellington. He related to me
that once, when he was visiting the great
soldier at his country-seat near the sea,
the duke invited him to look through
his telescope, saying, Signor Cardini,
venez voir coinme on travaille les Fran-
~ais. This must have had reference to
some mnwnuvre of the English fleet, I
suppose. Mr. Boocock thought that it
would be desirable for me to take part
in concerted pieces, with other instru-
ments. This exercise brought me great
delight in the performance of certain
trios and quartettes. The reaction from
this pleasure, however, was very painful,
and induced at times a visitation of mor-
bid melancholy which threatened to af-
fect my health.
	While I greatly disapprove of the
scope and suggestions presented by
Count Tolstoi in his Kreutzer Sonata, I
yet think that, in the training of young
persons, some regard should be had to
the sensitiveness of youthful nerves, and
to the overpowering response which they
often make to the appeals of music. The
dry practice of a single instrument and
the simple drill of choral exercises will
not be apt to overstimulate the currents
of nerve force. On the other hand, the
power and sweep of great orchestral per-
formances, or even the suggestive charm
of some beautiful voice, will sometimes
so disturb the mental equilibrium of the
hearer as to induce in him a listless me-
lancholy, or, worse still, an unreasoning
and unreasonable discontent.
	The early years of my youth were
passed in the seclusion not only of a
home life, but of a home most careful-
ly and jealously guarded from all that
might be represented in the orthodox
trinity of evil, the world, the flesh, and</PB>

the devil. My father had become deeply
imbued with the religious ideas of the
time. He dreaded for his children the
dissipations of fashionable society, and
even the risks of general intercourse
with the unsanctified many. He early
embraced the cause of temperance, and
became president of the first temperance
society formed in this country. As a
result, wine was excluded from his table.
This privation gave me no trouble, but
my brothers felt it, especially the eldest,
who had passed some years in Europe,
where the use of wine was, as it still
is, universal. I was walking with my
father one evening when we met my
two younger brothers, each with a cigar
in his mouth. My father was much
troubled, and said, Boys, you must
give this up, and I will give it up, too.
From this time I forbid you to smoke,
and I will join you in relinquishing the
habit. I am afraid that this sacrifice
on my fathers part did not have the de-
sired effect, but am quite certain that he
never witnessed the infringement of his
command.
	At the time of which I speak, my fa-
thers family all lived in our immediate
neighborhood. He bad considerably dis-
tanced his brothers in fortune, and had
built for himself the beautiful house of
which I have already spoken. In the
same street with us lived my music-lov-
ing uncle, Henry, somewhat given to
good cheer, and of a genial disposition.
In a house nearer to us resided my
grandfather, Samuel Ward, with an un-
married daughter and three bachelor
sons, John, Richard, and William. The
outings of my young-girlhood were con-
fined to this family circle. I went to
school, indeed, but never to dancing-
school, a sober little dancing-master giv-
ing us lessons at home. I used to hear,
with some envy, of Monsieur Chariots
classes and of his publics, where my
schoolfellows disported themselves in
their best clothes. My grandfather was
a stately old gentleman, a good deal
more than six feet in height, very mild
in manner, and fond of a game of whist.
With us children he used to play a very
simple game called Tom, come tickle
me. Cards were not allowed in my
fathers house, and my brothers used to
resort to the grand-paternal mansion
when they desired this diversion.
	The eldest of my fathers brothers
was my uncle John, a man more toler-
ant than my father, and full of kindly
forethought for his nieces and nephews.
In his youth he had sustained an injury
which deprived him of speech for more
than a year. His friends feared that he
would never speak again, but his mother,
trying one day to render him some small
assistance, did not succeed to her mind,
and said, I am a poor, awkward old
woman. No, you are not! he ex-
claimed, and at once recovered his power
of speech. He was anxious that his nieces
should be well instructed in practical mat-
ters, and perhaps be grudged a little the
extra time which we w,ere accustomed
to devote to books and music. He was
fond of sending materials for dresses to
me and my sisters, but insisted that we
should make them up for ourselves. This
we managed to do, with a good deal of
help from the family seamstress. When
I had published my first literary venture,
uncle John showed me in a newspaper
a favorable notice of my work, saying,
This is my little girl who knows about
books, and writes an article and has it
printed, but I wish that she knew more
about housekeeping,  a sentiment
which in after years I had occasion to
echo with fervor.
Julia Ward Howe.</PB>

THE BATTLE OF THE STRONG.

XL.

	D~TRICAND, Prince of Vaufontaine,
was no longer in the Vend6e. The whole
of Brittany was in the hands of the vic-
torious Hoche, the peasants were dis-
banded, and his work for a time, at least,
was done.
	On the same day of that momentous
scene in the Cohue Royale when Guida
was vindicated, D6tricand had carried
to Granville the Comtesse Chantavoine,
who presently was passed over to the
loving care of her kinsman, General
Grandjon-Larisse. This done, he pro-
ceeded to England.
	From London he communicated with
Grandjon-Larisse, who applied himself
to secure from the Directory leave for
the Chouan chieftain to return to France,
with amnesty for his past rebellion.
This was got at last through the influ-
ence of young Bonaparte himself. D6-
tricand was free now to proceed against
Philip.
	He straightway devoted himself to a
thing conceived on the day when Guida
was restored to her rightful status as a
wife. His purpose was to wrest from
Philip the duchy of Bercy. Philip was
heir by adoption only, and the inherit-
ance had been secured at the last by help
of a lie. Surely his was a righteous
cause!
	His motives had not their origin in
hatred of Philip alone, nor in desire for
honors and estates for himself, nor in
racial antagonism; for had he not been
allied with England in this war against
the government? He hated Philip the
man, but he hated still more Philip the
usurper who had brought shame to the
escutcheon of Bercy. There was also
at work another and a deeper design, to
be shown in good time.
	Philip had retired from the English
navy, and gone back to his duchy of
Bercy. Here he threw himself into the
struggle with the Austrians against the
French. Received with enthusiasm by
the people, who as yet knew little or
nothing of the doings in the Cohue
Royale, he now took over command of
the army, and proved himself almost as
able in the field as he had been at sea.
	Of these things D~tricand knew, and
knew also that the lines were closing in
round the dlichy; that one day soon Bo-
naparte would send a force which would
strangle the little army and its Austrian
allies. The game then would be another
step nearer the end.
	Free to move at will, he visited the
courts of Prussia, Russia, Spain, Italy,
and Austria, and laid before them his
claims to the duchy; urging an insistence
on its neutrality, and a trial of his cause
against Philip. Ceaselessly, adroitly,
with persistence and power, he toiled
toward his end, the way made easier by
tales told of his prowess in the Vend~e.
He had offers without number to take
service in foreign armies, but he was not
to be tempted. Gossip of the courts said
that there was some strange romance be-
hind this tireless pursuit of an inherit-
ance, but he paid no heed. If at last
there crept over Europe wonderful tales
of D6tricands past life in Jersey, of the
real Duchesse de Bercy and of the new
Prince of Vaufontaine, D~tricand did
not, or feigned not to hear them; and the
Comtesse Chantavoine had disappeared
from public knowledge. The few who
guessed his romance were puzzled to
understand his course; for if he dispos-
sessed Philip, Guida must also be dispos-
sessed. This, certainly, was not lover-
like or friendly.

 Guida, who, as they left the Cohue
Royale that day of days, had turned on
him a look of heavenly trust and grati-
tude; who, in the midst of her own great
happenings~ found time to tell him by a
word how well she knew he had kept his
promise to her, even beyond belief. Jus-
tice for her was now the supreme and
immediate object of his life. There were
others ready to care for France, to fight
for her, to die for her, to struggle toward
the hour when the King should come to
his own; but there was only one man in
the world who could achieve Guidas full
justification, and that was himself, D6tri-
cand of Vaufontaine.
	He was glad to turn to the chevaliers
letters from Jersey. It was from the
chevaliers lips he had learned the whole
course of Guidas life during the four
years of his absence from the island. It
was the chevalier wh&#38; drew for him pic-
tures of Guida in her new home,  none
other than the house of Elie Mattingley,
which the Royal Court having confiscat-
ed now handed over to her as an act
of homage. The little world of Jersey
no longer pointed the finger of scorn at
Guida Landresse de Landresse, but bent
the knee to Princess Guida dAvranche.
	D6tricand wrote many letters to the
chevalier, and they, with their cheerful
and humorous allusions, were read aloud
to Guida,  all save one. Writing of
himself to the chevalier on one occasion,
he laid bare with a merciless honesty his
nature and his career. Concerning nei-
ther had he any illusions.
	I do not mistake myself, chevalier,
he wrote, nor these late doings of mine.
What credit shall I take to myself for
coming to place and some little fame?
Everything has been with me: the
chance of inheritance; the glory of a
cause as hopeless as splendid, and more
splendid because hopeless; and the luck
of him who loads the dice,  for all my
old comrades, the better men, are dead,
and I, the least of them all, remain, hav-
ing even outlived the cause. What praise
shall I take for this? None,  from
all decent fellows of the earth, none at
all. It is merely laughable that I should
be left, the monument of a sacred loyab
ty the greatest that the world has ever
known.
	I have no claims  But let me draw
the picture, dear chevalier. Here was
a discredited, dissolute fellow whose life
was worth a pin to nobody. Tired of
the husks and the swine, and all his fol-
lies grown stale by overuse, he takes the
advice of a good gentleman and joins the
standard of work and sacrifice. What
greater luxury shall man ask? If this
be not running the full scale of lifes en-
joyment, pray you what is! The world
loves contrasts. The deep-dyed sinner
raising the standard of piety is pictur-
esque. If, charmed by his own new vir-
tues, he is constant in his enthusiasm,
behold a St. Augustine! Everything is
with the returned prodigal,  the more
so if he be of the notorious Vaufontaines,
who were ever saints turned sinners, or
sinners turned saints.
	Tell me, my good friend, where is
room for pride in me? I am getting
far more out of life than I deserve; it
is not well that you and others should
think better of me than I do of myself.
I do not pretend that I dislike it; it is
as balm to me. But it would seem that
the world is monstrously unjust. One
day, when I m grown old,  I cannot
imagine what else Fate has spared me
for,  I shall write the Diary of a Sin-
ner, the whole truth. I shall tell how,
when my peasant fighters were kneeling
round me praying for success, even
thanking God for me, I was smiling in
my glove,  in scorn of myself, not of
them, chevalier; no, no, not of them!
The peasants is the true greatness.
Everything is with the aristocrat; he
has to kick the great chances from his
path, but the peasant must go hunting
them in peril. Hardly snatching suste-
nance from Fate, the peasant fights into
greatness; the aristocrat may only win</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00847" SEQ="0847" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="841">	The Battle of the Strong.	841

to it by rejecting Fates luxuries. The
peasant never escapes the austere teach-
ing of hard experience; the aristocrat, the
languor of good fortune. There is the
peasant, and there am I. VoiTh! enough
of D6tricand of Vaufontaine. The Prin-
cess Guida and the child, are they  
So the letter ran, and the chevalier
read it aloud to Guida up to the point
where her name was writ. Afterward
Guida would sit and think of what D6-
tricand had said, and of the honesty of
nature that never allowed him to deceive
himself. It pleased her, also, to think
she had in some small way helped a man
to the rehabilitation of his life. He had
said that she had helped him, and she
believed him; he had proved the sound-
ness of his aims and ambitions; his ca-
reer was in the worlds mouth.
	The one letter the chevalier did not
read to Guida referred to Philip. In it
Wtricand begged the chevalier to hold
himself in readiness to proceed at a days
notice to Paris.
	So it was that when, after months of
waiting, the chevalier suddenly left St.
Heliers to join D~tricand, Guida did
not know the object of his journey. All
she knew was that he had leave from
the Directory to visit Paris. Imagining
this to mean some good fortune for him,
with a light heart she sent him off in
charge of Jean Touzel, who took him to
St. Malo in the Hardi Biaou, and saw
him safely into the hands of an escort
from D6tricand.

	Three days later there wa~ opened in
one of the chambers of the Emperors
palace at Vienna a congress of four na-
tions, Prussia, Russia, Austria, and Sar-
dinia. D6tricands labors had achieved
this result at last. Grandjon-Larisse,
his old enemy in battle, now his person-
al friend and colleague in this business,
had influenced Napoleon, and the Direc-
tory through him, to respect the neutral-
ity of the duchy of Bercy, for which the
four nations of this congress declared.
Philip himself little knew whose hand
had secured the neutrality, until sum-
moned to appear at the congress to de-
fend his rights to the title and the duchy
against those of D6trican.d, Prince of
Vaufontaine. Had he known that D6-
tricand was behind it all, he would have
fought on to the last gasp of power and
died on the battlefield. He realized now
that such a fate was not for him; that he
must fight, not on the field of battle like
a prince, but in a court of nations like
a doubtful claimant of sovereign honors.
	His whole story had become known in
the duchy; and though it begot no feel-
ing against him in war-time, now that
Bercy was in a neutral zone of peace
there was much talk of the wrongs
Guida and the Countess Chantavomne.
He became moody and saturnine, and
saw few of his subjects save the old
governor-general and his whilom enemy,
now his friend, Count Carignan Damour.
That at last he should choose to accom-
pany him to Vienna the man who had
been his foe during the lifetime of the
old duke seemed incomprehensible. Yet,
to all appearance, Damour was now
Philips zealous adherent. He came
frankly repemjting his old enmity; and
though Philip did not quite believe him,
some perverse temper, some obliquity of
vision which overtakes the ablest minds
at times, made him almost eagerly accept
his new partisan. One thing Philip
knew: Damour had no love for D6tricand,
who indeed had lately sent him word that
for his work in sending Fouch6s men to
attempt his capture in Bercy he would
have him shot, if the court of nations
upheld Detricands rights to the duchy.
Damour was able, even if Damour was
not honest. Damour, the able, the im-
placable and malignant, should accom-
pany him to Vienna.

	The opening ceremony of the con-
gress was simple, but it was made nota-
ble by the presence of the Emperor of
Austria, who addressed a few words of</PB>

welcome to the envoys, to Philip, and,
very pointedly, to the representative of
the French nation, the aged Duc de
Mauban, who, while taking no active
part in the congress, was present by re-
quest of the Directory. The dukes long
residence in Vienna and freedom from
share in the civil war in France had been
factors in the choice of him when his name
was submitted to the Directory by Gen-
eral Grandjon - Larisse, upon whom in
turn it had been urged by D6tricand.
	The Duc de Mauban was the most
marked figure of the court, the Empe-
ror not excepted. Clean-shaven, with
snowy linen and lace, his own natural
hair, silver white, tied in a queue be-
hind, he had large, eloquent, wondering
eyes that seemed always looking, look-
ing beyond the thing he saw. At first
sight of him at his court, the Emperor
had said, The stars have frightened
him. No fanciful supposition, for the
Duc de lXlauban was equally well known
as astronomer and as student of history
and philanthropist.
	When the Emperor mentioned de
Maubans name, Philip wondered where
he had heard it before. Something in
the sound of it was associated with his
past,  he knew not how. He had a cu-
rious feeling, too, that those deliberate,
searching dark eyes saw the end of this
fight, this battle of the strong. The
face fascinated him, though it awed him.
He admired it, even as he detested the
ardent strength of D6tricands face,
where the wrinkles of dissipation had
given way to the bronzed carven look of
the war-beaten soldier.
	It was fair battle between these two,
and there was enough hatred in the
heart of each to make the fight deadly.
Philip knew  and he had known since
that day, years ago, in the Place du
Yier Prison  that D6tricand loved the
girl whom be himself had married and
dishonored. He felt, also, that D6tri-
cand was making this claim to the duchy
more out of vengeance than from desire
to secure the title for himself. He read
the whole deep scheme how D6tricand
had laid his mine at every court in Eu-
rope to bring him to this pass.
	For hours Philips witnesses were ex-
amined, among them the officers of his
duchy and Count Carignan Damour.
The physician of the old Duke of Bercy
was examined, and the evidence was with
Philip. The testimony of Dalbarade,
the French ex-minister of marine, was
read and considered. Philips story, up
to the point of the formal signature by
the old duke, was straightforward and
clear. So far the court was in his favor.
	D6tricand, as natural heir of the
duchy, combated each step in the pro-
ceedings from the standpoint of legal-
ity, of the dukes fatuity concerning
Philip and his personal hatred of the
house of Vaufontaine. On the third
day, when the congress would give its
decision, D6tricand brought the cheva-
lier to the palace. At the opening of
the sitting he requested that Damour be
examined again. The count was asked
what question had been put to Philip
immediately before the deeds of inher-
itance were signed. It was useless for
Damour to evade the point, for there
were other officers of the duchy present
who could have told the truth. Yet this
truth, of itself, need not ruin Philip. It
was no phenomenon for a prince to have
one wife unknown, and, coming to the
throne, to take to himself another more
exalted.
	D6tricand was hoping that the nice
legal senseof mine and thine would be
suddenly weighted in his favor by a pre-
pared tour de force. The sympathies of
the congress were largely with himself,
for he was of the order of the nobility, and
Philips descent must be traced through
centuries of yeoman blood ; vet there
was the deliberate adoption by the duke
to face, with the formal assent of the
states of Bercy, but little lessened in value
by the fact that the French government
had sent its emissaries to Bercy to pro-</PB>

test against it. The court had come to a
point where decision upon the exact legal
merits of the case was difficult.
	After Damour had testified to the ques-
tion the duke asked Philip when signing
the deeds at Bercy, D6tricand begged
leave to introduce another witness, and
brought in the chevalier. Now he made
his great appeal. Simply, powerfully, he
told the story of Philips secret marriage
with Guida, and of all that came after,
up to the scene in the Cohue Royale when
the marriage was proved and the child
given back to Guida; when the Countess
Chantavoine, turning from Philip, ac-
knowledged to Guida the justice of her
claim. He drove home the truth with
bare, unvarnished power,  the wrong to
Guida, the wrong to the countess, the
wrong to the dukedom of Bercy, to that
honor which should belong to those in
high estate. Then at the last he told
them who Guida was: no peasant girl,
but the granddaughter of the Sieur Lar-
chant do Mauprat, of the de Mauprats
of Chamb~ry,  the granddaughter of
an exile, indeed, but of I~he noblest blood
of France.
	The old Due de Mauban fixed his look
on him intently, and as the story pro-
ceeded his hand grasped the table before
him in strong emotion. When at the
close D6tricand turned to the chevalier
and asked him to bear witness to the
truth of what he had said, the duke, in
agitation, whispered to the president.
	All that D~tricand had said had moved
the court profoundly; but when the
withered little flower of a man, the che-
valier, told in quaint, brief sentences the
story of the Sieur de Mauprat, his suf-
ferings, his exile, and the nobility of his
family, which had indeed, far back, come
of royal stock, and then finally of Guida
and the child, more than one member
of the court turned his head away with
misty eyes.
	It remained for the Due de Mauban
to speak the word which hastened and
compelled the end. Rising in his place,
he addressed to the court a few words
of apology, inasmuch as he was without
real authority there, and then he turned
to the ch~valier.
	Monsieur le Chevalier, said he, I
had the honor to know you in some-
what better days for both of us. You
will allow me to greet you here with my
profound respect. The Sieur Larchant
do Mauprat,  he turned to the pre-
sident, his voice became louder,  the
Sicur do Mauprat was my friend. He
was with me upon the day I married
the Duchess Guidabaldine. Trouble,
exile, caine to him. Years passed, and
at last in Jersey I saw him again. It
was the very day his grandchild was
born. The name given to her was Gui-
dabaldine,  the name of the Duchesse
de Mauban. She was Guidabaldine
Landresse de Landresse; she is my
godchild. There is no better blood in
France than that of the de Mauprats of
Chamb6~y, and the grandchild of my
friend  her father being also of good
Norman blood  was worthy to be the
wife of any prince in Europe. I speak
in the name of our order, I speak for
Frenchmen, I speak for France. If
D~tricand, Prince of Vaufontaine, be
not secured in his right of succession to
the dukedom of Bercy, France will not
cease to protest till protest hath done its
work. From France the duchy of Bercy
came. It was the gift of a French king
to a Frenchman, and she hath some claims
upon the courtesy of the nations.
	For a moment after he took his seat
there was absolute silence. Then the
president wrote upon a paper before
him, and it was passed to each member
of the court sitting with him. For a
moment longer there was nothing heard
save the scratching of a quill. Philip
recalled that day at Bercy when the duke
stooped and signed his name upon the
deed of adoption and succession three
times,  three fateful times.
	Then the president, rising in his place,
read the pronouncement of the court:</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00850" SEQ="0850" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="844">	844	The Battle of the Strong.
that D6tricand, Prince of Vaufontaine,
be declared true inheritor of the duchy of
Bercy, the nations represented here con-
firming him in his title.
	The president having spoken, Philip
rose, and, bowing to the congress with
dignity and composure, left the chamber
with Count Carignan Damour.
	As he passed from the portico into the
grounds of the palace, a figure came sud-
denly from behind a pillar and touched
him on the arm. He turned quickly, and
received upon the face a blow from a
glove.
	The owner of the glove was General
Grandjon-Larisse.


XLI.

	You understand, monsieur? said
Grandjon-Larisse.
	Perfectly,  and without the glove,
Monsieur le G6n6ral, answered Philip
quietly. Where shall my seconds wait
upon you? As he spoke he turned
with a slight gesture toward Damour.
	In Paris, monsieur, if it please you.
	I should have preferred it here,
Monsieur le G6n6ral; but Paris, if it is
your choice.
	At 22, Rue de Mazarin, monsieur.
Then, with an elaborate bow to Philip,
I bid you good-day, monsieur.
	Afonsejaneur, not monsieur, Philip
corrected. They may deprive me of
my duchy, but I am still Prince Philip
dAvranche. I may not be robbed of
my adoption.
	There was something so steady, so
infrangible, in Philips composure now
that Grandjon-Larisse, who had come
to challenge a great adventurer, a ma-
rauder of honor, found his furious con-
tempt checked by some integral power
resisting disdain. He intended to kill
Philip,  he was one of the most expert
swordsmen in France,  yet he was con-
strained to respect a composure not sang-
froid, and a firmness in misfortune not
bravado. Philip was still the man who
had valiantly commanded men, who had
held of the high places of the earth. In
whatever adventurous blood his pur-
poses had been conceived or his doubt-
ful plans accomplished, he was still,
stripped of power, a man to be reckoned
with,  resolute in his course once set
upon, and impulsive toward good as
toward evil. He was never so much
worth respect as when, a dispossessed
sovereign with an empty title, discoun-
tenanced by his order, disbarred his pro-
fession, he held himself ready to take
whatever penalty came.
	In the presence of General Graudjon-
Larisse, with whom was the might of
righteous vengeance, he was the more
distinguished figure. To Philip now
there came the cold quiet of the sinner
great enough to rise above physical
fear, proud enough to say to the world,
Come, I pay the debt I owe. We are
quits. You have no favors to give, and
I none to take. You have no pardon to
grant, and I none to ask.
	At parting Grandjon-Larisse bowed
to Philip with great politeness, and said,
In Paris, then, Monsieur le Prince.
	Philip bowed his head in assent.

	When they met again, it was at the
entrance to the Bois de Boulogne near
the Maillot gate.
	It was a damp, gray morning, imme-
diately before sunrise, and at first there
was scarce light enough for the combat-
ants to see each other perfectly; but both
were eager and would not delay.
	As they came on guard the sun rose.
Philip, where he stood, was full in its
light. He took no heed, and they en-
gaged at once. After a few passes
Grandjon-Larisse said, You are in the
light, monseigneur; the sun shines full
upon you, and he pointed to the shade
of a wall nearby. It is darker there.
	One of us must certainly be in the
dark  soon, answered Philip grimly,
but he removed to the wall.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00851" SEQ="0851" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="845">	The Battle of the Strong.	845

	From the first Philip took the offen-
sive. He was more active, and he was
quicker and lighter of fence, than his
antagonist. But Grandjon-Larisse had
the surer eye, and was invincibly certain
of hand and strong of wrist. Presently
Philip wounded his opponent slightly in
the left breast, and the seconds came for-
ward to declare that honor was satisfied.
But neither would listen or heed; their
purpose was fixed to fight to the death.
They engaged again, and almost at once
the Frenchman was slightly wounded in
the wrist. Suddenly taking the offensive
and lunging freely, Grandjon - Larisse
drove Philip, now heated and less wary,
backwards upon the wall. At last, by a
dexterous feint, he beat aside Philips
guard, and drove the sword through his
right breast at one fierce lunge.
	With a moan Philip swayed and fell
forward into the arms of Damour.
	Graudjon-Larisse stooped to the in-
jured man. Unloosing his fingers from
the sword, Philip stretched up a hand
to his enemy.
	I am hurt to death, he said. Per-
mit my compliments to the best swords-
man I have ever known. Then, with
a touch of sorry humor, he added, You
cannot doubt their sincerity!
	Grandjon-Larisse was turning away,
when Philip called him back. Will
you carry my profound regret to the
Comtesse Chantavoine? he whispered.
Say that it lies with her whether Hea-
ven pardon me.
	Grandjon-Larisse hesitated an instant;
then answered, Those who are in hea-
ven, monseigneur, know best what Hea-
ven may do.
	Philips pale face took on a look of
agony. She is dead  she is dead!
he gasped.
	Grandjon-Larisse inclined his head;
then, after a moment, gravely said,
What did you think was left for a
woman, for a Chantavoine? It is not
the broken heart that kills, but broken
pride, monseigneur.
	So saying, he bowed again to Philip
and turned upon his heel.

	Philip lay on a bed in the unostenta-
tious lodging in the Rue de Vaugirard
where Damour had brought him. The
surgeon had pronounced the wound mor-
tal, giving him but a few hours to live.
For long after he was gone Philip was si-
lent, but at last he said, You heard what
Grandjon - Larisse said,  it is broken
pride that kills, Damour. Then he
asked for pen, ink, and paper. They
were brought to him. He tried the pen
upon the paper, but faintness suddenly
seized him, and he fell back unconscious.
	When he came to himself he was alone
in the room. It was cold and cheerless,
 no fire on the hearth, no light save
that flaring from a lamp in the street
outside his window. He rang the bell at
his hand. No one answered. He called
aloud, Damour! Damour!
	Damour was far beyond earshot. He
had bethought him that now his place
was in Bercy, where he might gather
up what fragments of good fortune re-
mained, what of Philips valuables might
be secured. Ere he had fallen back in-
sensible, Philip, in trying the pen, had
written his own name on a piece of
paper. Above this Damour wrote for
himself an order upon the chamberlain
of Bercy to enter Philips private apart-
ments in the castle; and thither he was
fleeing as Philip lay dying in the dark
room of the house in the Rue de Vau-
girard.
	The woman of the house, to whose care
Philip had been passed over by Damour,
had tired of watching, and had gone to
spend one of his goldpieces for supper
with her friends.
	Meanwhile, in the dark, comfortless
room, the light from without flickering
upon his lAanched face, Philip was alone
with himself, with memory, and with
death. As he lay gasping, a voice seemed
to ring through the silent room, repeat-
ing the same words again and again;</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00852" SEQ="0852" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="846">	846	The Battle of the Strong.

and the voice was his own voice. It was
himself  some other outside self of him
 saying, in tireless repetition: Ahy
I die a black, dishonorable death, aban-
doned and alone, ~f ever I deceive you.
I should deserve that, ~f I deceived you,
Guida! A black, dishonorable death,
abandoned and alone. It was like some
horrible dirge chanting in his ear.
	Pictures flashed before his eyes, strange
imaginings. Now he was passing through
dark corridors, and the stone floor be-
neath was cold,  so cold! He was go-
ing to some gruesome death, and monks
with voices like his own voice were in-
toning: Abandoned and alone. Alone
 alone  abandoned and alone.
And now he was fighting, fighting on
board the Araminta. There was the roar
of the great guns, the screaming of the
carronade slides, the rattle of musketry,
the groans of the dying, the shouts of his
victorious sailors, the crash of the main-
mast as it fell upon the bulwarks; then
the swift sissing ripple of water, the thud
of the Araminta as she struck, and the
cold chill of the seas as she went down.
How cold was the sea,  ah, how it chilled
every nerve and tissue of his body!
	He roused to consciousness again.
Here was still the blank, cheerless room;
the empty house; the lamplight flaring
through the window upon his stricken
face, upon the dark walls, upon the white
paper lying on the table beside him.
	Paper,  ah, that was it. He must
write,  he must write while he had
strength. With the last courageous ef-
fort of life, his strenuous will forcing the
declining powers into obedience for a
final combat, he drew the paper near and
began to write. The light flickered, wa-
vered; he could just see the letters that
he formed,  no more.

	Guida, he began, on the Ecr6hos
I said to you, If I deceive you, may I
die a black, dishonorable death, aban-
doned and alone! It has all come
true. You were right, always right, and
I was always wrong. I never started
fair with myself or with the world. I
was always in too great a hurry; I
was too ambitious, Guida. Ambition
has killed me, and it has killed her, 
the cointesse. She is gone. What was
it he said  if I could but remember
what Grandjon-Larisse said  ah yes,
yes !  after he had given me my death-
wound, he said, It is not the broken
heart that kills, but broken pride.
There is the truth. She is in her grave,
and I am going out into the dark.
	He lay back exhausted for a moment,
in desperate estate. The body was fight-
ing hard that the spirit might confess
itself before the vital spark died down
forever. Seizing a glass of cordial near,
he drank of it. The broken figure in its
mortal defeat roused itself again, leaned
over the paper, and a shaking hand traced
on the brief, piteous record of a life: 
I climbed too fast. Things dazzled
me. I thought too much of myself, 
myself, myself was everything always;
and myself has killed me. In wanton
haste I came to be admiral and sover-
eign duke, and it has all come to no-
thing,  nothing. I wronged you, I de-
nied you: there was the cause of all.
There is no one to watch with me now
to the one moment of life that counts.
In this hour the clock of time fills all
the space between earth and heaven. It
will strike soon,  the awful clock. It
will soon strike twelve: and then it will
be twelve of the clock for me always, 
always.
	I know you never wanted revenge
on me, Guida, but still you have it here.
My life is no more now than vraic upon
a rock. I cling, I cling, but that is all,
and the waves break over me. I am no
longer an admiral, I am no more a duke,
 I am nothing. It is all done. Of no
account with men, I am going to my
judgment with God. But you remain,
and you are Princess Philip dAvranche,
and your sonyour sonwill be
Prince Guilbert dAvranche. But I</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00853" SEQ="0853" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="847">	The Battle of the Strong.	847
can leave him naught, neither estates nor
power. There is little honor in the title
now, so it may be you will not use it.
But you will have a new life: with my
death happiness may begin again for you.
That thought makes death easier. I was
never worthy of you,  never. I under-
stand myself now, and I know that you
have read me all these years, read me
through and through. The letter you
wrote me, never a day or night has passed
but, one way or another, it has come home
to me.
There was a footfall outside his win-
dow. A roisterer went by in the light
of the flaring lamp. He was singing a
ribald song. A dog ran barking at his
heels. The reveler turned, drew his
sword, and ran the dog through, then
staggered on with his song. Philip shud-
dered, but, with a supreme effort, bent
to the table again, and wrote on : 
You were right: you were my star,
and I was so blind with selfishness and
vanity I could not see. I am speaking
the truth to you now, Guida. I believe
I might have been a great man, if I
had thought less of myself and more of
others, more of you. Greatness,  I
was mad for that, and my madness has
brought me to this desolate end, alone.
Go tell Maitresse Aimable that she too
was a good prophet. Tell her that, as
she foresaw, I called your name in
death, and you did not come! One
thing before all: teach your boy never
to try to be great, but always to live
well and to be just. Teach him, too,
that the world means better by him than
he thinks, and that lie must never treat
it as his foe; he must not try to force
its benefits and rewards; he must not
approach it like the highwayman. Tell
him never to flatter. That is the worst
fault in a gentleman; for flattery makes
false friends, and makes the flatterer him-
self false. Tell him that good address is
for ease and courtesy of life; but it must
not be used to ones secret advantage,
as I have used mine to mortal undoing.
If ever Guilbert be in great temptation,
tell him his fathers story, and read him
these words to you, written, as you see,
with the cramped fingers of death.
	He could scarcely hold the pen now,
and his eyes were growing dim.
	I am come to the end of niy
strength. I thought I loved you, Guida,
but I know now that it was not love, 
not real love. Yet it was all a twisted
manhood had to give. There are some
things of mine that you will keep for
your son, if you forgive me dead whom
you despised living. D6tricand, Duke
of Bercy, will deal honorably by you.
All that is mine at the castle of Bercy
he will secure to you. Tell him I have
written it so; though he will do it of
himself, I know. He is a great man.
As I have gone downward, he has come
upward. There has been a star in his
sky, too. I know it, I know it, Guida,
and he  he is not blind. He trem-
bled violently. The light is going. I
cannot see. I can only 
He struggled fiercely for breath, but
suddenly collapsed upon the table, and
his head fell forward upon the paper:
one cheek lying on the wet ink of his
last-written words; the other, cold and
stark, turned to the window. The light
from the lamp without flickered on it in
gruesome sportiveness. The eyes stared
and stared from the little dark room out
into the world; but they did n~t see.
	The night wore on. At last came a
knocking, knocking at the door,  tap!
tap! tap! But he did not hear. A mo-
ment of silence, and again caine a knock-
ing  knocking  knocking!


XLII.

	The white and red flag of Jersey was
flying half-mast from the Cohue Royale,
and the bell of the parish church was
tolling. It was Saturday, but little
business was being done in the Vier
Marchi. At familiar points chattering</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00854" SEQ="0854" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="848">	848	The Battle of the Strong.
people were gathered, and at the foot
of La Pyramide a large group sur-
rounded two sailormen just come from
Gasp6, bringing news of adventuring
Jersiais,  Elie Mattingley, Carterette,
and Ranuiph Delagarde. This audience
quickly grew, for word was being passed
on from one little group to another. So
keen was interest in the story told by
the home-coming sailors that the great
event which had brought them to the
Vier Marchi was, for the moment, al-
most neglected.
	Presently, however, a cannon-shot, then
another, and another, roused the people
to remembrance. The funeral cort6ge of
Admiral Prince Philip dAvranche was
about to leave the Cohue Royale, and
every eye was turned to the marines and
sailors lining the road from the court-
house to the church.
	The Isle of Jersey, ever stubbornly
loyal to its own,  even those whom the
outside world contemned or cast aside, 
jealous of its dignity even with the dead,
had come to bury Philip dAvranche with
all good ceremony. There had been
abatements to his honor, but he had been
a strong man and he had done strong
things, and he was a Jerseyman born,
a Norman of the Normans. The Royal
Court had judged between him and Gui-
da, doing tardy justice to her, but of him
they had ever been proud; and where
conscience condemned here, vanity com-
mended there. In any event, they re-
served the right, independent of all non-
Jersiais, to do what they chose with their
dead.
	For what Philip had been as an ad-
miral they would do his body reverence
now; for what he had done as a man,
that belonged to another tribunal. It
had been proposed by the admiral of
the station to bury him from his old
ship, the Imperturbable; but the Royal
Court had made its claim, and so his
body had lain in state in the Cohue Ro-
yale. The admiral joined hands with the
island authorities. In both eases it was
a dogged loyalty. The sailors of Eng-
land knew Philip dAvranche as a fight-
er, even as the Royal Court knew him
as a famous and dominant Jerseyman.
A battleship is a world of its own, and
Jersey is a world of its own. They
neither knew nor cared for the comment
of the world without; or, knowing, re-
fused to consider it.
	When the body of Philip was carried
from the Cohue Royale, signals were
made to the Imperturbable in the tide-
way. From all her ships in company
forty guns were fired funeral-wise, and
the flags were struck half-mast.
	Slowly the cort6ge uncoiled itself to
one long, unbroken line from the steps
of the Cohue Royale to the porch of the
church. The jurats in their red robes,
the officers, sailors, and marines added
color to the pageant. The coffin was cov-
ered by the flag of Jersey with the arms
of William the Conqueror in the canton.
	Of the crowd, some were curious, some
stoical; some wept, some essayed philo-
sophy.
	Et ben, said one, he was a brave
admiral!
	Bravery was his trade, answered
another: act like a sheep and you 11
be eaten by the wolf.
	It was a bad business about her that
was Guida Landresse, remarked a third.
	Every man knows himself; God
knows all men, snuffled the fanatical
barber who had once delivered a sermon
from the Pompe des Brigands.
	He made things lively while he
lived, b~ sft! droned the jailer of the
Vier Prison. But he has folded sails
now, pergui!
	Ma f 6, yes, he sleeps like a porpoise
now; and white as a wax he looked up
there in the Cohue Royale, put in a cen-
tenier standing by.
	A voice came shrilly over the head of
the centenier: As white as you 11 look
yellow one day, bat dla goule! Yel-
low and green, oni-gia !  yellow like
a bad apple, and cowardly green as a</PB>

leek. This was Manon Moignard, the
witch.
	Mon doux dla vie, where s the
master of burials? babbled the jailer.
The apprentice does the obsquies to-
day.
	The master s sick of a squinzy,
grunted the centenier. So hatchet-face
and bundle-o-nails there brings dust to
dust, amen.
	All turned now to the undertakers
apprentice, a grim, saturnine figure with
his gray face, protuberant eyes, and ob-
sequious solemnity, in which lurked a
callous smile. The burial of the great,
the execution of the wicked, were alike
to him. In him Fate seemed to per-
sonify lifes revenges, its futilities, its
calculating ironies.
	The flag-draped coffin was just about
to pass, and the fanatical barber harked
back to Philip. They say it was all
empty honors with him afore he died
abroad.
	A full belly s a full belly, if it s
only full of straw! snapped Manon
Moignard.
	Who was it brought him home?
asked the jailer.
	None that was born on Jersey, but
two that lived here, remarked Maitre
Damian, the schoolmaster from St. Au-
bins.
	That Chevalier of Cbampsavoys and
the other Duc de Bercy, interposed the
centenier.
	Maitre Damian tapped his stick upon
the ground, and said oracularly, It is
not for me to say, but which is the right-
ful duke, and which is not,  there is the
political question!
	Pardi, that s it! answered the
centenier. Why did D6tricand Duke
turn Philip Duke out of duchy, see him
killed, then fetch him home to Jersey
like a brother? Ah, man p~the b~nin,
that s beyond me!
	Those great folks does things their
own ways, oni-gia! remarked the jailer.
	Why did D~tricand Duke go back
	VOL LXXXII. -~- NO. 494.	54
to France? asked Maitre Damian,
cocking his head wisely. Why did he
not stay for obsequies  he?
	That s what I say, answered the
jailer: ~those great folks does things
their own ways.
	Ma fistre, I believe you! ejacu-
lated the centenier. But for the che-
valier there, for a Frenchman, that is a
man after Gods own heart, and mine.
	Ah, then, look at that! said Manon
Moignard, with a sneer; when one
pleases you and God, it is a ticket to
heaven, diantre!
	But in truth what Detricand and the
chevalier had done was but of human
pity. The day after the duel D6tricand
had arrived in Paris, to proceed thence
to Bercy. There he heard of Philips
death and of Damours desertion. Send-
ing officers to Bercy to frustrate any
possible designs of Damour, he, with
the chevalier, took Philips body back to
Jersey, delivering it to those who would
do it honor.
	D~tricand did not see Guida. For
all that might be said to her now the
chevalier should be his mouthpiece. In
truth, there could be no better mouth-
piece for him. It was D6tricand, D6tri-
cand, DStricand, like a child, in admira-
tion and in affection. If Guida did not
understand all now, there should come a
time when she would understand. D6-
tricand would wait. She should find
that he was just; that her honor and the
honor of her child were safe with him.
	As for Guida, it was not grief she
felt in the presence of this tragedy. No
spark of love sprang up, even when re-
membrance was now brought to its last
vital moment. But a fathomless pity
stirred her heart, that Philips life had
been so futile, and that all he had done
was come to naught. His letter, blotched
and blotted by his own dead cheek, she
read quietly. Yet her heart ached bit-
terly,  so bitterly that her face became
pinched with pain; for here in this let-
ter was despair, here was the final agony</PB>

of a broken life, here were the last words
of the father of her child to herself. She
saw, with a sudden pang, that in writing
of Guilbert he only said your child, not
ours. What a measureless distance there
was between them in the hour of his
death, and how clearly the letter showed
that he understood at last!
	The evening before the burial she
went with the chevalier to the Cohue
Royale. As she looked at Philips dead
face, bitterness and aching compassion
were quieted within her. The face was
peaceful, strong. There was on it no
record of fret or despair. Its impassive
dignity seemed to say that all accounts
had been settled, and in this finality there
was quiet; as though he had paid the
price; as though the long account against
him in the markets of life was closed and
canceled, and tbe debtor freed from ob-
ligation forever. Poignant impulses in
her stilled, pity lost its wounding acute-
ness. She shed no tears, but at last she
stretched out her hand and let it rest
upon his forehead for a moment.
	Poor Philip! she said.
	Then she turned and slowly left the
room, followed by the chevalier, and by
the noiseless Dormy Jamais, who had
crept in behind them. As Dormy Ja-
mais closed the door he looked back to
where the coffin lay, and in the compas-
sion of fools repeated Guidas words.
	Poor Philip! he said.
	Now, during Philips burial Dormy
Jamais sat upon the roof of the Cohue
Royale, as he had done on the day of
the battle of Jersey, looking down on
the funeral cort6ge and the crowd. He
watched it all until the ruffle of drums at
the grave told that the body was being
lowered,  four ruffles for an admiral.
	As the people began to disperse and
the church bell ceased tolling, Dormy
turned to another bell at his elbow, and
set it ringing to call the Royal Court to-
gether. Sharp, mirthless, and acrid it
rang: Chicane-chicane! Chicctne-chi-
cane. Chicane-ehicane!
XLIII.

	What is that for? asked the child,
pointing.
	D~tricand put the watch to the childs
ear. It s to keep time. Listen. iDo
you hear it,  tic-tic, tie-tic?
	The child nodded his head gleefully,
and his big eyes blinked with under-
standing. Does nt it ever stop? he
asked.
	This watch never stops, replied D6-
tricand, but there are plenty of watches
that do.
	I like watches, said the child sen-
tentiously.
	Would you like this one? asked
D6tricand.
	The child drew in a gurgling breath
of pleasure. I like it. Why does nt
mother have a watch?
	The man did not answer the last ques-
tion. You like it? he said again,
and he nodded his head toward the little
fellow. Hm! it keeps good time, ex-
cellent time it keeps, and he rose to
meet the childs mother, who, having
just entered the room, stood looking at
them. It was Guida. She had heard
the last words, and she glanced toward
the watch curiously.
	D6tricand smiled in greeting, and said
to her, Do you remember it? He
held up the watch.
	She came forward eagerly. Is it 
is it that, indeed, the watch that the dear
grandp~the 
He nodded and smiled. Yes; it has
never once stopped since the moment he
gave it me in the Vier Marchi, seven
years ago. It has had a charmed ex-
istence amid many rough doings and ac-
cidents. I was always afraid of losing
it, always afraid of an accident to it.
It has seemed to me that if I could
keep it things would go right with me,
and would come out right in the end.
Superstition, of course, but I lived a long
time in Jersey. I feel more a Jersey-</PB>

man than a Frenchman sometimes. Al-
though his look seemed to rest but casu-
ally on her face, it was evident he was
anxious to feel the effect of every word
upon her, and he added, When the
Sieur de Mauprat gave me the watch he
said, May no time be ill spent that it
records for you.
	Perhaps he knows his wish was ful-
filled, answered Guida.
	You think, then, that I ye kept my
promise?
	I am sure he would say so, she re-
plied warmly.
	It is nt the promise I made to him
that I mean, but the promise I made to
you.~~
	She smiled brightly. Ah, you know
what I think of that. I told you long
ago. She turned her head away, for
a bright color had come to her cheek.
You have done great things, prince,
she said in a low tone.
	He flashed a look of inquiry at her.
To his ear there was in her voice a lit-
tle touch, not of bitterness, but of some-
thing, as it were, muffled or reserved.
Was she thinking how he had robbed
her child of the chance of heritage at
Bercy? He did not reply, but, stooping,
put the watch again to the childs ear.
There you are, monseigneur!
Why do you call him monseigneur?
she asked. Guilbert has no title to
your compliment.
	A look half amused, half perplexed,
crossed D6tricands face. Do you think
so? he said musingly. Stooping once
more, he said to the child, Would you
like the watch? and added quickly,
You shall have it when you re grown
~
	Do you really mean it? asked
Guida, delighted. Do you really mean
to give him the grandp~thes watch one
day?
	Oh yes, at least that,  one day.
But I have something more, something
more for you, and he drew from his
pocket a miniature set in rubies and dia
monds. I have brought you this from
the Duc de Mauban,  and this, he
went on, taking a letter from his pocket,
and handing it with the gift. The duke
thought you might care to have it. It is
the face of your godmother, the Duchess
Guidabaldine.
	Guida looked at the miniature earnest-
ly, and then said a little wistfully, How
beautiful a face  but the jewels are
much too fine for me. What should one
do here with rubies and diamonds? How
can I thank the duke!
	Not so. He will thank you for ac-
cepting it. He begged me to say  as
you will find by his letter to you  that
if you will but go to him upon a visit
with this great man here, pointing to
the child with a smile, he will count it
one of the greatest pleasures of his life.
He is too old to come to you, but he begs
you to go to him,  the chevalier, and
you, and Guilbert. He is much alone
now, and he longs for a little of that
friendship which can be given by but few
in this world. He counts upon your com-
ing, for I said I thought you would.
	It would seem so strange, she an-
swered, to go from this cottage of my
childhood, to which I have come back
in peace at last,  from this kitchen to
the chateau of the Due de Mauban.
	But it was sure to come, he re-
turned. This kitchen, to which I come
also to redeem my pledge after seven
years, it belongs to one part of your life.
But there is another part to fulfill, 
he passed his hands over the curls of the
child,  and for your child here you
should do it.
	I do not find your meaning, she
said, after a moments deliberation. I
do not know what you would have me
understand.
	In some ways you and I would be
happier in simple surroundings, here-
plied gravely, but it would seem that,
to play duly our part in the world, we
must needs move in wider circles. To
my mind this kitchen is the most de</PB>

lightful spot in the world. Here I took
a fresh commission of life. I went out,
a sort of battered remnant, to a forlorn
hope ; and now I come back to headquar-
ters once again,  not to be praised,
he added in an ironical tone, and with a
quick gesture of almost boyish shyness,
 not to be praised; only to show that
from a grain of decency left in a man
may grow up some sheaves of honest
work and plain duty.
	Oh, it is much more than that, 
it is much, much more than that! she
broke in.
No, I am afraid it is not; but that is
not what I wished to say. I wished to
say that for monseigneur here 
A little flash of anger came into her
eyes. He is no monseigneur; he is
Guilbert dAvranche, she said bitterly.
It is not like you to mock my child,
prince. Oh, I know you mean it play-
fully, she hurriedly added, but  but
it does not sound right to me.
	For the sake of monseigneur the
heir to the duchy of Bercy, he said,
laying his hand upon the childs head,
these things your devoted friends sug-
gest you should do, princess.
	Her clear, unwavering eye looked
steadfastly at him, but her face turned
pale. Why do you call him monsel-
gneur the heir to the duchy of Bercy?
she said almost coldly, and with a little
fear in her look, too.
	Because I have come here to tell
you the truth, and to place in your hands
the record of an act of justice.
	Drawing from his pocket a parchment
gorgeous with seals, h~ stooped, and
taking the hands of the child he placed
it in them. Hold it tight, hold it tight,
my little friend, for it is your very own,
he said, with cheerful kindliness. Then
stepping back a little, and looking ear-
nestly at Guida, he continued, with a mo-
tion of ~he hand toward Guilbert, You
must learn the truth from him.
	Oh, what can you mean,  what can
you mean! she exclaimed. Dropping
upon her knees, and running an arm
round the child, she opened the parch-
ment and read.
	What  what right has he to this?
she cried in a voice of dismay. A
year ago you dispossessed his father from
the duchy. Ah, I do not understand it!
You  only you are the Duc de Bercy.
	Her eyes were shining with a happy
excitement ana tenderness. No such
look had been in them for many a day.
Something that had long slept was wak-
ing in her, something long voiceless was
speaking. This man brought back to her
heart a glow she had thought never to
feel again,  the glow of the wonder of
life and of a girlish faith.
	I am only D6tricand of Vaufon-
tame, he answered. What! did you
 could you think that I would dispos-
sess your child? His father was the
adopted son of the Duc de Bercy; no-
thing could wipe that out, neither law
nor nations. You are always Princess
Guida, and your child is always Prince
Guilbert dAvranche,  and more than
that.
	His voice became lower; his war-beat-
en face lighted with that fire and force
which had made him, during years past,
a figure in the war records of Europe.
	I unseated Philip dAvranche, he
continued, because he acquired the
duchy through  a misapprehension;
because the claims of the house of Vau-
fontaine were greater. We belonged;
he was an alien. He had a right to
his adoption; he had no right to his
duchy,  no real right in the equity
of nations. But all the time I never
forgot that the wife of Philip dAvranche
and her child had rights infinitely be-
yond his own. All that he achieved was
theirs by every principle of justice.
My plain duty was to win for your child
the succession belonging to him by all
moral right. When Philip dAvranche
was killed, I set to work to do for your
child what had been done by another
for Philip dAvranche. I have made</PB>

him my heir. When he is of age, I
shall abdicate from the duchy in his fa-
vor. This deed, countersigned by the
Powers that dispossessed his father, se-
cures to him the duchy, when he is old
enough to govern.
	Guida had listened like one in a
dream. A hundred feelings possessed
her, and one more than all. She sud-
denly saw all D&#38; ricands goodness to
her stretch out in a long line of devoted
friendship, from this day to that far-off
hour, seven years before, when he had
made a vow to her,  kept how nobly!
Devoted friendship,  was it devoted
friendship alone, even with herself? In
a tumult of emotions she exclaimed, No,
no, no, no! I cannot accept it. This is
not justice; this is a gift for which there
is no example in the worlds history!
	I thought it best, he went on qui-
etly, to govern Bercy myself during
these troubled years. So far its neu-
trality has been honored, but who can
tell what may come? As a Vaufontaine,
it is my duty to see that Bercys inter-
ests are duly protected amidst the trou-
bles of Europe.
	Guida got to her feet now, and stood
looking dazedly at the parchment in her
hand. The child, feeling himself neg-
lected, ran out into the garden.
	There was moisture in Guidas eyes as
she presently said, I had not thought
that any man could be so noble,  no,
not even you.~~
	You should not doubt yourself so,
he answered meaningly. I am the
work of your hands. If I have fought
my way back to reputable life again 
He paused, and took from his pocket
a handkerchief. This was the gage,
he said, holding it up. Do you re-
member the day I came to return it to
you, and carried it off again?
	It was foolish of you to keep it, she
said softly,  as foolish of you as to
think that I shall accept for my child
these great honors.~~
	But suppose the child in after years
should blame you? he returned slowly
and with emphasis. Suppose that Guil-
bert should say, What right had you, my
mother, to refuse what was my due?
	This was the question she had asked
herself long, long ago. It smote her
heart now. What right had she to reject
this gift of Fate to her child?
	Scarcely above a whisper she replied,
Of course he might say that; but how,
oh, how should we simple folk, he and
I, be fitted for these high places  yet?
Now that what I have desired for him
has come, I have not the courage.
	You have friends to help you in all
you do, he remarked meaningly.
	But friends cannot always be with
one, she said.
	That depends upon the friends.
There is one friend of yours who has
known you for eighteen years. Eighteen
years growth should make a strong
friendship,  there was always friend-
ship on his part, at least. He can be a
still stronger and better friend. He
comes now to offer you the remainder
of a life for which your own goodness is
the guarantee. He comes to offer you
a love of which your own soul must be
the only judge, for you have eyes that
see and a spirit that knows. The che-
valier needs you and the Due de Mauban
needs you, but D~tricand of Vaufontaine
needs you a thousand times more.
	Oh, hush  but no, you must not,
she broke in, her face all crimson, her
lips trembling.
	But yes, I must, he answered
quickly. You find peace here, but it
is the peace of inaction. It dulls the
brain, and life winds in upon itself wea-
rily at the last. But out there are light
and fire and action, and the quick-beat-
ing pulse, and the joy of power wisely
used, even to the end. You come of a
great people, you were born to great
things; your child has rights accorded
now by every court of Europe. You
must act for him. For your childs
sake, for my sake, come out into the</PB>

great field of life with me  as my wife,
Guida.
	She turned to him frankly, she looked
at him steadfastly; the color in her face
came and went, but her eyes glowed with
feeling.
	After all that has happened? she
asked in a low tone.
	It could only be because of all that
has happened.
	No, no, you do not understand, she
said quickly, a great pain in her voice.
I have suffered so, these many, many
years. I shall never be light - hearted
again. And I am not fitted for such
high estate. Do you not see what you
ask of me,  to go from this cottage to
a palace?
I love you too well to ask you to do
what you could not. You must trust
me, he answered, you must give your
life its chance, you must  
But listen to me, she interjected,
with breaking tones. I know as surely
as I know  as I know the face of my
child, that the youth in me is dead. My
summer came  and went  long ago.
No, no, you do not understand,  I
would not make you unhappy. I must
live only to make my child happy. That
love has not been marred!
And I must be judge of what is for
my own happiness. And for yours, 
if I thought my love would make you
unhappy for even one day, I should not
offer it. I am your lover, but I am also
your friend. Had it not been for you,
I might have slept in a drunkards grave
in Jersey. Were it not for you, my
bones would now be lying in the Vend6e.
I left my peasants, I denied myself death
with them, to serve you. The old cause
is gone. You and your child are now
my only cause 
You make it so hard for me! she
broke in. Think of the shadows from
the past always in my eyes, always in
my heart. You cannot wear the con-
victs chain without the lagging footstep
afterward.
	Shadows! Friend of my soul, how
should I dare come to you if there had
never been shadows in your life! It is
because you  you have suffered, be-
cause you know, that I come. Out of
your miseries, the convicts lagging step,
you say? Think what I was. There
was never any wrong in you, but I was
sunk in evil depths of folly 
I will not have you say so, she in-
terrupted; you never in your life did
a dishonorable thing.
Then again I say, trust me; for, on
the honor of a Yanfontaine, I believe
that happiness will be yours as my wife.
The boy,  you see how he and I 
Ah, you are so good to him!
	You must give me chance and right
to serve him. What else have you or I
to look forward to? The honors of this
world concern us little. The brightest
joys are not for us. We have work be-
fore us, no rainbow ambitions. But the
boy  think for him  He paused.
	After a little she held out her hand to-
ward him. Good-by, she said softly.
	Good-by  you say good-by to me!
he exclaimed in dismay.
	Till  till to - morrow, she an-
swered, and she smiled. The smile had
a little touch of the old archness which
was hers as a child, yet, too, a little of
the sadness belonging to the woman.
But her hand-clasp was firm and strong,
and her touch thrilled him. Power was
there,  power with infinite gentleness.
And he understood her, which was more
than all.
	He turned at the door She was stand-
ing very still, the parchment with the
great seals in her hand. Without speak-
ing she held it out to him, as though un-
certain what to do with it.
	As he passed through the doorway he
smiled, and said, To - morrow,  to-
morrow!

OLD HOMES.

OLD homes among the hills! I love their gardens;
Their old rock-fences that our day inherits;
Their doors, round which the great trees stand like wardens;
Their paths, down which the shadows march like spirits;
Broad doors and paths that reach bird-haunted gardens.

I see them gray among their ancient acres,
	Severe of front, their gables lichen-sprinkled, 
Like gentle-hearted, solitary Quakers,
	Grave and religious, with kind faces wrinkled, 
Serene among their memory-hallowed acres.

Their gardens, banked with roses and with lilies, 
Those sweet aristocrats of all the flowers, 
Where Springtime mints her gold in daffodillies,
And Autumn ingots marigolds in showers,
And all the hours are toilless as the lilies.

I love their orchards, where the gay woodpecker
Flits, flashing oer you, like a wing~d jewel;
Their woods, whose floors of moss the squirrels checker
With half-hulled nuts; and where, in cool renewal,
The wild brooks laugh, and raps the red woodpecker.

Old homes! old hearts! Upon my soul forever
Their peace and gladness lie like tears and laughter;
Like love, they touch me, through the years that sever,
With simple faith; like friendship, draw me after
The dreamy patience that is theirs forever.

Though the high tide of clover was astir,
And blue-eyed flowers leaned across the grass
To see it pass,
And the long, rippled tresses
Of watercresses
Were misted with thin crystal, under stream, 
For more content
To small suspected presences, agleam,
And then away!  yet, ever diligent,
Untamed, soft fluttering,
The little creature went on rapturous wing,
Loyal and changeful, feathered, yet at rest,
On its own quest,
Subtle as light and simple as a nest.
It mused among the shaggy weeds and bubbled
In broken paths, untroubled;
With such a tongue to comfort and beseech,
It won the stones to speech!
Long time I listened, pondered, with love-looks,
The ways of brooks;
When, feeling, half aware,
The benediction-touch upon my hair,
Of something fair,
I turned from that wise water happy-voiced;
And there,
Against the flush of waning afternoon,
Early, a dim moth-silver, poised
The Moon.

system, which we will make bold to call
the feminine, as opposed to the stolid
masculine practice of beginning at the
beginning and ending at the end, is one
of the great economic inventions of this
ingenious age.
	But, unfortunately, the value of the
system is negative. It prevents a shock-
ing waste of time upon uncongenial
books; yet if, by some happy accident,
the volume is congenial, when once the
solution is known, the bubble of interest
is pricked.
	For my own part, I follow the simpler
method; but recognizing that the value
of the feminine system is too evident to
be lightly cast aside, I submit with some
diffidence a few simple rules for the
guidance of discriminating readers.
	(1.) New books in paper covers should
be read after the feminine system.
	(2.) When a brand-new author issues
a brand-new book, the feminine method
is very safe.
	(3.) When the newspapers hail the
author as the Thackeray of the United
States, the Balzac of America, or the
Fielding of the nineteenth century, the
feminine system should be rigorously
followed.
	(4.) Wheu a novel is suspected of a
purpose, apply the system and dis-
cover the purpose.
	If these directions be scrupulously
followed, it is my confident belief that
I shall deserve the lasting gratitude of
every reader who would save time, trou-
ble, and vexation of spirit.
	Thus I admit the typical last chapter
has its legitimate use. But surely it
is not for this that authors add their
smooth explanation of the past, their
elaborate horoscope of the future, their
public scrutiny into lives that have
passed beyond the limits of their story.
Their purpose is to gratify the people,
not to do honor to their craft. As the
component part of a work of art, the
weakness of the traditional last chapter
is but too evident. When once we have
reached the climax, we are straightway
tempted to close the book. There the
story ends. The curtain drops. Gold
and tinsel vanish. The actors become
men and women much like the rest of
us. To describe them further is mere
gossip.
	Many a successful author knows this
in his heart. But if, regardless of his
readers curiosity, he carefully omit the
closing sketch of a paternal hero and a
domesticated heroine, then Give us a
sequel ! is at once the cry. With half-
assumed reluctance, the complacent au-
thor yields. In due time the sequel is
brought forth. Everybody reads it. The
Sunday newspapers predict undying
fame. The original is surpassed, they
say, the author has outdone himself. A
year later the very title is on the verge
of oblivion. Indeed, the failure of the
sequel is proverbial, for David Balfour
and the romances of Dumas merely serve
to prove the rule.
	But, most commonly, the author holds
nothing back, and the last chapter is
given to the reader in all its relentless
accuracy. Let us take a few familiar
examples. It is, for instance, to a last
chapter that we owe the description of
Daniel Derondas wedding in the very
heart of Jewry, and willy-nilly we must
read of Mira glowing like a dark tipped
yet delicate ivory-tinted flower in the
warm sunlight of success. What in
the name of satiety is the need of this!
one exclaims involuntarily. But here the
reader will say that Jam prejudiced; that
my thoughts are fixed on Gwendolen;
that I never really appreciated Mira;
that this last vignette of the sentimental
Jewess, surrounded by the whole Cohen
family, makes me needlessly intolerant.
Lest these charges be thought too plausi-
ble, I will adduce a fairer instance.
	The conclusion of Jane Eyre purports
to be written by the heroine ten years
after her marriage with Rochester.
What has she to tell us? I know no
weariness of my Edwards society. .</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00864" SEQ="0864" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="858">	858	The Contributors club.
We talk, I believe, all day. (Bless us,
of course they did, or she had not been
Jane Eyre nor he Rochester.) Diana
and Mary Rivers are both married.
(We guessed as much.) My Edward
is no longer stone blind. (Here, it is
true, is news, but might it not have been
hinted to us before?)
	Even Hawthorne, who was not wont
to swerve from literary ideals, was badg-
ered by public curiosity into some re-
luctant explanations. The Marble Faun,
I believe, originally ended with the
famous scene in the Pantheon where be-
neath the eye of Heaven Kenyon and
Hilda plight their lovers oaths. Here
was the natural and therefore the artis-
tic ending; but the public cried out, and
half a chapter was added. Hildas for-
mer disappearance is explained. Poor
Donatellos fate is hinted at. But, still
insatiate, the reader clamors for the se-
cret of the Faun. How would Cuvier
classify Donatello? he demands. This
is too much. At last the long-suffering
author protests: On that point, at all
events, there shall be no word of expla-
nation, and his promise is well kept.
	One half of this apparent curiosity is
in reality pure laziness. Like children
who turn to the appendix for the answer
before they do a problem, readers grudge
the smallest claims upon their intellect
or fancy. They do not read, they say,
for mental exercise, but for pleasure.
Print is plainer and more satisfactory
than speculation. It is the authors busi-
ness to write the story, and a good work-
man makes his work complete. Why
should a reader, buried in the easiest of
chairs, and fortified against discomfort
by dressing-gown and slippers, be obliged
to cudgel the brain and start the ima-
gination from quiescence, when the au-
thor can save the trouble in no time? A
pest upon The Lady or the Tiger! A
plague on the ears of the Faun! Bet-
ter a thousand times crop them short
than leave them hidden in this everlast-
ing doubt.
	Yet, to my thinking, it is just here that
a chief duty of the author lies. He owes
it to the reader to develop qualities which
the world too often leaves untouched.
Not business nor golf, not housekeeping
nor driving, will stir the imagination;
yet if it lie fallow, how much is gone
from life! Once roused, the fancy feeds
on its own growth, until it colors the
world and softens the hardness of every
outline. The last chapter opens a wide
opportunity. In it, if the author will,
he may lead the reader to the border-
land of fact and fancy, and thence let
him stray unaided. The first step taken,
the exercise becomes a pleasure. The
reader closes the book, but his thoughts
run on and on, and in his mild way he
shares the keen delight of a creative
mind.
	It is a hopeful sign of the times that
many novelists of to-day have self-con-
trol enough to halt when their story is
told. But, unhappily, their whole task
is not accomplished thus. A dull story
with the best of endings is but a crime
without aggravating circumstance. To
the vulgar author, the opportunity of the
last chapter is denied. Long since, the
readers attention has flagged hopelessly,
and pricked as it may be, at the close,
it will not budge one inch beyond the
pale marked by the blessed Finis.
Again the mind becomes a peaceful
blank.
	I know no more perfect master of the
art of effect in a last chapter than the
Russian Turgueneff. When the acme of
interest is past, he never runs on in gar-
rulous anti-climax, sparing the imagina-
tion every effort; nor does he drop a
curtain behind which it is impossible to
grope. The few pages which end his
novels, like the mists that wrap a distant
landscape, vaguely suggest the unknown
scenes beyond. If some incident subse-
quent to the story is necessary to com-
plete our understanding of a character,
 as for instance the death of Dmitri
Rudin~  he gives it to us briefly, yet</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00865" SEQ="0865" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="859">	The Contributors club.	859

without reserve. But if the details we
seek are the mere sequel of the plot, we
find them hedged about with tantalizing
doubt. What reader, as he finishes the
wonderful story of Helene, does not pause
while his mind follows her from Venice
upon her unknown journey? And who
is insensible to the fascination of the
thought that her fate may be divined by
him alone?
	For such an ending to such a story
the reader may well feel grateful. Crea-
tions like this are rare, as they are pre-
cious. Their authors are fewer still, but
they are born to immortality.
	IN 1862, when President Lincoln is-

The Two sued his second call for
Stages of a troops, a certain young man
Hero. quitted the gold fields of Col-
orado, and hastened across the plains to
Omaha as fast as the enduring ox-teams
of the time could carry him. There he
took a train for Michigan, the state of
his residence; stopped at Kalamazoo to
marry his sweetheart, and to deliver to
her his belt of gold dust; and then sped
on to the recruiting station at Detroit.
He enlisted in the ranks, went to the
front, fought in no less than seven of the
historic battles, incurred serious physical
troubles, was wounded, and in the third
year of the war was discharged and sent
home a lieutenant of his company. This
man, still in the prime of life, sitting
under his own vine and apple tree, heard
of the recent war with irritation.
	Why cant we have peace ? he
asked. What is all this trouble about,
anyway? Whats all this talk about
civilization, if men must fall at one an-
others throats? As for these young
boys who are enlisting, they 11 be crying
for their mothers. Why, Bill Brown
left his father, now getting to be an old
man, to look after the farm alone this
summer. Bill d no business to go off.
The best way for him to serve his coun-
try is by staying at home and getting
in the crops. And Conover, who was
clerking for Sisson, he s gone too, and
has nt been married but a month. Why
cant he stay at home and take care of
his wife? She 11 be a widow, the first
thing she knows! It s a very strange
thing to me that men cant attend to their
business, and get over the habit of kill-
ing one another.
	While there are many exceptions to the
rule, this lament of the civil-war veteran
is that of many of his class. They re-
present what may be termed the subjec-
tivity of the spontaneous patriot. They
are not men accustomed to viewing his-
torical events in an objective way, and
they are interested in the course of things
chiefly as it affects themselves. It is
an open question whether such men as
Bill Brown, and Conover, and the vet-
eran as he was in his youth (for tbey
are all of the same class) are not of
more use to a commonwealth than men
of reflection. At any rate, they make
up the ranks; they do the work in the
fields, in the shops, in the trenches, in
the churches; they comprise the great
majority of this enormous, heterogene-
ous nation. But what distinguishes them
most from the men of reflection is the
fact that they unconsciously obey the
laws of nature. When they are young,
they are young. When they are old,
they are old. They have a time for
seeking the bubble reputation at the
cannons mouth, and a time for the lean
and slippered pantaloon; nor do they
feel impelled to accept sentiments in-
consistent with their time of life, nor to
affect a state of mind they do not feel.
This simple obedience to the course of
nature makes many of the heroes of our
past generation intolerant of those of to-
day. Years have softened them; their
aggressive masculinity is a thing of the
past,  all the more because they once
put it to the test, and expressed them-
selves passionately in the most strenuous
conflict of the world; having satisfied
themselves, their women, and their friends
of their manhood in this most conclusive
way, they rest content with peace. They</PB>

forget that the present generation has a
right to its drama; that the young wo-
men want their heroes, and the old wo-
men wish to see their sons distinguish
themselves; and that deep in the souls
even of young men half drugged by
commercial monotony is a dream of
prowess, a desire for adventure, and an
impatience for some form of intense per-
sonal expression.
	This histrionic self-expression the pre-
sent generation has now had. It has
idealized itself for its own delight, and
is able to regard itself poetically. Now
it, too, is ready to move on to unimpas-
sioned work and prudent living.
	I HAVE often wondered why some one
scorning has not taken issue with
?r~~ Shakespeare on his dogmatic
turn. command, Let still the wo-
man take an elder than herself. The
frequent marriages of women to men
younger than themselves have been sin-
gularly happy and congenial, from Dr.
Johnson~ s marriage with his dear Tet-
zey, who was twice his age, to Yarn-
liagen von Ense and Madame Mohi. In
Napoleons marriage the age of Jose-
phine did not matter. When Madame
de Stad turned to her young husband,
Rocca, one must feel that she brought to
him more than Chloe offered Daphnis;
and when George Eliot married Mr.
Cross, must we not believe that the union
was one of dignified significance?
	Hear what Yarnhagen says in his
journal before his marriage with Rahel
Levin, the woman whose merit has been
attested by Goethe, Jean Paul Richter,
and Carlyle: I was then twenty-four
years old, Rahel my senior by more than
half those years. This circumstance taken
by itself might seem likely to have
driven our lives far asunder. It was,
however, but an accident; it was essen-
tially of no account. This noble life, so
rich in experience both of joy and of sor-
row, retained all its vigor; not only the
powerful intellect which hovered above
every - day regions, but the heart, the
senses, the whole corporeal being, were
as though bathed in clear light. She
stood a commanding presence between
an accomplished past and a hopeful fu-
ture.
	To whom do we owe so high an inter-
pretation of the ideal of marriage as to
Charles Kingsley, whose wife was seven
years his senior? Turn the pages of
his Life and re-read these words: Mat-
thew xxii. 30 has been to me always a
comfort. I am so well and really mar-
ried on earth that I should be exceeding-
ly sorry to be married again in heaven;
and it would be very needless. All I can
say is, if I do not love my wife, body and
soul, as well there as I do here, then
there is neither resurrection of my body
nor of my soul, but of some other, and
I shall not be I.
	It is interesting to recall the heroines
of Disraeli,  Henrietta Temple and
others,  and then to remember that
Disraeli defied the theory of feminine
attraction which he had advanced in fic-
tion, by selecting for his wife a woman
who was much older than himself, and to
whom he attributed the success as well as
the happiness of his life. The story runs
that once, seeing his wife, then aged and
frail, leaning on the arm of an attend-
ant, Lord Beaconsfield said of her to the
friend with whom he was at the mo-
inent talking, There is the only person
who has never bored me.
	Those beautiful love poems, At the
Fireside and One Word More, were writ-
ten by Robert Browning to his wife,
who was six years his senior. Robert
Louis Stevenson~ s marriage with Mrs.
Osborne, who was much older than he,
was, as we all know, a union of extraor-
dinary felicity. His own words in the
poem which serves as the dedication to
Weir of Hermiston, as well as the tes-
timony of his friends, attribute to her
much help in his literary success, as well
as his domestic happiness.</PB>

(t)	The picturesque story of the Rough
Riders, from the inception of the original idea to
the mustering out of the famous regiment, is to
he told, beginning in January, and occupying six
numbers. The organizer and commander of the
re iment was already well known as a depicter of
picturesque adventures before he became famous
as a soldier.
This will stand as the authoritative history of
his regiment as a fighting machine, as well as
being a vivid narrative, with numerous anec-
dotes, showing the individual bravery of his
men. He was personally acquainted with num-
bers of them, both plainsmen and city - bred
riders. There will be individual sketches of many
of these, together with photographs taken, under
the supervision of Col. Roosevelt, by Dwight L.
Elmendorf and other expert photographers.

telling of the preparation of the navy (in which
as Assistant Secretary of the Navy he took an ac-

his American friends. No one of modern times had
more literary friends than Stevenson. 1 hese not-
able letters cover the significant years and events
of his life. Their publication will begin in Janu-

he tells of their inner workings and of some of the
little things that change the destinies of nations.

of Blame; in another he repeats verbatim certain
memorable conversations with Grant.

ST. NICHOLAS
FOR YOUNG FOLKS.
Edited by Mary Mapes Dodge.
BEGINNING
THE TWENTY-SIXTH YEAR.
PERHAPS you used to read ST. NICHOLAS
in its early days. Do you remember how
you enjoyed it, how you looked forward with
eagerness to the day of issue? Twenty-five
years have gone by since the first number ap-
peared in November, 1873, but the magazine
	ST. NICHOLAS OR YOUR LIFE! is to-day just what it was then,
The Best Periodical in the World for ~iirls and Boys.
It has the same editor, Mary Mapes Dodge, and the same policy, to get the best
things in literature and art that money can buy and young folks will enjoy and
thrive under.
	Young people to-day like to read the Henty books, so Mr. Henty has written
for them a story of American history which will appear as a serial in ST. NICHOLAS
for the coming year; and Mrs. Amelia E. Barr, author of Jan Vedders Wife,
will furnish a historical romance of Old New York; and Mrs. Laura E. Richards will
contribute a serial; and there are to be good things from many writersMrs. Burton
Harrison, Lient. Robert E. Peary, Lloyd Osbourne, Mrs. Charles D. Sigsbee (the
wife of the Maines commander), Poultney Bigelow, and others. GeLett Burgess is
to contribute a series of remarkable pictures and verse about the Goop Babies.
Every number of ST. NICHOLAS will be as good as can be made.
	Keep in mind the fact that the young ____________________________________
people of to-day are just as anxious to
read ST. NICHOLAS as you used to be,	~bC ~tcnttii~ ~o.
and how many of them can you subscribe ~ of

The Blessed Damozel.
By DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI. Edited by Wil

This beautiful new edition contains the following
distinctive features: The text is that of the earli-
est printed version, as issued in the rare periodi-
cal, The Gem, afterwards An and Ree-Iry, and
consequently presents the poem in a form hitherto
practically inaccessible. The frontispiece, by per-
mission of Mr. Frederick Hollyer, is a reproduc-
tion of Dante Gabriel Rossettis crayon study of
the head of the Blessed Damozel.

Each verse is enclosed in a designed border, drawn
by Mr. W. B. Macdougall, who has also designed
tIle cover.

HASSAN, A ROMANCE OF PALESTINE

By HENRY GILLMAN
Crown Svo, cloth, extra, $2.00.
Mr. Gillmans powerful romance of the Holy Land as it is to-day is universally praised.
It is the result of careful observation of the Fellaheen of Palestine. The hero of Hassan,
says the New York Times, will be a revelation even to those who carry their ethnolo-
gical studies beyond the realm of fiction.~~

	From The Zndeslendent.  A Bihlical, patriarchal, pastoral spirit pervades it. Indeed, the whole hook is saturated
with the authors reverence for the Holy Land, its lenends, traditions, glory, misery,  its romance, in a word,  and
its one supreme glory, the impress of the Chosen of God and of the Master who walked among them.
	Front The Art Interchange. One feels that he has gained a wide knowledge of the customs, life, and condition
of modern Palestine that could only he otherwise had hy a long residence in the country. The book is one thai seems
destined to bake ho/d of/he toAnlar heart as strongly as did Ben Hur or Quo Vadis, nor is it less worthy of
such potularisy than either of those named.

valuable owing to the facilities which Mr. Lodge has
for obtaining information from his position as United
States Senator and Member of the Foreign Relations	D. HO~\EILS
Committee.


their Silver-Wedding Journey By WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS
~	will be an important serial story extending through many months. The story is an account ~i
of Europe revisited after twenty-five years, enlivened by a characteristic love theme.
~$ Important contributions on particular subjects connected with the war will be strong
features of the earlier numbers of the year. Some of these may be especially mentioned

HISTORY OF THE
To READERS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY:

	We make the following proposition to become members
of the Review of Reviews History Club and obtain the
three volumes of

OUR WAR IN TWO HEMISPHERES
By ALBERT SHAW, Editor of the American Monthly Re-
view of Reviews, and author of Municipal Govern-
ment in Great Britain, etc.

The Standard Reference History
MILES	177 VERY American citizen possessing a library, and
LL~ many that do not possess one, will be interested in
	the announcement of the history of the late war with
Spain, now published by the Review of Reviews Co.
Much of the narrative was written by Dr. Albert Shaw
during the actual fighting of the summer. This has been
revised and amplified by him in the light of the official
reports and documents which have only become available
after hostilities ceased. A free quotation from the critical
Congressional debates, and other public utterances at cru-
cial periods, aids in making this work what it is, the stan-
SHAFTER dard reference history of this decisive and successful
struggle. But it is much more than a lively and compre-
hensive narrative. It goes back to the years of struggle
in Cuba which prepared the way for the war; it discusses
energetically the problems which confronted the United
States after the war as to the Philippines, Cuba, and Porto
Rico; and as a whole it forms a broadly conceived pic-
ture of the year which has seen America brought face to
face with new world-duties.
Chapters by Experts
	The important special and technical matters of the war
MONTOJO period, generally dismissed by the historian with only
slight and often insufficient discussion, are fully and
authentically dealt with in contributed chapters, written
by men who had unusual opportunities for studying their
subjects. Thus, the lessons which the war has for us as
to the relative efficiency of rifles and machine guns are in
a carefully written chapter by Lieut. John H. Parker, of
the United States Army. The military movements of the
Santiago and Porto Rican campaigns are analyzed by the
Editor of the Army aiid Navy Journal; the battle with
Cervera is described by the novelist, Winston Churchill,
who is a graduate of the U. S. Naval Academy; the actual
LONG	condition of Cuba before the war and the facts which
caused the war are described by eye-witnesses, Murat
Halstead and Stephen Bonsal.

SPANISH WAR
Over Half a Thousand Illustrations

	The illustration of the book is especially valuable in the
hundreds of portraits, pictures of the navies, photographed
scenes of the war, and the entertaining cartoons reproduced
from Spanish, French, German, and English papers, as well
as from the American. Some of the Spanish cartoons are
fascinating, aside from their intrinsic humor, in their curi-
ous perversion of the actual conditions, and are valuable
contributions to history in their graphic explanation of the
fatuity which led to Spains overthrow.

mate, her wild ways gradually disappear. When use re-
turns home, her father finds, instead of Isis wild, wilful

the neighboring islands. The old man is quite a busy per-
son, yet he finds time between contracts to answer many
questions of the khsd that any small boy would ask, and to
volunteer a lot of information on the why and wherefore of
dreaming, and discloses wonders that never were dreamed
of in our philosophy, to say nothing of our boys. He is a
reminiscent old chap, too, and some of his stories of dream-
making for the Pilgrim Fathers and Christopher Columbus
and for King Alfred of England, whom he served with an
experimental dream that caused the experimenter to be ban-
ished to the New World, are quite unnatural enough to
startle readers of all ages.

~HE PRE~SIDENTS
A History of the











Written by Our Presidents
edited by the
Hon.JAMES D. RICHARDSON,
Under the Direction of Congress.

Xc the American CitizenThe Father
of the Future and Greater American:

	In this Holiday season, when the whole
nation is rejoicing over the outcome of the

recent stirring events of our history, and congratulating itself on the final settlement in accordance
with the American idea, it is well to think of the citizen that is to be, as well of him who is. Your
boy should have a holiday gift to remind him for all time to come of what the American citizen of
1898 is, and what will be expected of the greater American citizen that is to be.
	The great questions which confront us today are simple in comparison with those which will
come up for solution, and the precedents of our past history are the guide posts for the future.
	The greater American citizen must know more about American Statesmanship, American
Genius, American Progress, American Institutions, and the inner workings of our American
Government, past, present and future.
	The Messages and Papers of the Presidents are the original sources for this education, and
in these utterances are crystallized the wisdom and experience of our forefathers in history, and
History always repeats itself.
	Congress had this in mind in authorizing the publication of this great work, and in appropri.
ating the necessary amount to defray the initial expenses. 67
	The Hon. AINSWORTH R. SPOFFORD, formerly Librarian of Congress, has accepted the posi-
tion of General Secretary of the Committee appointed to distribute the work. If a private publisher
were to undertake to publish it, even if he could gain access to the Government records, it would cost
not less than a million dollars to produce, and he could not afford to sell it for less than Ten Dol-
lars per volume. The Committee on Distribution has, however, undertaken to distribute the work at ~1
a trifle over the cost of manufacture and distribution. If it is necessary to increase the price to
meet expenses, it will be done later, but not on applications received during month of December.
	A postai card request for fuil particulars, addressed as below, will bring ampie descriptive matter, fuii instructions for
making applications, and several of the magnificent engravings contained in the work, suitable for framing, absolutely free.
	On all requests accompanied by a deposit of ONE DOLLAR a set of the books will be laid aside and reserved pending
further investigation, and if you decide within ten days not to make a regular application for the work, the amount will be

refunded. All requests for further information will receive prompt attention, in regular order, if addressed to

McClures Magazine for 1899
A NEW SERIAL BY

RUDYARD KIPLING
This is a series of stories of schoolboy life, introducing Stalky, Beetle, and Mc-
Turk, heroes of Mr. Kiplings creation already somewhat known. The stories will con-
tinue through a number of months. Each is complete in itself; and to understand and
enjoy one it will not be necessary to read those that precede it. At the same time,
they carry the same characters through a succession of adventures, and readers will
find a special entertainment in following the whole series. The stories show Mr.
Kipling in his most joyous mood; it is clear that he has renewed his own boyhood in
writing them, as he will have renewed the boyhood or girlhood of all who read them.
The first story appears in the December number.


A GREAT HISTORICAL SERIAL
No series of articles, in any magazine, ever had a greater success than Miss Tarbells
articles on the Early Life of Lincoln. As soon as these articles were ended, sub-
scribers began to write in to us asking when they might expect the series promised by
Miss Tarbell on the


LATER LIFE OF LINCOLN
and such inquiries have continued in great numbers ever since. Miss Tarbell was
resolved that no important new material should be overlooked, and by her rare industry
and talent and her exceptional connections, she secured such an abundance that to
bring it within the practical limits of magazine publication has been a long labor. But
the articles begin in the December number.

The Personal Side of Lincolns Life

during the war is what these articles will present. Miss Tarbell has secured through
personal interviews with associates of Lincoln  in the White House, in the Depart-
ments, in Congress, at the headquarters of the several Armies; from surviving members
of his bodyguard; from unpublished correspondence; from. unpublished documents
lately become available at the War Department, and from various other sources
a wealth of new material exhibiting the personal traits and qualities of the man.


CAPTAIN A. T. MAHAN
The War on the Sea and its Lessons

Captain Mahans articles will be the account and interpretation of the naval movements
of the recent war of a man who, in addition to being the foremost authority on naval
science, himself helped to plan the movements which he describes and explains. War
played like a game of chess is the only word for the recent naval campaign; and Captain
Mahan, himself one of the players of the game, explains the cause and purpose of every
move, and shows what results followed. The articles begin in the December number
and will continue through several months, giving, as it were, the inner history of every
naval movement and operation down to the close of the war.


A TELEGRAPH OPERATORS LIFE
Experiences and Adventure as Operator and Train-Despatcher

Captain Jasper E. Brady, now of the Army, began life as a telegraph operator. He
served in commercial and railroad offices in and about all parts of the country and
under all possible conditions. He passed through all the grades up to that of chief
train despatcher; and since he entered the Army he has been detailed to many special
services where his experience with the telegraph and railroads would be particularly
useful. These chapters are

A Series of Choice Stories

from Captain Bradys own experience, illustrating the telegraph operators life in about
all the curious conditions that ever fall to his lot.</PB>

SCIENCE AND INVENTION

THE TELECTROSCOPE
Mr. Cleveland Moffett has lately returned from a visit to the young Polish inventor,
Jan Szczepanik, to examine his wonderful invention that transmits a whole picture by
telegraph so that it comes out to a beholder miles away complete, and even in the
natural colors of the object or scene portrayed; and in an article soon to appear
he gives an interesting account of the inventor and of his invention. The article will
be fully illustrated.
A PLUNGE IN THE DIVING
TORPEDO BOAT
	An article by Franklin Matthews de-
scribes his own strange experience in
going down under the sea in the new
submarine torpedo boat, the Holland.
The article also describes the curious
construction of the boat. She is, un-
doubtedly, one of the most remarkable
products of the mechanical ingenuity of
man.
THE LAKE SUBMARINE
BOAT
	Mr. Lake, inventor of the Lake Subma-
rine Boat, has prepared an article on his
successful cruises on the bottom of the
sea, which cover over 1,200 miles. His
boat has remained submerged for ten
hours, and from it, at the bottom of
Chesapeake Bay, telephone communica-
tions were carried on with Washington,
Baltimore, and New York.
THE MARVELS OF THE SEA
	This is an account of the zodlogical station at Naples, where all the animal and vege-
table growths of the Mediterranean Sea have been gathered, still living, and to which
advanced students from all parts of the world resort to study these growths, as it were,
in a great and beautiful book of living Nature. The article will be fully illustrated,
and will be one of the most interesting of the kind that we have ever published.

MY SCRAP BOOK OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
By ELIZABETH WORMELEY LATIMER. With numerous and carefully selected portraits of the principal per-
sonages of the time. 8vo, 442 pages, $2.50.
	A graphic and thrilling account of some of the most exciting and interesting phases of the French Revolution. Much
of the material is translated direct from original and recent French sources, not easily accessible to the ordinary student.
The narratives of eye-witnesses and of actors and sufferers in the great drama are frequently quoted in detail.

FLORIDA ALEXANDER

of the real. Miss Kinkead has written other tales of tile South, but never so good a one as this.
MARIA FELICIA
A Story of Bohemian Love. By CAEOLINE SVETLA. Translated from the Bohemian by Antonie Krejsa.
( Tales Jrem Fereign Lands Series.) efimo, $t.oo.

	This latest addition to the Tales from Foreign Lands sustains the high and unique reputation of the series. The

EMIN PASHA
His LIFE AND WORK. Compiled from his
journals, letters, scientific notes, and from
official documents by Georg Schweitzer.
With an introduction by R. W. FELKIN,
	M.	D., F. R. S. F., etc. With portrait and
map. 2 vols. demy Svo, cloth, gilt, $io.oo.
This, the first biography of the great explorer,
has been prepared by Entins literary executor, and
has created tremendous interest in England, and is
about to be published in Germany. The Londoet
Times review says: All who are interested in this
part of Africa (the Soudan and Central Africa) 
and who is not at present ?  when the competi-
tion among the European powers is keenest, and
when the forces of darkness are making their
last stand  will welcome this. It is a piece of
rare good fortune that Emins carefully written
and copious diaries have been recovered. ... The
book abounds throughout with matters of interest
to the geographer, the naturalist, the student of
humanity, and all concerned with the recent his-
tory of Africa.
	In the opinion of the Alkeneseem, of London,
the book has a vivid, pathetic, almost tragic in-
terest. It presents a picture of Emin, as revealed
in his often charming private letters, which will do
much to efface the common estimate formed of his
character.... His diary, which is written up to the
date of his murder, reveals a character as intellec
tual as it was unselfish.

	NTERExTED in qoestions of the hi her

qutres him to adopt all the conclusions of the
most cadical critics, Dr. Barton has endeavored
/	in this book to set forth the conclusions to which
~ careful and conservative men have come regard
tog the date of the Psalms and the historical
cii cetmatances under which they were written
~5/ With the frank acknowledgment that in the case
~tv of very many Psalms it is utterly impossibi
7~ fix a date he, nevertheless, has placed every
7	Psalm in the circumstances in which it appears
most ltkely that it was written. The result is a

HENRY COPLEY GREENE.

PLAINS AND UPLANDS OF OLD FRANCE. A Book of Verse and Prose.
	The country described is the Old France of Pdrigord, Burgundy, and Provence. The volume is not a hook of
travel, however, in the ordinary sense, hut a series of delicate and subtle impressions conveyed in a prose style
which is hardly to he matched in its kind by any recent writer. There are ten sketches in prose, alternating with
nine poems. A main feature of the hook is the decorations of George H. Hallowell  comprising the title-page, the
initial letters, and two full-page illustrations of singular originality and beauty. Price, $1.50.

THOPILE. A Miracle Play.
	Mr. Greene hss founded his little drama on the thirteenth century miracle play (of the same name) of Rute-
breuf. It was played last summer in the opeii-air theatre in Dublin, New Hampshire, and is now printed from
type, on hand-made paper in blue paper boards, in a limited edition of 250 copies. The frontispiece is reproduced
from a sketch of a scene in the play, by Miss Cecilia Beaux. Price, $1.00 ad.

THE CHILDRENS CRUSADE. From the French of Marcel Schwob.
	With an introduction by Henry Copley Greene. The path9s and simplicity of the original have been retained
in an English style which is at once sympathetic and individual.
Printed from type, on old italian hand-made paper, with a symbolistic cover design in gray, green,
and purple, by Tom B. Meteyard. Five hundred copies only. Price, 1.50 ad.

DELIGHTFUL STORIES
BY

Kate Doug/as W4~rgIn.
U
	Penelopes Progress.	i6mo, in unique Scottish binding, $1.25.

	This is a continuation of Mrs. Wiggins sensible, humorous, delightful story of Penelopes English Expe-
riences. Penelope and her fellow-tourists invade first Edinburgh and then the outlying districts, and they take
the country and the Scots by storm. The story is an indescribable mingling of good sense and fun.



Marm Lisa. i6mo, $i.oo.

	Little Marm Lisa is a fresh child-figure in fiction. The very interesting story describes the quickening of her
clouded and burdened life, till her pathetic faithfulness ripens, in the climax, into heroism. It is the longest story,
and one of the best, Mrs. Wiggin has written.


The Village Watch Tower. i vol. i6mo, $1.00.
	Each of the stories in its way presents a revelation of certain phases of New England life with s subtlety of
insight and a completeness of range that the most rigid adherent of the formal rules of story-writing might per-
haps notbe able to surpass.  Beacon (Boston).

	Mrs. Wiggins work improves as time goes on. Argonaut (San Francisco).

The Birds Christmas Carol.
Illustrated. Square e2mo, boards, 50 cents.

	The London C/iris/ian World calls it a delightful story, and Literary Opinion, of London, finds it full
of sweet and tender pathos.


The Story of Patsy. Illustrated. Square I2mo, boards, 6o cents.

	I have read Patsy from cover to cover. It is a book of that high order of writing which I call the second
gospel of John,  like Kingsleys Water Babies and Mrs. Ewings Story of a Short Life. Its pathos is
very deep. WM. T. HARRIS, U. S. Commissioner of Education.

Finely illustrated by OLIVER HERFORD. $s.~o.

A Cathedral Courtship.
And Penelopes English Experiences. Illustrated. e6mo, $1.00.
	It is pleasant to meet with an American lady writer so cultivated in style, so susceptible to enthusiasm, and so
capable of seasoning her enthusiasm with quiet humor.  London Times.
	There is only one word that will fittingly describe A Cathedral Courtship. It is delightful.. Punck (London).


Polly Olivers Problem. Illustrated. s6mo, $i.oo.

	The story is a charming, wholesome one, with the merry touches Mrs. Wiggin bestows so happily, and it is a
very ordinary sort of girl indeed who will not be the better and brighter for having with us solved Polly Olivers
Problem. ~Bosto,. TranscriAt.

The
Battle
of
the
Strong
By GILBERT PARKER, author of The Seats of the
Mighty, etc. Izmo, $I.5o. Twentieth Thousand.
	Mr. Parker has written in The Battle of the Strong a most
worthy, dignified, and carefully studied story. The scene is set in
the Channel Islands, chiefly in Jersey, in the midst of a romantic
people and picturesque traditions.  New York Tribune.
	Modern fiction has few finer examples of the perfect woman.
One of the most delightful of quasi-historical tales. It is splen-
didly dramatic. Mr. Parker has in this book finally proved him-
self a master of imaginative fiction.  Scotsman, Edinburgh.
	Guida is a fine character, finely and convincingly presented. The
book is full of varied emotion. It has open-air freshness. It has
stir and movement.  Daily News, London.
	Such a splendid story, so splendidly told, will be read by the
public with avidity.  St. 7ames~s Gazette, London.

The
Black
Curtain
By MARY JOHNSTON. With a Frontispiece Illustration.
Second Impression. Crown Svo, $i.~o.

	A capital story of Colonial Virginia in i6fi3, when Berkeley was
governor.
	The book is one of strong interest, and singularly graphic
power in narration. It has plenty of plot, and incident and ad-
venture enough to satisfy the most exacting in these respects. In
addition to these claims upon the novel-reader it is an admirable
piece of literary work, finished and graceful in point of style and
finely discriminated in its depiction of character.  Boston Herald.


By MAURICE THOMPSON, author of A Tallahassee
Girl, etc. With eight full-page Illustrations by E. W. KEMBLE.

	These stories belong to the same general place and time with
Mr. Joel Chandler Harriss Home Tales. They are mostly
stories of masters and slaves, whose relations are usually friendly,
with some fantastic or humorous element; and the stories, with
Mr. Kembles illustrations, make a very attractive book.


A Novel. By FLORA HAINES LOUGHEAD, author of
The Man Who Was Guilty, The Abandoned Claim, etc.
Crown Svo, $i.~o.
	Among the foot-hills not far from San Francisco, the hero and
the heroine, unknown to each other, simultaneously take posses-
sion of the same section of government land. The friendly contest
for possession is admirably described, and the mystery of a black
curtain in the heros cottage adds to the zest of an uncommonly
interesting story.

are of much variety, ana~ it is believed, of as hig-h
artistic quality as any they have ever offered. The
work of leading interest is

t THE FAIR GOD
HIS tale of the conquest of Mexico, by General
Lew Wallace, is intensely dramatic. It could
hardly be otherwise even if it told in the most
direct and unembellished narrative the wonderful
story of the march of Cortes and his fearless band
through the country from the Gulf of Mexico till
it approached the city of Montezuma; and then
of the brilliant and tragic consummation of his eager and unscrupu-
lous desire. But General Wallace, while setting the historic events
in a clear light, intermingles with them a very romantic love-story;</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00924" SEQ="0924" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="B002">2 HO UGHTON, MIFFLIN &#38; COMPANT


and the manifold attractions of the story have won for it a large and
continuous popularity. It is written with such freedom and force
that one might believe General Wallace had been an eye-witness
of the picturesque and thrilling incidents in the conquest. The
scenery, the simple natives, the fierce Spaniards, the swift-moving
panorama of destruction and capture, all are described with great
vividness and power.
	The Holiday Edition of this remarkable story is in two handsome
volumes, containing forty full-page pictures, many headpieces, and
other illustrations, all by Mr. Eric Pape. This famous artist vis-
ited Mexico to secure historic accuracy and local color for his
designs; he entered most heartily and sympathetically into the spirit
of the story; and the result is a gallery of uncommon grandeur and
beauty, at once an artistic commemoration of the Aztecs and their
civilization, and a series of exquisite illustrations of General Wal-
laces story. The historic and the artistic qualities of the designs
are alike extraordinary.
	The Large-Paper Edition is brought out in an unusually rich
style. The full-page illustrations, printed so as to bring out most
effectively their high artistic qualities, appear on Japanese paper
with gold borders, which set them forth very strikingly. The two
volumes are bound in embossed calf, with an Aztec design, and
are notably handsome.

41 THE BEGINNINGS OF NEW ENGLAND
HE public favor and appreciation shown for Mr. Fiskes
T American Revolution and The Critical Period of American
History, in their illustrated form, are likely to greet The Beginnings
of New England, which is brought out in the same style. The
volume has a large variety of illustrations, every one of which is
included because of its historic value and significance. So the work
is an interesting account of the founding and growth of the New
England colonies for a hundred and fifty years, and at the same
time a series of pictures exhibiting the most conspicuous men, the
most memorable scenes, and the most important documents, of that
highly significant period. Maps and other illustrative material com-
plete the pictorial value of this work. The Large-Paper Edition is
uniform with similar editions of the two works above named, which
have been taken up instantly on publication.

C THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES
T HI S most impressive story, hardly second to The Scarlet Let-
ter, lends itself finely to illustration by appreciative artists.
Miss Maude A. Cowles and Miss Genevieve Cowles, whose designs
for Mr. Frank Dempster Shermans Little Folk Lyrics were among
the most artistic of last years Holiday illustrations, have shown the.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00925" SEQ="0925" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="B003">	HOLIDAY BULLETIN	3

fullest appreciation of Hawthornes genius, and have given ampler
proof of their artistic range and power by the designs they have
made for the Holiday Edition of The House of the Seven Gables.
Their twenty full-page pictures, with many beautiful headpieces
and initials, by Misses Edith and Mildred Cowles, illustrate with
rare skill the scenes and significance of this great story. Very
few Holiday volumes are so well printed and bound as these two
still fewer illustrate an art so strong and so delicate, so command-
ing and so spiritual. In the regular edition it is a work of singular
attractiveness; in the Large-Paper Edition its excellences and beauty
are set forth with the best book-making art of the Riverside Press.

Er A CHILDS HISTORY OF ENGLAND
THE claim of this Holiday Edition of Dickenss deeply interest-
ing book to the attention of seekers of suitable gifts is based
partly on the beauty of the printed page and the attractiveness of the
binding, but far more on the number, variety, and permanent in-
terest of the illustrations. There are forty-eight of these, full-page
engravings, made from photographs taken by Mr. Clifton Johnson,
and they reproduce with perfect accuracy and a quite remarkable
beauty many of the most important scenes and buildings connected
with English history,  cathedrals, abbeys, battlefields, castles, and
landscapes.

Er THE LIFE OF OUR LORD IN ART
AMONG the noteworthy issues of three years ago was a careful-
ly edited and profusely illustrated edition of Mrs. Jameson 5
art works, in five volumes, which have had a good share of popular
favor. Miss Estelle M. Hurll, to whose skill that issue owed no
little of its value, has produced a volume which supplements and
completes that work, namely, The Life of Our Lord in Art. She
gives a history and description of the treatment by artists of every
incident in the life of Christ which has been made the subject of art.
This covers the early and the crude; also the great masterpieces of
Leonardo da Vinci, Tintoretto, and others, and comes down to in-
clude the art of to-day. To this she adds a brief account of the
artistic treatment of the life of St. John the Baptist. The volume
contains sixteen full-page half-tones and over eighty text illustra-
tions. Not a few of the famous specimens of Christ art are here
reproduced; the great Italian masters, the best modern painters, and
leading German engravers are represented.

Er CORONA AND CORONET
WEALTH of illustration as well as sprightliness of narration
may well justify the inclusion among illustrated Holiday
Books of Mrs. Mabel Loomis Todds book, Corona and Coronet.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00926" SEQ="0926" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="B004">4 HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN &#38; COMPANY

It tells the story of the voyage in the yacht Coronet of the astro-
nomical party under Professor David P. Todd, of Amherst College,
to observe the solar eclipse in i 896. The place of observation was
in the northern part of Japan, and Mrs. Todd describes the obser-
vations, the interesting incidents of the voyage, the hairy Ainus of
northern Yezo, and gives some interesting pages to Hawaii, where
the party stayed for a while. The book is bountifully supplied with
illustrations, reproduced from photographs made by the expedition.
It is every way an attractive book, altogether suitable for a gift.

(A WONDER-BOOK, AND TANGLEWOOD TALES
THESE unrivaled stories, by Hawthorne, from some of the most
famous and most significant Grecian and Roman mythological
legends, are now combined in one volume, beautifully printed from
large type, finely illustrated, and handsomely bound. It is a part
of the choicest American literature, almost equally delightful to
youthful readers and older ones, and is admirably suited for a Holi-
day gift.

(THE LEATHER-STOCKING TALES
THE new Riverside Edition of Coopers novels, which have
Leather-Stocking for their hero, is beyond comparison the
best library form in which these have ever been produced. Beau-
tiful large type, handsome binding, and an appropriate frontispiece
illustration to each of the volumes, make a very attractive group of
The Deerslayer, The Last of the Mohicans, The Pathfinder, The
Pioneers, and The Prairie. It would not be easy to find a more
acceptable gift.

(ILLUSTRATED BOOKS OF ADVENTURE
SEVERAL new books which appeal primarily to boys and girls
(but which are very likely to be read with youthful eagerness
by many persons no longer young) may fitly be mentioned here
because they are more or less fully illustrated, and come easily
within the charmed circle of possible Holiday gifts. Mr. Everett T.
Tomlinsons BOYS OF OLD MONMOUTH, a story of Wash-
ingtons campaign in New Jersey in 1778, introduces Washington,
Lee, Greene, Mad Anthony Wayne, Captain Molly Pitcher,
and other notable figures; describes the battle of Monmouth, in
which one of the boys played an active part; and is so full of
historic fact and so well told as to be a particularly interesting book.
	Mr. James Otis tells how, some ten years before the opening of
the Revolution, when the Stamp Act was stirring the colonies to
revolt, THE CHARMING SALLY, a privateer schooner, chased
a British vessel which was bringing some of the hated stamped paper
to America, but failed to capture her or to destroy the paper, and put</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00927" SEQ="0927" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="B005">	HOLIDAY BULLETJN	S

in at Boston harbor, returning then to New York, where some pro-
digiously alert boys had a remarkably patriotic time on her, as they
had when sailing after stamped paper.
	Still earlier, in the time of James the First, IN THE BRAVE
DAYS OF OLD, an English boy and a Dutch boy, according to
the excellent account given by Miss Ruth Hall, clubbed their very
considerable resources of observation, daring, and resolute adven-
ture, and achieved several noteworthy things, such as detecting the
Gunpowder Plot, saving the Dutch town of Sluys from the Spanish
(who probably came to it overland), sailing with Hudson for
America in the good ship Half Moon, spending a winter in Labra-
dor, going to France, marrying and settling at New Amsterdam.
Could more be asked for in one book?
	Mrs. Ellen Olney Kirk does not mingle history with her delight-
ful story of DOROTHY DEANE. One reading it would say she
did not mingle fiction with it, but happening by great good luck to
find an uncommonly interesting little girl, and a very actual com-
panion who had vast possibilities for getting into mischief, also cun-
ning twins, she just told about them what she saw and heard, and
made a very charming story, with a distinct Christmas flavor.
	The Story of LITTLE JANE AND ME, told by M. E., is
good enough, even with but one picture, to be held in careful remem-
brance for gift purposes. It belongs to New York about the middle
of the century, and tells in the most entertaining manner of the plays
and interests of two little girls. It is largely reminiscence, of the
kind that little ones greatly enjoy, and, as in the case of Miss Eliza
0. Whites two winning stories, WHEN MOLLY WAS SIX, and
A LITTLE GIRL OF LONG AGO, older readers find very at-
tractive.



C The number of new volumes in this department
is not large, but a very notable volume is

C THE CAMBRIDGE TENNYSON
	HIS presents Tennysons Poetic and Dramatic Works in a
~single volume, which, though containing over nine hundred
pages, is entirely convenient to handle because printed on thin
paper, which is opaque so that the print does not show through.
The mechanical part of the volume is paralleled by the excellence
of the editorial work, which presents the great wealth of Tennysons
poetry in the most orderly arrangement, with strict accuracy of text,
and furnished with ample notes. Indexes of Titles of Poems and
of First Lines are given, also a Chronological Index to the poems;
and a Biographical Sketch is prefixed. The lines of the longer</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00928" SEQ="0928" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="B006">6 HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN &#38; COMPANY

poems are numbered, making the book excellently adapted for study.
A fine portrait of Lord Tennyson and  on the engraved title-
page  a vignette of his Farringford home, introduce the reader to
this very comprehensive and very satisfactory edition of Tennyson.

C OTHER CAMBRIDGE EDITIONS

T HE COMPLETE POETIC AND DRAMATIC WORKS
OF MILTON are just issued in this form, under the com-
petent editorship of William Vaughn Moody. The poets whose
works are now included in the Cambridge Edition are Longfellow,
Whittier, Lowell, Holmes, Browning, Burns, Tennyson, and Mil-
ton. All have been brought out under the general editorship of
Mr. Horace E. Scudder, and most of them indeed under his exclu-
sive care. All are edited with great thoroughness to secure ac-
curacy of text, completeness as far as possible, sufficient notes,
indexes, biographical sketches, and bibliographical information. All
contain excellent portraits of the poets, and, on the engraved title-
pages, vignettes, generally, of the poets homes. All are printed
on thin, opaque paper, and bound in handsome style. They would
seem to justify the remark of The Outlook: 
The Riverside Press, which has rendered so much genuine ser-
vice to American literature, has done nothing better in its way than
the publication of one-volume standard editions of the poets, .
notable for intelligence and completeness of editorial treatment.

C FROM SUNSET RIDGE

U ND ER this suggestive title Mrs. Julia Ward Howe gathers a
volume which may be regarded as her poetic legacy to man-
kind. It opens with her majestic Battle-Hymn of the Republic,
written by the Potomac as she beheld the encampment of the Union
soldiers in the Civil War, and beginning with the magnificent
line,
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.

Following this are poems previously published but reclaimed for
permanent preservation in this new volume, with many poems not
before included in any book. It is a noble volume of poetry, and
should be noted for Holiday use.

C A CENTURY OF INDIAN EPIGRAMS
A H UNDRED epigrams, meditations, and precepts, attributed
to Bhartrihari, a Hindu king and sage who lived, abdicated,
and wrote epigrams in the early part of the Christian era, have been
translated from the Sanskrit by Mr. Paul E. More. He furnishes an
interesting introduction for the tasteful book, which from its unique
character and its attractiveness would be a good Christmas gift.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00929" SEQ="0929" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="B007">	HOLIDAY BULLETIN	7


C A VICTORIAN ANTHOLOGY
BESIDES writing some of the best American poetry, notably
his Poems now First Collected, published last year and com-
mended in very high terms by the most competent critics, Mr. E.
C. Stedman has prepared an uncommonly good selection of the
best poetry produced in England during the last sixty years. The
Victorian Anthology is every way excellent, and should be borne
in mind by persons seeking a large body of the choicest poetry of
modern times.




C It may be true that all possible plots For novels
have been used, hut fortunately they have not been
used up; and very good stories are told this year, as
good as the stories which orzginally embodied their
plots. One of the most noteworthy of this season
novels is

C THE BATTLE OF THE STRONG
IN which Mr. Gilbert Parker shows his skill in the use of
European historic events to point a moral and adorn a tale,
as he had before shown his skill in using American history for
the background of his Seats of the Mighty and other strong novels.
This new story of a century ago begins on the isle of Jersey,
crosses to France, follows the march of soldiery and the course of
true love, echoes the cries of the French Revolution, and gleams
with the swords of La Vend~e. It is probably the most important
novel yet written by Mr. Parker, and one of the most interesting
of the year.


C PRISONERS OF HOPE
MISS Mary Johnston goes back two centuries and a half for
the characters and incidents of her first novel, which is
universally greeted as an uncommonly good novel for the authors
entrance into the field of letters. The scene is Colonial Virginia
when Berkeley was governor. The characters are gentlemen plan-
ters, redemptioners, slaves, and Indians. The Oliverian conspiracy
is part of the dramatic action; and a very engaging love story
lights up the tragedy and the perplexities which belong to the time.
Critics welcome the story as original, strong, finely charactered,
and effectively told.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00930" SEQ="0930" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="B008">8 HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN &#38; COMPANY


C THE PURITANS
MR. Arlo Batess new story might truthfully be described as
historic, since it uses a famous election of a Bishop in Bos-
ton as one of its most telling features. It also introduces with little
exaggeration sundry social, literary, and religious fads which have
made Boston a subject for the humorous satire of jealous journal-
ists. The author seizes these and other aspects of Boston life with
great adroitness and weaves a story which is generally accounted the
best and most artistic he has yet written.

C A LOVER OF TRUTH
THE truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, spoken
everywhere and always, was the ideal and the achievement of
one of the characters in Miss Eliza Orne Whites new story. He
is by no means the most interesting character; a sensible young
man shines in comparison. The pretty girl; the capable, judicious,
lovable girl,  these add their respective charms to a New England
story told with sprightliness, humor, and literary felicity, as one
would expect from the author of Winterborough, The Coming of
Theodora, and her first story, Miss Brooks, which has just been
taken over from the list of Messrs. Roberts Brothers.

C THE BLACK CURTAIN
THE curtain hung in the rude cabin of an artist who went to
California for his health. To the same section of government
land on which this cabin stood came a young woman, who also
claimed it. Which should have it? The friendly contest over it
gave excellent opportunities for bright conversation and the reveal-
ing of interesting characters. Of course something came of it, which
the black curtain helped to conceal and then proclaim. The story
tells all about it, and is a vigorous, wholesome, firmly told story,
such as the public would look for from the author of The Man
who was Guilty, a powerful story which has not had a tithe of the
honor and popularity it merits.

C THE BLINDMANS WORLD
THIS is the leading story in a group of fifteen, just gathered into
a volume. They were written by Mr. Edward Bellamy,
whose Looking Backward is one of the phenomenal books in Amer-
ican literature; and while they have not the special quality which
made that so exceedingly popular, they are so thoroughly good
stories, so well told, and so instinct with what may be termed the
Bellamy genius and spirit, that they are worthy of wide reading, and
will undoubtedly win it. A prefatory sketch by Mr. Howells adds
one more attraction to the book.</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00931" SEQ="0931" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="B009">	HOLIDAT BULLETJN	9

C LOOKING BACKWARD
J T is altogether too late to commend this book to popular atten-
tion; it has already received this as few American books have.
A new edition, with a fine portrait of Mr. Bellamy and a biograph-
ical sketch by Mr. Sylvester Baxter, may well find a new army of
readers, who will be stimulated to humaner thought and more un-
selfish action by the reading.

C A GREAT LOVE

RS. Clara Louise Burnhams large constituency of readers
find in her new book plenty of love, of a sweet and noble
sort; interesting lovers, who mostly have (with good reason) the
habit of being very hopeful; and story enough to describe all
the felicities and transient trials which accompany true love, and the
benign result.

C STORIES IN LIGHT AND SHADOW
JT seems superfluous to commend Mr. Bret Harte s stories, for a
multitude of readers find them among the most entertaining, and
in a literary way the most attractive, of modern stories. This is
true of the new book above named; also of Tales of Trail and
Town, published last spring.

C PENELOPES PROGRESS
RS. Wiggins latest story was published in April, but its
M humor defied summer heat and gave it a continuous ovation.
It has been accompanied on its prosperous journey through succes-
sive thousands by the admiration and wholesome laughter of a con-
stantly increasing host of readers. Its Scottish readers find it
truthful and irresistibly funny.

C CALEB WEST, MASTER DIVER
MR. F. Hopkinson Smith is regarded by some of the most
thoughtful critics as having initiated a new style of fiction in
his Tom Grogan and Caleb West, celebrating the nobleness of
skilled labor and the romance that may attend the building of a
breakwater and the erection of a lighthouse. Without analyzing
the stories, many scores of thousands have read them, and the de-
mand for Caleb West is still very emphatic.

C A SINGULAR LIFE
J T is two years since this story by Miss Phelps was published,
but from all directions still comes eloquent testimony to its un-
failing hold on readers. The uncommon depth, unselfishness, help-
fulness, and heavenly glow of him who lived the singular life appeal
powerfully and tenderly to those who can appreciate these great
human qualities, which are also divine.</PB>

	     ~i0(Or~ anb Q~io~tap~
E1I~ A very interesting department of literature is
that which eml$ races hooks comhining history
with hiography, and framing the individual
career in the ife of the state. One of the hest
recent hooks of this kind is Colonel Hzg-ginsons

~j CHEERFUL YESTERDAYS
HI S life covers an intensely interesting period in the nations
history, and his delightful volume affords numerous views
of dramatic scenes, including the discussion on slavery, the Kansas
struggle preliminary to the Civil War, and the war itself. It is
peculiarly rich in personal elements, giving glimpses of a multitude
of influential, notable, and interesting men and women, at home
and abroad. The story of his varied career, told with charming
frankness and nobleness of spirit, is uncommonly attractive.

C SAMUEL EDMUND SE WALL
JUDGE Sewall, as he was most frequently called, was a worthy
descendant of the famous Judge Sewall of early Colonial New
England; a chivalrous champion of every good but unpopular
cause; a trusted befriender of the wronged and despised; a wise,
strong, good man, worthy of all honor and confidence. A memorial
of his life and character has been written by Mrs. Nina Moore
Tiffany, which is a fitting tribute to a rare man. A portrait adds
to its value and interest.

C HISTORY OF THE PRESIDENCY
MR. Edward Stanwood has prepared a serviceable book which
gives the salient features of every presidential election in the
United States, the political principles each party professed to hold,
and the results. It describes the effectual minimizing of the Elec-
toral College, and the origin and luxuriant development of the
National Convention. Indeed, it is a repository of countless im-
portant facts relating to the political history of the country; and it
would seem to be one of the indispensable books to students and
teachers of American history.

C THE FIRST REPUBLIC IN AMERICA
M R. Alexander Brown has now added a companion volume to
his important Genesis of the United States. That showed,
among other things, how Spain resisted the efforts of Great Britain</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00933" SEQ="0933" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="B011">	HOLIDAY BULLETIN	II

to colonize and develop this country; this sets forth what Mr.
Brown believes to be the substantial facts regarding the settlement
and early years of Virginia, which are quite unlike the statements
made by Captain John Smith. Without assuming to decide where
Mr. Brown and other historical doctors disagree, it is only fair to
say that Mr. Browns books are of great importance, and abound in
weighty references and full citations.

t THE PILGRIMS IN THEIR THREE HOMES
REV. Dr. Griffis is firmly convinced of the great importance of
the Dutch contribution to the outfit of the Pilgrim Fathers,
and in his late book he sets this forth effectively and convincingly.
This little volume is a valuable account of the Pilgrims in Eng-
land, Holland, and New England. Several pictures lend added
interest to the book.

(THE BATTLES OF TRENTON AND PRINCETON

GENERAL Stryker, Adjutant-Generar of New Jersey, per-
forms what may be called a filial and an official duty in
writing a full and minute account of the two most important Revo-
lutionary battles that took place in his State. He has done it with
so much intelligence and so generous an enthusiasm that he is
entitled to the hearty thanks of historical students.

(DR. WINSORS HISTORIES

THE four octavos by Dr. Justin Winsor, devoted to Christo-
pher Columbus, Cartier to Frontenac, The Mississippi Basin,
and The Westward Movement, are vast treasuries of facts relating
to the discovery of America and the steady push of civilization from
the Atlantic to and beyond the Mississippi. History in its geo-
graphical relations strongly attracted Dr. Winsor, and his books are
of great value in this field. The Narrative and Critical History of
America, which he edited, and to which many American scholars
and historians contributed, comprises eight volumes of priceless
worth.

(DR. FISKES HISTORIES
READERS interested in philosophy have greatly regretted that
Mr. John Fiske relinquished the domain of philosophy for
that of history; but their loss has proved the gain and the delight
of all readers of the history of America. His grasp of facts is so
sure, his treatment of them so orderly and clear, his temper so can-
did, and his style so attractive, that his eight volumes are among
the richest and the most interesting in American literature. These
comprise The Discovery of America (two volumes), Old Virginia</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00934" SEQ="0934" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="B012">12.	HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN &#38; COMPANY


and her Neighbours (two volumes), The Beginnings of New Eng-
land, The American Revolution (two volumes), and The Critical
Period of American History.

C ORIGIN AND GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH CON-
STITUTION

HON. Hannis Taylor, late Embassador of the United States to
Spain, has the good fortune to be the first to treat the entire
development of Constitutional Government from the time of Tacitus
through the great history of English law enlarging and buttressing
English freedom, down to the American Constitution, and our for-

second volume cannot fail to emphasize the favorable judgment
passed upon the first by the most eminent authorities on constitu-
tional history, both in England and America.





C It is an unhappy lancy of the time that the
essay is dropping out of current literature, as it
is another gloomy conceit that the day of good
generous letter-writing is over. But by and by
some of the charming authors of our time will
join their predecessors, and it will be found that
they have left many and delz~htful letters, just as
good as those we now enjoy so much, written by
authors already promoted. And the same may
be true of essays. A good new volume in this
department is

C SOCIAL IDEALS IN ENGLISH LETTERS

MISS Vida D. Scudder, to whom we are indebted for an excel-
lent volume on The Life of the Spirit in the Modern English
Poets, now puts us under fresh obligation by a book in which she
sets forth the results of her study to ascertain what eminent Eng-
lish writers have thought in regard to society and the organization
of human beings in daily life. The most prominent writers on
whom she reports are More, Swift, Shelley, Wordsworth, Thack-
eray, Dickens, Reade, and William Morris; and her book is both
very interesting and instructive.</PB>

C TIDES AND KINDRED PHENOMENA IN THE
SOLAR SYSTEM

PROFESSOR George H. Darwin, son of the man who has
given to the name Darwin a unique distinction, last year de-
livered at the Lowell Institute in Boston a singularly valuable course
of lectures on Tides, their phenomena and causes. He gave a vast
extension of interest to his subject by describing the occurrence of
similar facts in other worlds. These lectures, carefully revised and
accompanied with numerous diagrams and illustrations, form an
authoritative book on tides.

C THE SILVA OF NORTH AMERICA
PROFESSOR Charles S. Sargent has reached the twelfth vol-
ume in his great work on North American trees. His un-
surpassed knowledge in this department stamps these volumes with
great authority; and the illustrative plates are of remarkable accu-
racy and beauty.

C A WORLD OF GREEN HILLS
THIS is Mr. Bradford Torreys attractive title for his new
book, in which he takes us to the mountain region of Vir-
ginia and North Carolina. He shows us the grandeur and beauty
of these hills, and talks in his accustomed easy way of the birds
that sing in them, and the human beings he found occasionally. It
has the same charm which pervades his Birds in the Bush, A Ram-
blers Lease, The Foot-path Way, A Florida Sketch-Book, and
Spring Notes from Tennessee.

C BIRDS OF VILLAGE AND FIELD
MISS Florence A. Merriam, a born bird-lover, whom careful
study and observation have made very bird-wise, adds a
thoroughly practical and interesting volume to American bird liter-
ature. She describes hundreds of varieties of birds living east of
the Mississippi, and pictures of entire birds or of heads add greatly
to the value of the book for bird-students.

C THE MAGIC OF THE HORSE-SHOE
DR. Robert M. Lawrence has made a most interesting contri-
bution to the literature of Folk-Lore by his book on what
may be called the superstition concerning the horse-shoe. Every-
body knows, of course, that a proper regard for the horse-shoe, and
putting it in proper places, will surely bring good luck, while neglect
of its magic qualities may leave the door open to all sorts of annoy-
ance, bad luck, and calamity. But few know how general is the
influence of the horse-shoe, and what antiquity its reign can boast.
Dr. Lawrence tells of this, and of other prevalent superstitions,
and has produced a book of remarkable interest.</PB>

C THE BIBLIOTAPH AND OTHER PEOPLE
MR. Leon H. Vincent, who is a successful lecturer on literary
topics, has gathered into a handsome volume several essays
which form a welcome addition to a charming department of litera-
ture. He writes wisely, wittily, and well of Thomas Hardy, Keats,
Lyly, Priestley, Gautier, and of the interesting ~ bibliotaph, who
had great genius for getting books and virtually burying them.

C FRENCH LITERATURE OF TO-DAY
]\/[ LLE. Blaze de Bury in an attractive volume gives much
J3/j personal information, and mingles appreciative criticism, of
several of the more conspicuous French writers of the time,  Zola,
Bruneti~re, Pierre Loti, Guy de Maupassant, Edmond de Gon-
court, Charcot, Bourget, de Vogii6, Lemaitre, Anatole France,
Mine. Blanc Bentzon, and Paul Verlaine.

C GLEANINGS IN BUDDHA-FIELDS
~fR. Lafcadio H earns latest volume on the Japanese has the
same full knowledge, remarkable appreciation, and inclusive
sympathy for all Japanese persons and things, which have given a
peculiar value and attraction to his previous volumes,  Glimpses
of Unfamiliar Japan, Out of the East, and Kokoro. All have an
affluence of literary qualities of the most engaging kind.

C A STARLIGHT CALENDAR
~/[ISS Kate Sanborn, who has compiled some of the best and
I Vim
ost successful calendars,  A Year of Sunshine, and The
Rainbow Calendar,  continues her prosperous course by gathering
from a host of the worlds best thinkers the passages in which
they prophesied or sang of immortality most persuasively and
hopefully, and grouping these in A Starlight Calendar, which will
be a peculiarly good gift-book.

C UNFORESEEN TENDENCIES OF DEMOCRACY
MR. Godkin, the trenchant editor of the New York Evening
Post, whom some less stalwart and observant critics dispose
of very quickly by calling him a  pessimist, has recently sur-
prised them by the optimistic outcome of his notable book above
named. He depicts the unruly, reckless, happy-go-lucky tenden-
cies in America with unsparing frankness; and then he reassures
us by his faith that the latent, slowly operating, instructed good
sense of Americans will by-and-by awake them to their great re-
sponsibilities and opportunities, and cause them to decree righteous-
ness, and bring it to pass. This is an admirable book to give to
one who needs it and can appreciate it.</PB>

C THE CAMBRIDGE CLASSICS
IN this series are comprised twenty popular and standard vol-
umes, uniform in size and binding. They are crown octavos,
well printed, and attractively bound in red cloth, with gilt tops.
The series includes some of the best and most interesting works of
Hans Christian Andersen, Cooper, Dana, Emerson, Hawthorne,
Holmes, Howells, Lowell, Scott, Mrs. Stowe, Thoreau, and others.
The price is ~I.oo each.




C Among the best and most helpful books in all
literature are those which are devoted to strengthen
in men the great ideas, the faith by which they
truly live.

C THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF PAUL THE APOSTLE
IN this book Dr. Lyman Abbott seeks to extend and confirm
the influence of his former books, The Evolution of Chris-
tianity, Christianity and Social Problems, and The Theology of an
Evolutionist, all of which have been heartily welcomed by a large
circle of readers. He analyzes the various conceptions of God
which have prevailed among Christians,  the pagan, the Jewish,
and the distinctively Christian, the conception of God as Father,
giving life freely to whosoever will accept it. This he finds to be
the great and good news proclaimed by the Apostle Paul.

C THE MAKING AND THE UNMAKING OF THE
PREACHER
PRESIDENT Tucker, of Dartmouth College, delivered a
course of lectures before the Divinity students of Yale Uni-
versity last March, and now brings them out in a handsome vol-
ume. It is a very timely subject at this time, when the preacher
finds himself in an environment in some respects exceedingly per-
plexing and disheartening. Dr. Tuckers book is suggestive, wise,
sympathetic; and the preacher who can read it without decided
benefit must be above the need of help, or below the possibility of
being helped.

C AFTERNOONS IN THE COLLEGE CHAPEL
D R.F rancis Greenwood Peabody, of Harvard University,
gathers into an attractive volume many of the short dis-
courses which he has given at Vesper services at Harvard. Like
those contained in his Mornings in the College Chapel, only longer,</PB>
<PB REF="IMG00938" SEQ="0938" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF5.0" FTR="UNSPEC" N="B016">HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN &#38; COMPANY

they are almost unique in the distinctness with which a single
thought is presented, in forcible and felicitous treatment, in manly
appeal to the listeners highest mood, and in the profound and clear
impression produced. Both of his books are admirable gifts.

C HUMAN IMMORTALITY
DR. William James delivered the second Ingersoll lecture at
Harvard University, in which he sought to meet two sup-
posed objections to the doctrine of human immortality,  the first
based on the fact of physical death, the second on the immense
multitude of human beings. No adequate idea can be given here
of his treatment of the theme, but the fame of Dr. James as pro-
fessor of Philosophy is well sustained in the acuteness, breadth, and
nobleness of his argument. The little book merits very wide and
careful reading.

41i THE GREAT AFFIRMATIONS OF RELIGION
R EV . Thomas R. Slicer, minister of the Church of All Souls,
in New York city, offers a volume containing what he regards
as statements now greatly needed concerning the cardinal points
of religion. His book sets forth those views which in his judg-
ment the scientific thought and the profoundest spiritual concep-
tions of the time affirm about God, Man, the relation between God
and Man, Jesus Christ, Life, and Immortality. The strong con-
viction of the writer cannot fail to impress the reader, and to uplift
his thoughts and deepen his sense of the greatest and simplest
religious facts.

OF THE POETICAL WORKS OF

ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON
With a Biographical Sketch and Notes by WILLIAM J. ROLFE, an
Index to Titles and First Lines, a Portrait, and an engraved title-page
with a vignette. i vol. large crown 8vo, $2.00.

	This single-volume edition of Tennysons Poetical Works is prepared on
the plan pursued in the other Cambridge Editions. Dr. Rolfe, the editor, is
widely known as a careful student of Tennyson, and has already edited sev-
eral separate volumes of his poems. In the notes, several introductions and
brief prefaces, he has made a careful bibliographical study of the poetry, so
that the reader may trace the history of Tennysons poetical work. The
volume includes, in an appendix, the portion of Poems by Two Brothers
assigned to Alfred Tennyson; also those poems from his volumes of 1830
and 1833, and other sources, which have continued to be current in America,
though dropped from collective editions in England.
	It can be said with confidence that no edition of Tefinysons writings can more nearly correspond
with his own final decisions than this. Dr. Rolfes notes and illustrations should be particularly wel-
come to all thoughtful readers of Tennyson, and will answer many questions that have often been asked
in vain, it would he difficult to overstate the benefit conferred on all studious readers of the best Eng-
lish literature by the publication of these cambridge Editions of the Masterpieces.  The Li/erary

A PRIVATE SCHOOL
FOR YOUNG LADlES

makes the advantages of Boston and Cambridge
of service to those who seek a well rounded edu-
cation.

English
is studied with systematic method, and the first
position is given to it.

The course is suited to the pupil
 not the pug5il to the course.

The school buildings are well ventilated, being
open to the air and light on all sides.
The pupils receive such attention in the Resi-
dences as a mother desires for her daughter
when away from home, by ladies who are not
teachers; and the instruction of the school-
room is given by teachers specially trained for
the particular lines of work under their care.
Candidates are fitted for college, but pupils are
able to take continuous courses in the School
much beyond that limit, if desired.

THE ARENA.
A MONTHLY REVIEW OF SOCIAL ADVANCE.

EDITED BY PAUL TYNER.

	A Review that seeks to emphasize and develop the Ameri-
canism which stands for advance all along the line. Radical
and reasonable, progressive yet thoughtful, THE ARENA pro-
vides intellectual food that shall be solid and still digestible.
Its literary standard will be steadily maintained without subor-
dinating force, crispness, and originality in the choice of sub-
jects or their treatment to the conventional canons of criticism.
Absolutely independent and untrammeled by ties of party or
sect, THE ARENAS discuss ions of public questions will be found
at all times fair, candid, and fearless.
	To those who desire to keep abreast of the forward move-
ment, especially in sociology and the new science, THE ARENA
will be indispensable.

SINGER National Costume Series
ITALY (FLORENCE)
V LOR~NC~, La Bella, is a city of the Middle Ages, differing little today,
except in the dress of its people, from the Florence beloved by Dante
and the Della Robbias. it is famous for its palaces and for its collec-
tions of paintings, sculpture, and the manuscripts
resulting from the genius, thought and power in
Florence during the time of the Medicis.
	Ruined by the vice and luxury of that reign,
the Florentines have since made little progress.
Their chief manufactures are of silk and plaited
straw.
	Our photograph shows a Florentine woman of
the industrious middle class stitching a straw hat
into shape by means of a Singer Sewing Machine.
Although the average woman cannot correctly
judge the comparative merits of different sewing
machines, so far as mechanical construction is
concerned, she has a nice appreciation of the differ-
ence in their work. The fact that Singer machines
always turn out good work is the main reason
why they are preferred by the women of all
nations.

IT will be difficult, perhaps, for the numerous admirers of Mrs. Wiggins
I earlier works to grant our claim that in her latest book she has done
the best bit of writing that has come from her pen, but it is so, nevertheless.
Her keen observation, her innate tact and sympathy, her ready wit and con-

in the world. The Kozy tells its own story best;
that s why we like to have you see it and test it.
Many stores have Kozys now, but mail orders keep
our factory running overtime and some dealers
will have to wait. For the present, therefore,
our special offer to send a camera ON TEN

MoNTnL~reader who cannot readily find the Kozy in the stores.

Crown Svo, $2.00.
Thuistrup, I. W. Taber, Alice Barber Stephens, P 1	wood, and C. 0. Weldon.
As the author says in his Preface, there have been many volumes written about the movements of
the armies and about the principal commanders in our Civil War, but the thoughts and feelings of the
private soldier in active service are almost unknown ground to the average civilian. It is this individ-
P ual human side of the army, from a standpoint of peculiar acquaintance and sympathy, with which
D Trumbulls vivid reminiscences deal.

Miss French is not only one of the most popular of American story-writers, but one of the most
thoroughly American in spirit. She has done for the Middle West what Miss Jewett and Miss Wil-
kins have done for New England in faithful characterization. The stories in this volume all turn to
some extent on the relation of employers and employed. They are, however, stories of men in the
widest sense, and leave an extraordinarily cheery, wholesome, and optimistic impression of the men
who really do Anserican work,  the backbone of the Western community.

It is somewhat extraordinary that, with all the literature on the people of old New York, we hay eso
little of these pioneers household affairs, of the womens influence, social ctistoms and manners. M
Van Rensselaers book presents an animated and exhaustive history, in a consecutive narrative, ot

Mr. Chapmans new book is a social and political essay of great penetration and is written with much
pungency. It consists of an elaborate presentation, from various points of view, of the idea that man
is fundamentally unselfish  its deductions being thoroughly practical. The voltinse contains five
chapters: Politics, Society, Education, Democracy, and  Government.

Mr. Henry James says of the title essay in Literature: This essay is the most effective critical at-

of Concord.
