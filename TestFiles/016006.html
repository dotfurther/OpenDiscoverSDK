<b>Abstract:</b>  We describe the blood and intestinal parasites in the Ocellated lizard, <i>Lacerta lepida</i>, examining the factors that determine the prevalence and intensity of infection of haemogregarines, and the prevalence of coccidia and nematodes. In relation to haemogregarines, no juveniles were detected as being infected, whereas 71.7 % of adults were infected. The prevalence of infection was positively related to the size of the adults. There were no differences between seasons or sexes in the prevalence or intensity of infection in adults. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of infection by nematodes between ages or sexes, nor in relation to the size of adult lizards, but adult lizards excreting coccidian oocysts tend to be smaller. During the mating period, reproductive activities lead to a decrease in the body condition. However, neither the intensity of haemogregarine's infection nor the prevalence of intestinal parasites was related to the lizards' body condition.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  We describe the general field population biology of haemogregarines and mites in the wall lizard, <i>Podarcis muralis</i>, examining the factors that determine the prevalence and intensity of infection. The intensity of infection by haemogregarines in females was slightly lower in summer than in spring, whereas males maintained similar levels of intensity among all the seasons, probably due to immunosuppressive effects of testosterone. This is also supported because the prevalence and the infection intensity by mites were higher in males than in females. Parasite load was higher in lizards with better body condition, which could be reflecting the mortality of infected lizards with poor condition.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The study of the effect of parasites on their host populations is essential for understanding their role in host population dynamics and ecology. We describe the general field population biology of haemogregarines in the Iberian rock lizard, <i>Lacerta monticola</i>, examining the factors that determine the prevalence and intensity of infection. Prevalence and infection intensity were higher in adults than in juvenile lizards. The prevalence rate was higher in larger lizards, probably because they were also older and had been more often in contact with parasites during their lifetime. During the mating season, the intensity of parasite infection was greater in males than in females, probably due to immunosuppressive effects of testosterone. The parasite load had a negative effect on the body condition during the reproductive season. The results suggest that the interactions between parasites and hosts are not stable in this lizard population.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Lizards and small rodents were live captured in Tuscany, central Italy, from May through August 2005. Prevalence of infestation by larval <i>Ixodes ricinus L</i>. (Acari: Ixodidae) and mean numbers of larvae per host were not significantly different for common wall lizards, <i>Podarcis muralis Laurenti</i>, and <i>Apodemus</i> spp. mice, whereas infestation levels by nymphs were significantly greater on lizards. <i>Borrelia lusitaniae</i>, which was previously shown to be dominant in host-seeking <i>I. ricinus</i> in the same study area, was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 19.8% (95% confidence interval: 14.4, 26.0) of larval ticks and in 52.9% (27.8, 77.0) of nymphs that were collected from lizards. Moreover, 18.8% (7.2, 36.4) and 25.0 (3.2, 65.1) of lizards' tail biopsies and blood samples, respectively, were positive for <i>B. lusitaniae</i>. Conversely, attached ticks and ear biopsies from Apodemus spp. mice were PCR negative. Passerine birds belonging to 10 species were live captured in March 2005, and <i>Borrelia valaisiana</i> was detected in 57.1% (18.4, 90.1) of <i>I. ricinus</i> nymphs feeding on Eurasian blackbirds, <i>Turdus merula L</i>. Results of this study suggest that lizards play an important role as reservoirs for <i>B. lusitanae</i> and may affect the dominance of this genospecies in the Mediterranean area.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The helminth fauna of 291 <i>Hemidactylus mabouia</i> (Lacertilia: Gekkonidae) from a rock outcrop area in the state of Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, was studied. Five species were recovered, namely one unidentified species of centrorhynchid acanthocephalan (present only as cystacanths) and the nematodes <i>Parapharyngodon sceleratus</i>, <i>P. largitor</i> (Oxyuroidea: Pharingodonidae), Physaloptera sp. (Spiruroidea: Physalopteridae) and one indeterminate species of Acuariidae (Acuaroidea), with the latter two forms present only as larvae. Infection rates tended to increase with host size, but appeared to be unaffected by season. <i>Hemidactylus mabouia</i> shared most of its helminth fauna with two other sympatric lizard hosts, <i>Mabuya frenata</i> and <i>Tropidurus itambere</i>. The helminth assemblage of the <i>H. mabouia</i> population appears to have been entirely acquired by this exotic gecko from the local helminth species pool, rather than possessing any species from the parasite faunas of the original African populations.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The Hamilton and Zuk hypothesis on haemoparasite-mediated sexual selection and certain studies of fitness are based on the assumption that blood parasite infections are detrimental to their hosts. However, there are few reports that have demonstrated harmful effects of endemic blood parasites on fitness in wild populations, and it has even been suggested that they may be non-pathogenic. In this paper, we show that individuals of the Australian sleepy lizard (<i>Tiliqua rugosa</i>) have smaller home ranges when they are infected with the haemogregarine blood parasite <i>Hemolivia mariae</i> than when no infection can be detected. An apparently contradictory result was that lizards with larger home ranges were more susceptible to infection under experimental exposure to Hemolivia. We propose that lizards sacrifice defence against pathogens by increased activity, perhaps associated with maintaining home ranges and mating opportunities. As a consequence, they gain higher parasite loads, which in turn inhibit their activity. In this case, the parasite-host interaction may act as a buffer of lizard activity.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Many studies have shown that potential partners are less likely to be chosen for mating if they are infected with parasites, although most of those studies have considered short-term choices. This paper shows that the Australian sleepy lizard, <i>Tiliqua rugosa</i> (Scincoidea), retains long-term pair fidelity for up to 21 years. However, in some cases pairs separate, and abandoned males have significantly higher tick loads in their last year with their previous female partner than did males that retained their partners from 1 year to the next. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that pair bonds are retained because individuals, both with low infection levels, are less likely to become infected if they remain with the same sexual partner.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Since 1962, a total of 29 species of exotic ticks have been introduced into the United States on imported reptiles, with 17 species from the genus <i>Amblyomma</i>, 11 from the genus<i> Aponomma</i> and one from the genus <i>Hyalomma</i>. In the absence of measures to control introduction of these importations, some exotic tick species will develop breeding colonies and become established as indigenous species and some tickborne diseases may be introduced to wreak havoc among susceptible native populations. However, formulation of risk assessments and rational control measures have been hampered by a lack of knowledge of these exotic ticks, with much of the available data published in older and relatively obscure publications. This report is an attempt to collate information for all 29 exotic tick species, including previously unpublished data from our laboratory, with particular reference to their geographical distribution, hosts, life cycles and vector potential, and to review methods to minimize their global dissemination.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>   Lizards and mammals were trapped and examined for ticks from August 1992 to June 1993 in two habitat types, chaparral and woodland-grass, in northern California. Five tick species were collected from mammals (<i>Dermacentor occidentalis</i>, <i>Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, Ixodes pacificus, I. spinipalpis, I. woodi</i>), but only <i>I. pacificus</i> was found on lizards. <i>Dermacentor occidentalis, I. pacificus</i>, and <i>I. woodi</i> occurred in both habitats, whereas <i>H. leporispalustris</i> and <i>I. spinipalpis</i> were found only on animals trapped in chaparral. The tick species most commonly encountered on mammals was <i>D. occidentalis</i> in chaparral and <i>I. pacificus</i> in woodland-grass. Peak infestation of mammals occurred in spring for <i>I. pacificus immatures</i> and <i>H. leporispalustris</i>, summer for <i>D. occidentalis immatures</i>, fall through spring for <i>I. woodi immatures</i>, and fall through winter for <i>I. spinipalpis</i>. The primary aim of the study was to quantify the relative importance of the western fence lizard (<i>Sceloporus occidentalis</i>), which is reservoir-incompetent for <i>Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato</i> (s.l.), and mammalian <i>B. burgdorferi</i> s.l.-reservoirs as hosts for the immature stages of I. pacificus in spring. The estimated relative utilization by <i>I. pacificus</i> of the western fence lizard versus mammals was 88% for larvae and 99% for nymphs in chaparral in May. When tick infestation data were corrected for a two-fold lower efficiency of field examinations for rodents than for lizards, the western fence lizard still accounted for 78% of larval and 98% of nymphal feedings. In woodland-grass, 46% of 100 <i>I. pacificus</i> larvae and 100% of 52 nymphs recovered from mammals or western fence lizards during May-June were collected from the lizards. However, this may represent an underestimate of the importance of the western fence lizard as a larval host in this habitat because inclement weather during the late May sampling period doubtless resulted in significantly decreased lizard activity. In conclusion, the western fence lizard was more heavily utilized by <i>I. pacificus</i> immatures, especially nymphs, than were rodents.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Lyme borreliosis (LB) group spirochetes, collectively known as <i>Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato</i>, are distributed worldwide. Wild rodents are acknowledged as the most important reservoir hosts. <i>Ixodes scapularis</i> is the primary vector of <i>B. burgdorferi sensu lato</i> in the eastern United States, and in the southeastern United States, the larvae and nymphs mostly parasitize certain species of lizards. The primary aim of the present study was to determine whether wild lizards in the southeastern United States are naturally infected with Lyme borreliae. Blood samples obtained from lizards in Florida and South Carolina were tested for the presence of LB spirochetes primarily by using <i>B. burgdorferi sensu lato</i>-specific PCR assays that amplify portions of the flagellin (flaB), outer surface protein A (ospA), and 66-kDa protein (p66) genes. Attempts to isolate spirochetes from a small number of PCR-positive lizards failed. However, PCR amplification and sequence analysis of partial flaB, ospA, and p66 gene fragments confirmed numerous strains of <i>B. burgdorferi sensu lato</i>, including <i>Borrelia andersonii</i>, <i>Borrelia bissettii</i>, and <i>B. burgdorferi sensu stricto</i>, in blood from lizards from both states. <i>B. burgdorferi sensu lato</i> DNA was identified in 86 of 160 (54%) lizards representing nine species and six genera. The high infection prevalence and broad distribution of infection among different lizard species at different sites and at different times of the year suggest that LB spirochetes are established in lizards in the southeastern United States.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Black turtle (<i>Chelonia mydas agassizii</i>) carcasses, recovered as a result of incidental capture in Magdalena Bay, Mexico, revealed invasion by spirorchiid trematode eggs in liver, kidney, intestines, muscle, heart, pancreas, and duodenum. Seventy-five adult <i>Learedius learedi</i> Price, 1934, were recovered from the heart of 1 turtle. Most of the organs showed a mild or absent inflammatory response in histological sections, with the exception of a pancreatic-duodenal section that revealed severe lymphocyte and phagocyte infiltration associated with an infestation of more than 200 eggs. A linear formation of 35 eggs from the pancreas toward the intestinal lumen is described as resembling migration. This is among the first reports of a parasitic infection of <i>L. learedi</i> Price 1934, in <i>C. m. agassizii</i> in Mexico.<br>

ISSN: 1519-6984.<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  We studied the parasitism by larvae of the chigger mite <i>Eutrombicula alfreddugesi</i> on the lizard community of Restinga de Jurubatiba, Rio de Janeiro State, Southeastern Brazil. We investigated the patterns of infestation (prevalence and intensity) of chigger mites in four sympatric lizards: <i>Tropidurus torquatus, Mabuya agilis, M. macrorhyncha</i> and <i>Cnemidophorus littoralis</i>. All lizards collected were checked for the presence of mites, which were counted under stereomicroscope. We tested the relationship between intensity of infestation and lizard body size for each species using regression analysis. The prevalences and mean intensities (+ one standard deviation) of infestation on each host species were, respectively: 100%; 86.4 + 94.6 in <i>T. torquatus</i> (n = 62); 100%; 20.9 + 9.3 in <i>M. agilis</i> (n = 7); 100%; 11.1 + 13.1 in <i>M. macrorhyncha</i> (n = 12); and 95.2%; 19.1 + 16.8 in <i>C. littoralis</i> (n = 21). Only for <i>C. littoralis </i>did body size significantly affect the intensity of infestation (r = 0.27, p = 0.02). For all lizard species, the body parts where chiggers occurred with the highest intensity were those of skin folds and joint regions.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Two species of reptile ticks, <i>Amblyomma dissimile</i> Koch and <i>Amblyomma torrei</i> Perez Vigueras (Acari: Ixodidae), are reported from the Bahama Islands for the first time. The widespread neotropical (including the Caribbean and southern Florida) A. dissimile was recovered on Andros Island from three species of reptiles all for the first time: the Andros iguana <i>Cyclura cychlura cychlura</i> Cuvier, the Andros curly tail lizard <i>Leiocephalus carinatus coryi </i>Schmidt, and the Andros boa <i>Epicrates striatus fowleri</i> Sheplan and Schwartz. The iguana tick <i>A. torrei</i>, previously known only from Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Cayman Islands, was recovered in the Exuma Islands from the Exuma iguana <i>Cyclura cychlura figginsi</i> Barbour. Mean numbers of ticks per host were as high as 36.6 on Mangrove Cay, Andros Island, and 25.8 on Pasture Cay in the Exuma Islands.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  From 1982-1985 and 1993-1999, a total of 309 individual reptiles, mostly lizards and snakes, belonging to 12 species (American alligator, six lizard species, five snake species) was captured on St. Catherine's Island, Liberty County, Georgia, USA, and examined for ticks. Three lizard species, the broad-headed skink <i>Eumeces laticeps</i>, southeastern 5-lined skink <i>Eumeces inexpectatus</i>, and eastern glass lizard <i>Ophisaurus ventralis</i>, were severely infested with larvae and nymphs of the blacklegged tick, <i>Ixodes scapularis</i>. Ticks were not found on any of the other reptile species. Overall, 80% of 65 E. inexpectatus examined were parasitized by a mean intensity of 21.5 larvae and 88% were parasitized by a mean intensity of 4.8 nymphs. Corresponding figures for E. laticeps (n=56) were 93% and 51.3 for larvae and 89% and 7.4 for nymphs, and for <i>O. ventralis</i> (n=3) were 67% and 22.5 for larvae and 100% and 21.3 for nymphs. Larvae and nymphs attached along the lateral grooves of <i>O. ventralis</i>. Nymphs attached mainly behind the ears and in the foreleg axillae whereas larvae mainly attached to these sites and on the hindlegs in Eumeces spp. Seasonally, both larvae and nymphs were recorded on lizards from April through October. A unimodal larval peak was recorded in May or June. Seasonal data for nymphs did not reveal any distinct peaks but small bimodal peaks in mean intensities may have occurred (one in early summer, the other in late summer) suggesting that some ticks complete their life cycle in one year, and others in two years, on St. Catherine's Island. Potential epidemiological consequences of these findings with respect to Lyme disease in the southeastern United States are briefly addressed.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  We compared the infestation by ixodid ticks of lizards, rodents, and birds collected simultaneously within areas representing common habitat types in Mendocino County, CA. Lizards were infested only by <i>Ixodes pacificus</i> Cooley and Kohls, birds by <i>I. pacificus</i> and <i>Haemaphysalis leporispalustris</i> (Packard), and rodents by <i>I. pacificus, I. spinipalpis </i>Hadwen and Nuttall, <i>I. woodi Bishopp</i>, <i>Dermacentor occidentalis</i> Marx, and <i>D. variabilis</i> (Say). Infestation by <i>I. pacificus</i> larvae and nymphs of lizards (<i>Sceloporus occidentalis Baird</i> and Girard; Elgaria spp.) and western gray squirrels (<i>Sciurus griseus Ord</i>) (means of 9-35 larvae and 5-6 nymphs per animal) was several times greater than for <i>Neotoma fuscipes</i> Baird woodrats, Peromyscus spp. mice, and birds (means of 0.9-3.5 larvae and 0-0.3 nymphs). Overall, Borrelia-refractory lizards accounted for 84% of I. pacificus larvae and 91% of nymphs collected from animals in dense woodlands. Bird species frequently utilizing tick-questing substrates such as leaf litter (guild I birds) were more heavily infested by <i>I. pacificus</i> subadults (5.2 larvae and 1.0 nymphs per bird) than guild IV birds with minimal perceived contact with tick-questing substrates (0.08 larvae and 0.06 nymphs per bird). Notably, guild I birds carried similar larval loads and at least 20-fold higher nymphal loads relative to woodrats and mice. Only guild IV birds carried as few<i> I. pacificus</i> nymphs as did these rodents. The ratios of larvae to nymphs suggest that, relative to birds, lizards, and squirrels (infested by 1.3-6.0 larvae per nymph), nocturnally active ground-dwelling rodents such as woodrats and mice are underutilized by the nymphal stage (69 to &gt;100 larvae per nymph). The western gray squirrel and guild I-II birds (e.g., the dark-eyed junco, <i>Junco hyemalis</i> [L.]) were the only potential reservoirs of <i>Borrelia burgdorferi </i>Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt, and Brenner (the causative agent of Lyme disease in North America) that were frequently infested with both <i>I. pacificus</i> larvae and nymphs and commonly utilized dense woodland habitats.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The helminth fauna of 76 <i>Emydura macquarii</i> from 3 river systems in central and northern Queensland was examined. Eleven species were found, including 2 nematodes, 6 trematodes, 1 aspidogastrean, 1 cestode, and 1 monogenean. Analysis of helminth diversity showed that the Fitzroy and Ross River turtles had communities of comparable diversity, but the helminth communities in Proserpine River turtles were much less diverse. The helminth communities in all localities were dominated by trematodes. <i>Polystomoides australiensis</i> was the most prevalent, being found in 60% of the Ross River turtles, 57% of the Fitzroy River turtles, and 46% of the Proserpine River turtles. <i>Notopronocephalus peekayi</i> was the most abundant species, with mean abundances of 5.9 in the Ross River turtles and 9.8 in the Fitzroy River turtles. Species richness, Simpson's Reciprocal Index, was highest, 4.68, for the Ross River helminth community, Sorensen's Qualitative Index showed 95% similarity between the Ross River and Fitzroy River communities, although Sorensen's Quantitative Index indicated only 35% similarity between the 2 sites. Host feeding patterns are likely the most important factor affecting species richness of the helminth infracommunities, as the majority of helminth species are transmitted by food-web interactions involving intermediate hosts.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Chelonian myxozoanosis is rarely reported and has previously not been documented to cause disease. This report describes myxozoanosis associated with significant renal disease in two Crowned River turtles (<i>Hardella thurjii</i>). One turtle presented with emaciation and died. The cage mate presented with emaciation and was euthanized. Histologically, renal intratubular myxozoan spores were associated with renal tubular necrosis, tubular mineralization, and chronic interstitial nephritis, with membranoproliferative and mes-angioproliferative glomerulopathy. Both turtles also had disseminated metastatic mineralization. On the basis of these findings, chronic renal insufficiency from myxozoanosis and subsequent metastatic mineralization were considered the primary problems. By light and electron microscopy, the myxozoan spores had features of the genus Myxidium. Maximum parsimony analysis of small-subunit rDNA sequences placed the turtle myxozoan basal to a clade containing <i>Myxidium truttae</i> and a Myxidium sp. with strong bootstrap support. This myxozoan agent appears to be a significant pathogen in <i>H. thurjii</i> on the basis of morphologic changes in the kidneys of in the infected turtles.<br>

ISSN: 0042-6822.<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  Fibropapillomatosis (FP) of marine turtles is a neoplastic disease of ecological concern. A fibropapilloma-associated turtle herpesvirus (FPTHV) is consistently present, usually at loads exceeding one virus copy per tumor cell. DNA from an array of parasites of green turtles (<i>Chelonia mydas</i>) was examined with quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine whether any carried viral loads are sufficient to implicate them as vectors for FPTHV. Marine leeches (<i>Ozobranchus</i> spp.) were found to carry high viral DNA loads; some samples approached 10 million copies per leech. Isopycnic sucrose density gradient/qPCR analysis confirmed that some of these copies were associated with particles of the density of enveloped viruses. The data implicate the marine leech Ozobranchus as a mechanical vector for FPTHV.

<b>Abstract:</b>  Two pharyngodonid nematode species, <i>Pharyngodon tiliquae </i>and <i>Thelandros trachysauri</i>, infect the Australian lizard <i>Egernia stokesii</i> (gidgee skink) in populations from South Australia. Eggs are detected in lizard scats that are deposited in piles outside the rock crevice refuges that the lizards occupy. Eggs were isolated by salt flotation from fresh scats and from scats that had been dried in simulated field conditions for 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. Egg counts decreased with drying time for both nematode species, but <i>T. trachysauri </i>eggs were still detected after 28 days of drying, whereas <i>P. tiliquae</i> eggs were rarely detected after 14 days. These results suggest that egg counts can be used to infer host infection status only from relatively fresh scats and that eggs of the 2 species persist in a state where they can be detected by standard flotation techniques, for different times.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A lethargic southern black racer, <i>Coluber constrictor priapus</i> Dunn and Wood, wild-caught in the Florida Keys, Monroe County, FL, was found to be paralyzed by the bite of a female ixodid tick, <i>Amblyomma rotundatum</i> Koch (Acari: Ixodidae). Removal of the tick restored the snake to normalcy within 18 h. Other, earlier reported cases of tick toxicosis in reptiles are reviewed and clarified. Evidently, the present incident is the only reported case of tick paralysis in a poikilotherm found in a natural setting.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Myxosporeans are common parasites of fish, and uncommon parasites of amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates, that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The common genus <i>Myxidium</i> infects the excretory system of turtles, yet knowledge of its pathogenicity in these hosts is limited. We offer new knowledge of morphological and ultrastructural aspects of host-parasite interactions in <i>Myxidium</i> infections from our recent diagnostic investigations on captive freshwater turtles listed in CITES (Appendix II). We investigated the cause of death of 2 adult Indo-Gangetic flap-shelled turtles <i>Lissemys punctata andersonii</i> from a zoo collection. After post-mortem examination, tissues were processed for histopathology, and special stains were used to demonstrate morphology of myxosporean spores. Additional kidney tissue, immersion-fixed in formalin, was processed for transmission electron microscopy. Both turtles were infected with a myxosporidian, <i>Myxidium mackiei</i>, in the kidney, which occluded 5 to 10% of the renal proximal convoluted tubules. The polysporic plasmodia contained pairs of developing and mature spores. Each mature, spindle-shaped spore had 2 asymmetric valves (1 overlapping, 1 overlapped), with 10 to 13 and 10 to 14 longitudinal ridges per valve, and 2 polar capsules each containing a polar filament with 4 to 5 turns. A pair of spores, each surrounded by a membrane-bound electron-lucent matrix, lay in an enclosing cell within the plasmodium. Regions of the parasite-host interface consisted of undulations of the parasite surface, with intense pinocytotic activity beneath, intermingled with the hosts' microvilli, and endocytotic channels at the apex of renal epithelial cells. The microvilli of the renal epithelial cells of infected tubules were frequently sheared or compressed, or occasionally missing; we did not detect other pathology induced by the parasite. Our report of <i>M. mackiei</i> in <i>L. punctata</i> is a new host record. Both individuals also had disseminated pale yellow nodules (bacterial granulomas) present in lung, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle, and both were infected with coccidia (tentatively identified as Eimeria sp.) in multiple organs. The cause of death for one turtle was septicemia, but remained unknown for the other individual.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  <i>Chalcides ocellatus</i>, a scincid lizard, sampled during October 1998 to December 1999 from Benina (farmland) and Al-Kueffia (a rocky area) in Benghazi, Libya, was found to harbour three intestinal nematodes, <i>Pharyngodon mamillatus</i>, <i>Thelandros alatus</i> and <i>Parapharyngodon micipsae</i>, and an intestinal cestode, <i>Oochoristica tuberculata</i>. <i>Thelandros alatus</i>, <i>P. micipsae</i> and <i>O. tuberculata </i>were recorded for the first time in <i>C. ocellatus</i>. <i>Parapharyngodon micipsa</i>e was detected in <i>C. ocellatu</i>s from Benina and <i>O. tuberculata</i> from lizards in Al-Kueffia. The majority (87.6%) of <i>C. ocellatus</i> were infected with helminth parasites and the levels of infection were higher in males than in females but this difference was not significant. <i>Pharyngodon mamillatus</i> recorded the highest number of nematode parasites in <i>C. ocellatus</i>, although there was no relationship between the number of nematode parasites recovered and host density. In lizards infected with the cestode <i>O. tuberculata</i>, males had shorter snout-vent lengths than females. From a total of 153 <i>C. ocellatus</i>, 120 (78.4%) showed single and 14 (9.2%) showed mixed parasitic infections. Mixed infections between different species of nematodes were not observed.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The variation in the component community structure of intestinal helminths in the lizard <i>Chalcides ocellatus</i> (Forskal, 1775) was studied in relation to the seasonal variation and host weight and sex. 120 lizards were collected seasonally during year 2004, from Al Firdan, Ismailia governorate, Egypt. The helminths community consisted of six species (five nematodes and one cestode). The various helminths differed according to host sex. The prevalence of total helminths infection was 67.6 % while the prevalences of <i>Thelandros schusteri</i>, <i>Pharyngodon mamillatus</i>, <i>Parapharyngodon bulbosus</i>, <i>Cosmocerca vrcibradici</i>, <i>Spauligodon petersi</i> and <i>Oochoristica maccoyi</i> were 43.4%, 3.9 %, 13.2%, 5.3%, 6.6%, and 14.3%, respectively. The results showed that the season was the main factor affecting infracommunity species richness and parasite abundance. Moreover, there was interaction between season and host sex on abundance of <i>P. bulbosus</i>. The prevalence of intestinal helminths varied significantly in relation to host weight classes and sex in some species. Helminths abundance and intensity were independent from host sex. In addition, correlations were found between total helminths abundance and host weight. In conclusion, the helminths community of <i>C. ocellatus</i> was depauperate and the influence of the studied factors varied from species to another one. We cannot say if the low species richness and infection rates observed in the present study are typical of the host species or if they are due to characteristics of the study area, since no available data on parasite assemblages exist for other <i>C. ocellatus</i> populations.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Beginning in October 2000, subadult loggerhead sea turtles <i>Caretta caretta</i> showing clinical signs of a neurological disorder were found in waters off south Florida, USA. Histopathology indicated generalized and neurologic spirorchiidiasis. In loggerhead sea turtles (LST) with neurospirorchiidiasis, adult trematodes were found in the meninges of the brain and spinal cord of 7 and 3 affected turtles respectively, and multiple encephalic intravascular or perivascular eggs were associated with granulomatous or mixed leukocytic inflammation, vasculitis, edema, axonal degeneration and occasional necrosis. Adult spirorchiids were dissected from meningeal vessels of 2 of 11 LST brains and 1 of 10 spinal cords and were identified as <i>Neospirorchis</i> sp. Affected LST were evaluated for brevetoxins, ciguatoxins, saxitoxins, domoic acid and palytoxin. While tissues from 7 of 20 LST tested positive for brevetoxins, the levels were not considered to be in a range causing acute toxicosis. No known natural (algal blooms) or anthropogenic (pollutant spills) stressors co-occurred with the turtle mortality. While heavy metal toxicosis and organophosphate toxicosis were also investigated as possible causes, there was no evidence for their involvement. We speculate that the clinical signs and pathologic changes seen in the affected LST resulted from combined heavy spirorchiid parasitism and possible chronic exposure to a novel toxin present in the diet of LST.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Intraerythrocytic bodies identified as haemogregarine gamonts were found in 29% of 97 brown tree snakes (<i>Boiga irregularis</i>) examined during a haematological survey of reptiles in Australasia during 1994-1998. The morphological characteristics of the parasites were consistent with those of <i>Haemogregarina boigae</i> Mackerras, 1961, although the gamonts were slightly larger and lacked red caps but contained distinctive polar grey capsules. Gamonts did not distend host cells but laterally displaced their nuclei. They were contained within parasitophorous vacuoles and possessed typical apicomplexan organelles, including a conoid, polar rings, rhoptries and micronemes. Schizonts producing up to 30 merozoites were detected in endothelial cells of the lungs of 11 snakes. The absence of erythrocytic schizogony suggests the parasites belong to the genus Hepatozoon. Electron microscopy also revealed the presence of curious encapsulated organisms in degenerating erythrocytes. These stages did not possess apical complex organelles and were surrounded by thick walls containing circumferential junctions and interposed strips reminiscent of oocyst sutures.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Seventy-two Mexican garter snakes (<i>Thamnophis eques</i>) and 126 black-bellied garter snakes (<i>T. melanogaster</i>) were collected from 4 localities of the Mesa Central of Mexico between July 1996 and February 1998 and examined for helminths. Both species of garter snakes occurred sympatrically in every locality except in Lake Cuitzeo. Both species of snakes shared 9 helminth species, and in general, <i>T. melanogaster</i> hosted a larger number of species than <i>T. eques</i>. In each locality, a different helminth species showed the highest levels of prevalence and abundance (<i>Spiroxys susanae</i> in Cienaga de Lerma, <i>Telorchis corti</i> in Lago de Patzcuaro, <i>Proteocephalus variabilis</i> in Lago de Cuitzeo, and <i>Contracaecum sp</i>. in Lago de Chapala). Helminth communities in garter snakes of the Mesa Central are depauperate and dominated by a single parasite species. In those localities where the snakes occurred in sympatry, helminth communities were, in general, more diverse and species-rich in <i>T. melanogaster</i>. Differences in the ecology and physiology of these species of garter snakes may explain this pattern because black-bellied garter snakes (<i>T. melanogaster</i>) are more aquatic than Mexican garter snakes (<i>T. eques</i>) and primarily eat aquatic prey, potentially exposing themselves to a larger number of helminths transmitted by predator-prey infection. The helminth infracommunities of garter snakes in the Mesa Central of Mexico show a strong Nearctic influence because most of the species infecting these hosts have been recorded in other Nearctic colubrid snakes. However, the helminth infracommunities of these garter snakes are less species-rich and less diverse than those in colubrid snakes in more temperate latitudes. The widespread ecological perturbation of sampling sites in the Mesa Central because of human activity, and geographic differences in foraging ecology of the hosts and, thus, exposure to parasites transmitted by intermediate hosts may help to explain these patterns.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A review is made of the recorded species of the coccidian genus <i>Cyclospora</i> and major events leading up to the discovery of <i>C. cayetanensis</i>, which is responsible for serious outbreaks of diarrhoea in man and is one of the aetiological agents of &quot;traveller's diarrhoea&quot;.

<b>Abstract:</b>  <i>Eimeria carmelinoi n</i>.sp., is described in the teiid lizard <i>Kentropyx calcarata Spix</i>, 1825 from north Brazil. Oocysts subspherical to spherical, averaging 21.25 x 20.15 micro m. Oocyst wall smooth, colourless and devoid of striae or micropyle. No polar body or conspicuous oocystic residuum, but frequently a small number of fine granules in Brownian movement. Sporocysts, averaging 10.1 x 9 microm, are without a Stieda body. Endogenous stages characteristic of the genus: intra-cytoplasmic, within the epithelial cells of the ileum and above the host cell nucleus. A re-description is given of a parasite previously described as <i>Eimeria cnemidophori,</i> in the teiid lizard <i>Cnemidophorus lemniscatus lemniscatus</i>. A study of the endogenous stages in the ileum necessitates renaming this coccidian as <i>Acroeimeria cnemidophori</i> (Carini, 1941) nov.comb., and suggests that <i>Acroeimeria pintoi </i>Lainson &amp; Paperna, 1999 in the teiid <i>Ameiva ameiva</i> is a synonym of <i>A. cnemidophori</i>. A further intestinal coccidian, <i>Acroeimeria paraensis n</i>.sp. is described in <i>C. l. lemniscatus</i>, frequently as a mixed infection with <i>A. cnemidophori</i>. Mature oocysts, averaging 24.4 x 21.8 microm, have a single-layered, smooth, colourless wall with no micropyle or striae. No polar body, but the frequent presence of a small number of fine granules exhibiting Brownian movements. Sporocysts 9 x 8, without a Stieda body. Endogenous stages epicytoplasmic, characteristic of the genus, in the upper ileum. The importance of a study of the endogenous stages of eimeriid coccidia is discussed.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Three different haematozoan parasites are described in the blood of the teiid lizard <i>Ameiva ameiva</i> Linn. from North Brazil: one in the monocytes and the other two in erythrocytes. The leucocytic parasite is probably a species of <i>Lainsonia Landau</i>, 1973 (Lankesterellidae) as suggested by the presence of sporogonic stages in the internal organs, morphology of the blood forms (sporozoites), and their survival and accumulation in macrophages of the liver. One of the erythrocytic parasites produces encapsulated, stain-resistant forms in the peripheral blood, very similar to gametocytes of <i>Hemolivia Petit</i> et al., 1990. The other is morphologically very different and characteristically adheres to the host-cell nucleus. None of the parasites underwent development in the mosquitoes <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i> and <i>Aedes aegypti </i>and their behaviour in other haematophagous hosts is under investigation. Mixed infections of the parasites commonly occur and this often creates difficulties in relating the tissue stages in the internal organs to the forms seen in the blood. Concomitant infections with a <i>Plasmodium tropiduri</i>-like malaria parasite were seen and were sometimes extremely heavy.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  This paper reports prevalence of coccidial oocysts in fecal samples from 6 endemic and 2 introduced lizard species on Mauritius, an island nation in the Indian Ocean. Total coccidian prevalence was 54% (n = 341) for the endemic 'ornate day gecko,' <i>Phelsuma ornata</i>; 48% (n = 159) for the endemic 'Durrell's night gecko,' <i>Nactus durrelli</i>; 53% (n = 15) for the endemic 'Serpent Island night gecko,' <i>N. serpensinsula</i>; and 78% (n = 248) for the introduced gecko, <i>Hemidactylus frenatus</i>. These high prevalences may reflect lack of long-lasting immune response to coccidial infection. There were few significant differences in prevalence among age, island, sex, or body condition within species, suggesting that these coccidia are relatively nonpathogenic and have little effect on host fitness. Prevalence was higher in the dry season than the wet season. These data suggest other factors, such as low host immune response to reinfection, affect overall prevalence more significantly than the effect of humidity on oocyst survival on Mauritius. No coccidia were found in samples from the endemic 'Gunner's Quoin night gecko,' <i>N. coindemirensis</i> (n = 155), probably reflecting parasite extinction due to a host population bottleneck following historical introduction of rats. There was no evidence of competitive or facilitative interactions between <i>Eimeria</i> sp. and <i>Isospora</i> sp., but evidence of competition between 2<i> Eimeria</i> species in the 'ornate day gecko,' <i>Phelsuma ornata</i>. No evidence was found of cross-species infection, suggesting that reptile coccidia have high host specificity and are, therefore, poor subjects for studies of parasite-mediated competition and the evolution of sex.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  An imported 2.5-yr-old female green iguana (<i>Iguana iguana rhinolopa</i>) kept in Greece was presented with a history of anorexia and allotriophagy of 1 mo duration. Upon clinical examination, it was cachectic and had severe abdominal distension and fibrous osteodystrophy. Despite treatment, it died a month later. On necropsy, massive accumulations of threadlike nematode parasites were observed in the large intestine, identified as <i>Ozolaimus megatyphlon,</i> a member of the Oxyuridae family of Pharyngodonidae, a usually nonpathogenic intestinal parasite of iguanas. To the authors' knowledge, its presence has not been reported previously in Europe, although one pathogenic infection has been reported previously in Japan. The animal was presumably infected before importation. Although death was attributed to the heavy parasitic overload, the poor diet and terrarium hygiene, and absence of an anthelminthic regime further contributed to the deterioration of the animal's condition. Recognition of this condition, which may be recently introduced or underdiagnosed, may help improve medical and trade standards concerning this species in practice.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A survey of gastro-intestinal helminth communities of <i>Gallotia stehlini </i>(Sauria: Lacertidae) from Gran Canaria island (Canary Archipelago, Spain), was conducted to determine the prevalence, abundance and species diversity of intestinal parasites in these lizards. Pharyngodonid nematodes were the most common intestinal helminths, three species being Gallotia specialists. Helminth infracommunities of <i>G. stehlini</i> were rich and appear to be closer to the interactive end of the continuum isolationist-interactive helminth communities, according to the high values of helminth diversity. It is the first case of a saurian reptile showing this kind of diverse helminth infracommunity, produced by a large size, a wide-ranging plant diet and exposure to helminths with direct life-cycles.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A sample of 101 specimens of the unisexual whiptail lizard <i>Cnemidophorus nativo</i> (Squamata; Teiidae) from a coastal site in Bahia State, Brazil were examined for the presence of endoparasites. Of these, 35 (34.7%) harboured helminths. Six helminth species were recovered from <i>C. nativo</i>, including five nematodes (<i>Physaloptera retusa, Physalopteroides venancioi, Subulura lacertilia, Skrjabinelazia intermedi</i>a and <i>Parapharyngodon sp</i>., and one cestode (<i>Oochoristica ameivae</i>), all representing new host records. Most lizards were infected by a single species of helminth and none by more than three. Infection rates were neither significantly influenced by host body size nor by environmental factors. The results are compared with data from studies on other whiptail species in both South and North America.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  During an extensive study regarding the epidemiology of larval Eustrongylides infestation in a free-ranging endangered population of dice snakes () from Histria, Romania, an adult female was euthanized to evaluate pathologic changes. Parasites appeared as nodules at various locations: in subcutaneous connective tissues, on the serosae of the intestines and liver. Histologic sections revealed nematode larvae surrounded by a capsule, forming a parasitic granuloma with 3 layers: macrophage layer, lymphocyte layer, and fibrous capsule. Differences between newly formed and mature granulomas consisted mainly in the eosinophilic infiltration. Other types of parasitic granulomas of reptiles are discussed in comparison with our findings.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  <i>Hepatozoon</i> species are the most abundant hemoparasites of snakes. Its identification has been based mainly on the morphologic characterization of the gamonts in the peripheral blood of the vertebrate host and also of the cysts found in the internal organs of the vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Using a computerized image analysis system, we studied five species of <i>Hepatozoon</i> from recently captured snakes in Botucatu, State of S o Paulo, Brazil, to evaluate the importance of the morphology and morphometry of the gamonts for the characterization of <i>Hepatozoon</i> species and to analyze the morphologic changes induced in the erythrocytes by the parasite. The studied species were <i>H. terzii </i>of <i>Boa constrictor amarali</i>, <i>Hepatozoon</i> sp. of <i>Crotalus durissusterrificus</i>, <i>H. philodryasi</i> of <i>Philodryas patagoniensis</i>, and <i>H. migonei</i> and <i>H. cyclagrasi</i> of <i>Hydrodynastes gigas</i>. We observed three different groups, one of them including the species <i>H. terzii, H. philodryasi </i>and <i>Hepatozoon </i>sp. of <i>C. durissus terrificus</i>; and the other two consisting of <i>H. migonei</i> and <i>H. cyclagrasi</i>. Degree of alterations in the erythrocytes was variable and it may be useful for characterization of <i>Hepatozoon</i> species.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  <i>Caryospora duszynskii Upton</i>, Current et Barnard, 1984 was successfully transmitted to snakes of the genus <i>Elaphe</i> by feeding them previously infected mice. Fifty thousand oocysts were orally administered to two mouse strains, BALB/c and Crl:CD-1(ICR)BR, which were subsequently fed to captive-born coccidia-free <i>Elaphe guttata</i> (L.) in two respective independent experiments. Both <i>E. guttata</i> expelled <i>C. duszynskii</i> oocysts in their faeces, beginning on day 18 and 26 post infection (p.i.) and shed oocysts continuously through the end of the experiment, day 230 and 135 p.i., respectively. There were no parasitic stages or lesions in mice, as revealed by histological examination. Experiments proved that rodents serve as paratenic hosts for <i>C. duszynskii</i>. In summary we discuss the life-cycle strategies of <i>Caryospora</i> spp. in reptiles and present three general modes of their development.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  <i>Dracunculus globocephalus</i> Mackin, 1927 (Nematoda: Dracunculoidea) is redescribed from specimens collected from the mesentery of the snapping turtle, <i>Chelydra serpentina</i> (L.), in Louisiana, USA. The use of scanning electron microscopy, applied for the first time in this species, made it possible to study details in the structure of the cephalic end and the arrangement of male caudal papillae that are difficult to observe under the light microscope. This species markedly differs from all other species of Dracunculus in having the spicules greatly unequal in size and shape, in the absence of a gubernaculum, and in the disposition of male caudal papillae. The validity of <i>D. globocephalus</i> is confirmed, but the above mentioned morphological differences are not sufficient for listing it in a separate genus. This is the first record of <i>D. globocephalus</i> in Louisiana.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A range of digestive tract specializations were compared among dietary categories in the family Liolaemidae to test the hypothesis that herbivores require greater gut complexity to process plant matter. Additionally, the hypothesis that herbivory favors the evolution of larger body size was tested. Lastly, the association between diet and hindgut nematodes was explored. Herbivorous liolaemids were larger relative to omnivorous and insectivorous congeners and consequently had larger guts. In addition, small intestine length of herbivorous liolaemids was disproportionately longer than that of congeners. Significant interaction effects between diet and body size among organ dimensions indicate that increases in organ size occur to a greater extent in herbivores than other diet categories. For species with plant matter in their guts, there was a significant positive correlation between the percentage of plant matter consumed and small intestine length. Herbivorous liolaemids examined in this study lacked the gross morphological specializations (cecum and colonic valves) found in herbivores in the families Iguanidae and Agamidae. A significantly greater percentage of herbivorous species had nematodes in their gut. Of the species with nematodes, over 95% of herbivores had nematodes only in the hindgut. Prevalence of nematodes in the hindgut of herbivores was 2 x that of omnivores and 4 x that of insectivores.<br>

These are the third and fourth species referred to Choanocotyle. <i>Choanocotyle hobbsi</i> is most similar to <i>Choanocotyle nematoides</i> but differs in the size and shape of the oral sucker and the absence of a median loop in the cirrus sac. <i>Choanocotyle juesuei</i> is most similar to <i>Choanocotyle elegans</i> but differs in the size of the oral sucker and other morphometric criteria. Comparative analysis of the sequences of different nuclear ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid regions of <i>C. nematoides</i> and <i>C. hobbsi</i> has confirmed that they are closely related but distinct species.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Since 1995, <i>Trichinella</i> larvae have been detected in 39.5% of farmed crocodiles (<i>Crocodylus niloticus</i>) in Zimbabwe. Morphological, biological, biochemical and molecular studies carried out on one isolate from a farmed crocodile in 2001 support the conclusion that this parasite belongs to a new species, which has been named <i>Trichinella zimbabwensis n</i>.sp. This species, whose larvae are non-encapsulated in host muscles, infects both reptiles and mammals. The morphology of adults and larvae is similar to that of <i>Trichinella papuae</i>. Adults of <i>T. zimbabwensis</i> cross in both directions with adults of <i>T. papuae</i> (i.e. male of <i>T. zimbabwensis</i> per female of <i>T. papuae</i> and male of <i>T. papuae</i> per female of <i>T. zimbabwensis</i>), producing F1 offspring which produce very few and less viable F2 larvae. Muscle larvae of <i>T. zimbabwensis</i>, like those of <i>T. papuae</i>, do not infect birds. Three allozymes (of a total of 10) are diagnostic between <i>T. zimbabwensis</i> and <i>T. papuae</i>, and five are diagnostic between <i>T. zimbabwensis</i> and <i>Trichinella pseudospiralis</i>, the third non-encapsulated species. The percentage of the pairwise alignment identity between <i>T. zimbabwensis</i> and the other Trichinella species for the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene, the large subunit ribosomal-DNA (mt-lsrDNA) gene and the expansion segment five, shows that <i>T. zimbabwensis</i> is more similar to the two non-encapsulated species <i>T. papuae</i> (91% for cytochrome oxidase I; 96% for mt-lsrDNA; and 88% for expansion segment five) and <i>T. pseudospiralis</i> (88% for cytochrome oxidase I; 90% for mt-lsrDNA; and 66-73% for expansion segment five) than to any of the encapsulated species (85-86% for cytochrome oxidase I; 88-89% for mt-lsrDNA; and 71-79% for expansion segment five). This is the first non-encapsulated species discovered in Africa. The finding of a new <i>Trichinella</i> species that infects both reptiles and mammals suggests that the origin of <i>Trichinella </i>parasites dates back further than previously believed and can contribute to understanding the phylogeny and the epidemiology of the genus <i>Trichinella</i>.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The discovery of <i>Trichinella zimbabwensis</i> in farm crocodiles of Zimbabwe has opened up a new frontier in the epidemiology of the <i>Trichinella</i> genus. The objective of the present study was to investigate the infectivity of encapsulated species (<i>T. spiralis, T. nativa, T. britovi, T. murrelli </i>and <i>T. nelsoni</i>) and non-encapsulated species (<i>T. pseudospiralis, T. papuae</i> and <i>T. zimbabwensis</i>) in caimans (<i>Caiman crocodilus</i>), varans (<i>Varanus exanthematicus</i>), pythons (<i>Python molurus bivittatus</i>) and turtles (<i>Pelomedusa subrufa</i>) raised at their natural temperature range (26-32 degrees C). Mice and chickens were used as controls. At 6 days post-infection (p.i.), adult worms were detected in the small intestine of reptiles infected with <i>T. papuae</i> and <i>T. zimbabwensis</i>, of chickens infected with <i>T. pseudospiralis</i> and of mice infected with all encapsulated and non-encapsulated species. At 60 days p.i., <i>T. papuae </i>and <i>T. zimbabwensis</i> adult worms were collected from the intestine of varans and caimans and larvae from muscles of the four reptile species, <i>T. pseudospiralis</i> larvae from muscles of chickens, and larvae of all <i>Trichinella</i> species from mouse muscles. The highest reproductive capacity index of both <i>T. papuae</i> and <i>T. zimbabwensis</i> was observed in varans. The results show that <i>T. papuae</i> and <i>T. zimbabwensis</i> are able to complete their entire life-cycle in both poikilothermic and homoiothermic animals.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The recent discovery of <i>Trichinella zimbabwensis</i> in farmed crocodiles (<i>Crocodilus niloticus</i>) of Zimbabwe and its ability to infect mammals, and the development of both <i>T. zimbabwensis</i> and <i>Trichinella papuae</i> in experimentally infected reptiles led to an investigation of <i>Trichinella</i> infection in saltwater crocodiles (<i>Crocodylus porosus</i>) and in wild pigs (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) of Papua New Guinea, to see if <i>T. papuae</i> also, is present in both cold- and warm-blooded animals. Of 222 crocodiles examined, 47 animals (21.2%), all from Kikori, Gulf Province, were positive for non-encapsulated larvae in the muscles. The greatest number of larvae was found usually in the biceps, with an average of 7 larvae/g. One isolate from a crocodile infected successfully both laboratory rats and mice. Of 81 wild pigs examined, 9 from Bensbach river area (Western Province) and 1 from Kikori area (Gulf Province) were positive for non-encapsulated larvae in the muscles. <i>Trichinella</i> larvae from both saltwater crocodiles and wild pigs have been identified by multiplex-PCR analysis as <i>T. papuae</i>. The sequence analysis of the region within the large subunit ribosomal DNA, known as the expansion segment V, has shown the presence of a molecular marker distinguishing <i>T. papuae</i> isolates of Bensbach river area from those of Kikori area. This marker could be useful to trace back the geographical origin of the infected animal. The epidemiological investigation carried out in the Kikori area has shown that local people catch young crocodiles in the wild and keep them in holding pens for several months, before sending them to the crocodile farm in Lae (Morobe Province). They feed the crocodiles primarily with wild pig meat bought at the local market and also with fish. These results stress the importance of using artificial digestion for routinely screening of swine and crocodiles, and of adopting measures for preventing the spread of infection, such as the proper disposal of carcasses and the adequate freezing of meat.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Two hundred and forty-four specimens of <i>Parapharyngodon riojensis n</i>. sp. were found in the large intestines of 2 adult lizards <i>Phymaturus punae</i> collected from Quebrada del Leoncito, Province of La Rioja, Argentina. <i>Parapharyngodon riojensis n.</i> sp. represents the ninth species of the genus from the Neotropical Realm and the first species to be described from Argentina. It can be distinguished from all species of Parapharyngodon on the basis of the morphology of the anterior cloacal lip, the location of the ovary, and geographical distribution. <i>Parapharyngodon riojensis n</i>. sp. is most similar to <i>P. senisfaciecaudus</i> in that the ovary does coil around the esophagus and the number and location of caudal papillae in the males are the same. These 2 species differ in that the eggs of <i>P. senisfaciecaudus</i> are slightly asymmetrical, with a smooth, thin shell, whereas the eggs of <i>P. riojensis</i> are oval, with a punctate thick shell. In addition, the cloacal lip of males of <i>P. senisfaciecaudus</i> is smooth, whereas the cloacal lip of males of <i>P. riojensis</i> is echinate. A key to the species of Parapharyngodon in the Neotropical Realm is provided.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Laboratory observations revealed that both <i>C. pipiens</i> and <i>C. quinquefasciatus</i> could harbour the parasitic <i>Hepatozoon</i>, while only <i>Cx. pipiens</i> succeeded to induce infection to the recipient lizard <i>Uromastyx microlepis</i>. A significant reduction in egg production together with a significant increase in the pre-oviposition period of <i>C. pipiens</i> was recorded. Incubation period and percentage of egg hatching showed no significant changes. Infection had no effect on the reproductive fitness of <i>C. quinquefasciatus</i>. Haematin excretion was normally distributed for all both species. No size difference was recorded between infected and uninfected ones. Infection did not affect longevity.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A lizard assemblage at Macraes Flat, New Zealand, comprising the common skinks <i>Oligosoma maccanni</i> and <i>Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma</i>, the endangered species <i>Oligosoma grande</i> and <i>Oligosoma otagense</i>, and the common gecko <i>Hoplodactylus maculatus</i>, was studied to determine the prevalence of ectoparasites and hemoparasites. The mites <i>Odontacarus lygosomae</i> and <i>Ophionyssus scincorum</i> infected all Oligosoma spp. only, and the mite <i>Neotrombicula naultini</i> infected only <i>H. maculatus</i>. The hemoparasite <i>Hepatozoon lygosomarum</i> infected all Oligosoma skinks, except <i>O. n. polychroma</i>. <i>Oligosoma otagense</i> had the highest infection levels of all parasites by several orders of magnitude. For all lizard species, there was no difference in mite prevalence between adult males and adult females, but juveniles were less often infected. For all skink species, there was a significant relationship between presence of the hemoparasite <i>He. lygosomarum</i> and infection intensity of the supposed vector, <i>O. scincorum</i>. It is unclear if patterns of parasite infection reflect species-specific susceptibility, host-parasite species-specific spatial ecology, or environmentally induced host physiological impairment. Considering the threatened nature of <i>O. otagense</i>, evidence of high parasitemia should stimulate further investigation.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The dynamics of a naturally endemic blood parasite (<i>Hepatozoon hinuliae</i>) were studied in a lizard (<i>Eulamprus quoyii</i>) host population, using 2 years of longitudinal data. We investigated how parasite abundance in the population varied over time, examined whether certain host sub-populations were more prone to infection, and compared parasite loads in relation to host reproductive behaviour. We recorded blood parasite infections of 331 individuals, obtained in 593 captures. Prevalence (the proportion of the host population infected) of blood parasites was high; approximately 66% of the lizard population was infected. Probability of infection increased with host age and size, but did not differ between the sexes. Within individuals, parasite load (the intensity of infection within individuals) did not vary over time, and was independent of host reproductive behaviour. Parasite load was significantly higher in males compared to females.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The fine structure of the different stages of the <i>Fallisia effusa</i> (Haemosporina: Garniidae), infecting the thrombocytes of the semi-aquatic Amazonian lizard <i>Neusticurus bicarinatus</i> (Reptilia: Teiidae) is described. Gametocytes, meronts, and merozoites of <i>Fallisia effusa</i> were found within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Multiple infections of micro- and macrogametocytes were observed. A circumferential coil of microtubules was seen in the cytoplasm of the infected host cell and this microtubule array was pronounced in cells harboring gametocytes. A deep invagination of the inner membrane complex of gametocytes may be involved in nutrition. The non-pigmented parasites underwent both merogony and gametogony in thrombocytes of the peripheral blood. No infection of the erythrocytes was observed. These observations confirm that <i>Fallisia effusa</i> displays characteristic features distinguishing it from other members of the Haemosporidian families, and that it has the ability to modulate microtubule assembly.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Little is known regarding the ultrastructure of the genus Fallisia (Apicomplexa: Haemosporina: Garniidae). This report describes the fine structure of some developmental stages of <i>Fallisia audaciosa</i> that infect neutrophils in the peripheral blood of the Amazonian lizard <i>Plica umbra </i>(Reptilia: Iguanidae). The parasites lie within a parasitophorous vacuole and exhibit the basic structures of members of the Apicomplexa, such as the pellicle and the cytostome. Invaginations of the inner membrane complex were seen in the gametocytes and may be concerned with nutrition. The meronts were irregularly shaped before division, a feature unusual among members of the Apicomplexa. The unusual presence of a parasitic protozoan within neutrophils, in some way interfering with or modulating the microbicidal activity of such cells, is discussed.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Although hematozoa have been described from many different host species, little is known about the infection and its relationship to the physiology of the host. We studied a hematozoan, regarded as a species of <i>Lainsonia Landau</i>, 1973 (Lankestereliidae), which infects the monocytes of the lizard <i>Ameiva ameiva</i>. The infected animals show a huge monocytosis and morphological changes in the monocytes. Ultrastructurally, the parasite has an apical complex, dense bodies, electron lucent structures, plasma membrane projections and folding which may be involved with nutrition. The parasite occupies a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) exhibiting high electron density at its membrane. Mitochondria and the Golgi complex of the monocytes were concentrated around the PV, and the cytoplasm was totally occupied by a vimentin type of intermediate filament radiating from (or to) the cytosolic surface of the PV. Vimentin was identified by diameter measurement, immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. These observations indicate that this infection alters the physiological state of the host and suggest that this parasite has the ability to modify monocyte vimentin assembly.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  <i>Rickettsia honei</i> is the aetiological agent of Flinders Island (Australia) spotted fever. The tick <i>Aponomma hydrosauri</i> is associated with reptiles and is the arthropod reservoir for this rickettsia on Flinders Island. The rickettsia appears to be maintained in the tick via vertical transmission. Of 46 ticks examined, 29 (63%) were positive for spotted fever group rickettsiae by detection of the citrate synthase gene by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). From the positive tick samples, seven were sequenced and found to be 100% homologous with <i>R. honei</i>. Of 17 reptiles examined, none had evidence of rickettsiae by PCR or culture of blood. <i>Courtesty of CAB Abstracts.</i><br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  <i>Acanthostomum macroclemidis</i> n. sp. is described from specimens found in the intestine of an alligator snapping turtle <i>Macroclemys temmincki</i> from southern Mississippi. The most important diagnostic features of the new species are the general shape and proportions of the body, the position of the pharynx (relative length of the prepharynx and esophagus), the egg size, the relative length and position of the vitelline fields, and the number, shape, and size of the circumoral spines. The new species has a very elongated body (length-width ratio, 8.9-13.0:1), 26 circumoral spines, which are almost oval in shape, a long prepharynx and a very short (shorter than the pharynx) esophagus, a seminal receptacle situated between the ovary and the anterior testis, a uterus not extending posterior to the anterior margin of the ovary, a long-stemmed and short-armed excretory vesicle, and 2 anal openings. Some features of the external morphology, such as the suckers, circumoral spines, sensory papillae, tegumental spines, and morphology of the posterior end, are examined using scanning electron microscopy. A diagnosis differentiating <i>A. macroclemidis</i> n. sp. from some other acanthostomine digeneans is provided. <i>Acanthostomum macroclemidis</i> n. sp. is the first digenean reported from an alligator snapping turtle and represents the northernmost record of an acanthostomine from turtles.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Myxomycetes are protists whose life cycle depends on aerially dispersed spores that germinate into motile myxamoebae, which then pair and fuse to form a larger, motile plasmodium. The plasmodium seeks out a suitable fruiting site (usually atop vegetative material or detritus) and transforms into fruiting bodies that release the spores. In this paper we report the first known instance of a myxomycete, in this case <i>Physarum pusillum</i>, sporulating on the body of a living animal, the cryptic lizard <i>Corytophanes cristatus</i>, which was collected in eastern Honduras in 2003.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  High levels of testosterone can benefit individual fitness, for example by increasing growth rate or ornament size, which may result in increased reproductive success. However, testosterone induces costs, such as a suppressed immune system, thereby generating trade-offs between growth or mate acquisition, and immunity. In birds and reptiles, females allocate steroids to their eggs, which may be a mechanism whereby females can influence the phenotype of their offspring. To our knowledge, only the benefits of early androgen exposure have been experimentally investigated to date. However, to understand this phenomenon, the costs also need to be evaluated. We manipulated testosterone levels in eggs of the viviparous common lizard and monitored growth, endurance and post-parturient responses to ectoparasites of the offspring. Testosterone-treated individuals had significantly higher growth rates than controls, but suffered a significant decrease in growth rate when exposed to ticks, whereas the corresponding difference for controls was non-significant. There was no difference in observed parasite load or leucocyte count between manipulated and control offspring. Thus, our results suggest that high testosterone levels during embryonic development have detrimental effects on immune function resulting in reduced growth rate, and that this must be taken into consideration when evaluating the potential adaptive value of maternal androgen allocation to eggs.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  Plasmodium-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers allowed detection of infections with very low-level parasitemia for 3 species of malaria parasites infecting Anolis lizards at 2 Caribbean sites, Puerto Rico and Saba, Netherlands Antilles. A verification study, using a single-tube nested PCR to eliminate contamination, showed that infections as low as 1 parasite per millions of erythrocytes could be detected by amplifying a 673 bp fragment of the cytochrome b gene. Very low-level parasitemia infections, subpatent under the microscope, were common in <i>A. sabanus</i> on Saba sites, with no significant seasonal difference (31% of infections appearing uninfected by microscopic examination in summer were found infected by PCR, 38% in winter). At the Puerto Rico site, the subpatent infections were also common in <i>A. gundlachi</i>, but were more prevalent in winter (53%) than in summer (17%). A similar high frequency of subpatent infections is known from studies on human and bird malaria, but a previous PCR-based study on a temperate lizard malaria system found few such low-level infections. Differences in the prevalence of subpatent infections by site and season suggest transmission biology may select for distinct life history strategies by the parasite.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  This paper determines the feeding performance of the larvae of two Neotropical soft tick species namely <i>Ornithodoros rostratus Aragao</i>, 1911 and <i>O. puertoricensis Fox</i>, 1947 on reptiles (Gekkonidae) using rabbits, mice and guinea pigs to provide comparisons with feeding features on mammals. <i>O. puertoricensis</i> produced a larval feeding rate of 63% on reptiles, while that of <i>O. rostratus</i> was only 20%. But the final success (attaching + feeding) was similar, 12.4% for <i>O. puertoricensis</i> and 10.4% for <i>O. rostratus</i>. The feeding time was also very different for both species. In <i>O. puertoricensis</i>, detachment begins at 16th day and lasts until day 27. In <i>O. rostratus</i> detachment begins at 1.5 h and lasts until day 10. These values of feeding on reptiles are different from those obtained on mammals (average 5.6 days for <i>O. puertoricensis</i> and 2.9 for <i>O. rostratus</i>).<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  The genetic diversity of <i>Cryptosporidium</i> in reptiles was analyzed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequence analysis of the small subunit rRNA gene. A total of 123 samples were analyzed, of which 48 snake samples, 24 lizard samples, and 3 tortoise samples were positive for <i>Cryptosporidium</i>. Nine different types of <i>Cryptosporidium</i> were found, including <i>Cryptosporidium serpentis</i>, <i>Cryptosporidium</i> desert monitor genotype, <i>Cryptosporidium muris</i>, <i>Cryptosporidium parvum bovine</i> and mouse genotypes, one <i>C. serpentis</i>-like parasite in a lizard, two new <i>Cryptosporidium</i> spp. in snakes, and one new <i>Cryptosporidium</i> sp. in tortoises. <i>C. serpentis</i> and the desert monitor genotype were the most common parasites and were found in both snakes and lizards, whereas the <i>C. muris</i> and <i>C. parvum</i> parasites detected were probably the result of ingestion of infected rodents. Sequence and biologic characterizations indicated that the desert monitor genotype was <i>Cryptosporidium saurophilum</i>. Two host-adapted <i>C. serpentis</i> genotypes were found in snakes and lizards.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  A second distinct array of spliced leader RNA genes has been found in several <i>Leishmania </i>species particular to lizards. This is the first report of two non-allelic arrays of spliced leader RNA genes within a species cell line. The arrays are identical to each other in their transcribed spliced leader RNA gene sequences, but variable in their non-transcribed spacer sequences. In the two arrays from <i>Leishmania tarentolae</i> UC strain the promoter regions are similar, but not identical, at positions shown previously to be critical for spliced leader RNA transcription. These arrays contain similar numbers of genes and are both transcribed in <i>L. tarentolae</i> in vitro transcription extract as well as in vivo. The -66/-58 regions of both genes, which contain an element of the spliced leader RNA gene promoter, bind proteins likely to be transcription factors in a specific manner. A survey of lizard<i> Leishmania</i> spp. revealed a second spliced leader RNA gene array in three of four species. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences with each other and with the spliced leader RNA gene sequences of non-lizard <i>Leishmania</i> spp. and their near-relatives showed that the lizard groups are more closely related to each other than to arrays from other <i>Leishmania</i> spp. As the transcripts of the two arrays are identical, they may co-exist to fulfil the substantial requirement for spliced leader RNA production; however, they have the potential for differential usage modulated by their distinct promoter elements. The presence of two distinct spliced leader RNA gene arrays within a single cell type may represent dissociated evolution of two redundant loci, or a previously unsuspected level of control in the post-transcriptional gene expression within some kinetoplastids.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>  We report 3 species of the digenean genus <i>Parallopharynx</i>, 1 previously undescribed, from the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste (ACG) in northwestern Costa Rica. <i>Parallopharynx gonzalezi</i>, which was originally described in <i>Basiliscus</i> sp. and <i>Ctenosoura similis</i> from central Costa Rica, inhabits <i>C. quinquecarinata</i>; <i>P. jonesi</i>, originally described in <i>Anolis lionotus</i> (syn. <i>Norops oxylophus</i>) from Nicaragua, inhabits <i>N. oxylophus, N. biporcatus</i>, and <i>Basiliscus basiliscus</i>; and the new species, which inhabits <i>B. basiliscus</i>. <i>Parallopharynx matternae n</i>. sp. differs from all other members of the genus by having a metraterm extending posteriad from the genital pore to the posterior margin of the ventral sucker, whereas in <i>P. arctus</i> and <i>P. gonzalezi</i>, the metraterm never surpasses the midlevel of the ventral sucker and in <i>P. jones</i>i it never passes the anterior margin of the ventral sucker, and by having an oral sucker that does not exceed 150 microm in diameter with a subsequent greater oral-ventral sucker width ratio ranging from 1:0.88-1.12 (averaging 1:1), whereas values range from 1:0.71-0.83 for P. gonzalezi and P. arctus, and from 1:0.59-0.68 for <i>P. jonesi</i>. Parallopharynx spp. possesses Y-shaped excretory vesicles with a long central stem and short arms bifurcating immediately posterior to the ovary; similar to those found in members of the Telorchiidae. Additional similarities in the relative positions of the gonads and the structure of the cirrus sac and metraterm indicate a close relationship between Parallopharynx and members of the Telorchiidae.<br>

Zhou, L., C. Yang, and L. Xiao (2003). <b>PCR-mediated recombination between <i>Cryptosporidium</i> spp. of lizards and snakes.</b> <i>Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology</i> 50(Suppl.): 563-565. ISSN: 1066-5234.<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  The presence or absence of genetic recombination has often been used as one of the criteria for <i>Cryptosporidium </i>species designation and population structure delineation. During a recent study of cryptosporidiosis in reptiles that were housed in the same room, 4 lizards were found to have concurrent infections of <i>C. serpentis</i> (a gastric parasite) and <i>C. saurophilum</i> (an intestinal parasite), and 6 snakes were concurrently infected with <i>C. serpentis, C. saurophilum</i> and a new <i>Cryptosporidium</i> as indicated by PCR-RFLP analysis of the SSU rRNA gene. DNA sequence analysis of cloned PCR products confirmed the diagnosis of mixed infections. Surprisingly, it appeared that 11 of the 22 clones (8 and 14 clones from a lizard and a snake, respectively) had chimeric sequences of two <i>Cryptosporidium</i> spp. BootScan analysis indicated the existence of recombinants among the cloned sequences and detection of the informative sites confirmed the BootScan results. Because the probability for genetic recombination between gastric and intestinal parasites is small, these hybrid sequences were likely results of PCR artifacts due to the presence of multiple templates. This was confirmed by PCR-sequencing analysis of single-copy templates using diluted DNA samples. Direct sequencing of 69 PCR products from 100- to 1,000-fold diluted DNAs from the same snake and lizard produced only sequences of <i>C. serpentis, C. saurophilum</i> and the unnamed <i>Cryptosporidium</i> sp. Thus, care should be taken to eliminate PCR artifacts when determining the presence of genetic recombination or interpreting results of population genetic studies.<br>
