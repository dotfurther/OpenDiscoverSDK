## Members
<table>
<tr>
<td>ParentChildWithPeriodSeparator</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Top-level parent documents have a unique control number (e.g., 00000121) and child documents have their attachment index appended to their parent's number with a period character ('.') separator, recursively. For example if a parent document with control number 00000121 has 2 child documents, the child document numbers will be 00000121.001 and 00000122.002, respectively. If child document "00000122.002" has 1 child document, then its control number will be "00000122.002.001".</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ParentChildWithDashSeparator</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Top-level parent documents have a unique control number (e.g., 00000121) and child documents have their attachment index appended to their parent's number with a dash character ('-') separator, recursively. For example if a parent document with control number 00000121 has 2 child documents, the child document numbers will be 00000121-001 and 00000122-002, respectively. If child document "00000122-002" has 1 child document, then its control number will be "00000122-002-001".</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ParentChildWithUnderscoreSeparator</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>Top-level parent documents have a unique control number (e.g., 00000121) and child documents have their attachment index appended to their parent's number with a underscore character ('_') separator, recursively. For example if a parent document with control number 00000121 has 2 child documents, the child document numbers will be 00000121_001 and 00000122_002, respectively. If child document "00000122_002" has 1 child document, then its control number will be "00000122_002_001".</td></tr>
