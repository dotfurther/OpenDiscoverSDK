        prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, including the costs of any expert witnesses, incurred at all 
        levels of proceedings.
        </p><p><strong>14. GOVERNING LAW.</strong> This Agreement shall be construed, governed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona, 
        without regard to any conflicts of laws rules. Any action related to or arising out of this Agreement will be filed only in the Arizona courts and Licensee 
        consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Phoenix, Arizona USA.
        </p><p><strong>15. SEVERABILITY.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid by any court of final jurisdiction, then it shall 
        be omitted, and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue to be binding and enforceable. In addition, the Court is hereby authorized to enforce any 
        provision of the Agreement that the Court otherwise deems unenforceable, to whatever lesser extent the Court deems reasonable and appropriate, rather than 
        invalidating the entire provision. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee expressly agrees that should Licensee be found to have breached 
        the Agreement, under no circumstances shall Licensee be entitled to any volume or other discount, or reduced licensing fee or royalty in the determination of 
        dotFurther's damages, or otherwise in the determination of any licensing fee or royalty owed to dotFurther.
