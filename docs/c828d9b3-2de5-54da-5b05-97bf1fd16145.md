**C#**
``` C#
[DataMemberAttribute]
public int FilterMinWordLength { get; set; }
```



#### Property Value
Int32

## Remarks

The purpose of this property is to reduce the amount of meaningless small length noise 'words' in the binary-to-text filtered text. The user is encouraged to experiment with different values of this property and find out what works best for their particular needs.

Any filtered words less than this value (length) are ignored by the binary-to-text filtering algorithm. For example, if this property value is set to 3 then the words "a", "at", and "to" could potentially be filtered out if word is not part of a larger contiguous region of filtered text, but the word "the" would not.

The default property value: 2

Valid property value range: 1 to 6
