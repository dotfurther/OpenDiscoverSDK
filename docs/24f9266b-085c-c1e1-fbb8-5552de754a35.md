[DataMemberAttribute]
public bool ExtractOfficeTrackedChanges { get; set; }
```



#### Property Value
Boolean

## Remarks

Certain document formats can track edits additions and deletions by author. Currently, only Microsoft Word supports revision history of changes. This property allows the user to configure whether or not these changes are appended as extracted text to the end of the document's extracted text.

Since insertion tracked changes will appear in document's extracted text, only tracked change deleted text is appended at the end of the document if this property is true. However, author and date for both insertions and deletions, if known, are appended.
