```



#### Property Value
Boolean

## Remarks

If this property value is true, then the method <a href="d6f285a5-6031-1242-10f2-3ce1f0c323d9">ExtractSolidBlockItems(GetItemStreamCallback, ItemExtractionFinishedCallback, String)</a> SHOULD be used to extract items, as it is much faster than calling method <a href="bfe60b4a-d6db-4da3-a602-be7d4d8d11b6">ExtractItem(Int32, Stream, String)</a> for each item, especially if there are many items in the archive.

Note: solid compressed blocks are not individually password protected. Solid compressed archives can either have encryption at: (1) archive level where central directory is encrypted and all blocks with the same password, or (2) where central directory is not encrypted but all blocks are encrypted with same password. For (1), it is not possible to get item information without a password.
