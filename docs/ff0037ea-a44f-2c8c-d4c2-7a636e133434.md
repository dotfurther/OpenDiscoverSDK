# ContentResult Enumeration


Content extraction result.



## Definition
**Namespace:** <a href="5601be11-3859-60ba-961e-4dc4e0cf2953">OpenDiscoverSDK.Interfaces</a>  
**Assembly:** OpenDiscoverSDK.Interfaces (in OpenDiscoverSDK.Interfaces.dll) Version: 2025.4.4.0 (2025.4.4)

**C#**
``` C#
[DataContractAttribute]
public enum ContentResult
```



## Remarks

The fields marked with "RESERVED" at the beginning of their summaries, integer values greater than 10000 (but less than 100000), are reserved for Open Discover Platform** namespace classes and for customers that build their own custom document processing engines upon Open Discover SDK.

The ContentResult enum members are backed by a unique, unchanging Int32 value. Int32 values between 1 and 100000 are reserved by SDK for future additions. If you wish to create your own Int32 based results to extend upon these values, then start with Int32 values greater than 100000.

** Due to its complexity, SDK built Open Discover Platform is only available to select customers.

<tr>
<td>MaxArchiveNestLevelError</td>
<td>19,200</td>
<td>Processing related exception - document is an archive whose nest level within other archive parent documents exceeds the user configurable maximum value. This error is to help protect against deeply nested archives within archives, and so on, that some forms of malicious 'ZIP-Bombs' (compression bomb) use to hide their true expansion size.</td></tr>
