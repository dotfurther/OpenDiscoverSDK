# ContentExtractionExample.csproj:

This example shows how to use the Open Discover SDK API to identify file formats and extract content from various
formats using the OpenDiscoverSDK.ContentExtractorFactory method and its returned interfaces.


## How to use this example:


## Note:
To ENABLE long file path support for Windows 10 and .NET 4.6.2, see this article:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Open Discover SDK is comprised of x64 assemblies due to unmanaged code dependencies

- Run examples in x64 build (either Debug or Release)
- To edit WinForm forms, set build platform to "Any CPU" and rebuild. This is required to edit WinForm windows. When done, set platform 
  back to x64 before executing in either Debug/Release mode.
- If you get initialization exceptions with error messages like "An attempt was made to load a program with
  an incorrect format" then you are mixing x86 and x64 platforms.
