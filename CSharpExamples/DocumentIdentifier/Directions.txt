Directions:
  1) Enter a directory in which you want to identify all files (includes all sub-directories). Try to keep the total number of files 
     to be identified under 500,000 because for this test application all file identification results are stored in memory.
  2) Press the 'Start' button to begin parallel file format identification of all files under the entered directory.
  3) Run test at least 2 times on same input directory to gauge true identification performance from that of your particular file system.
     On the second and following tests of same directory Windows will have cached the read files in the system cache so performance results 
	 will only reflect that of the SDK performance and not that of your file system's.

A graphical pie chart break down of the file format Id classifications and specific file formats identified will appear here after a 
successful file format identification test.

The 'Identification Details' tab page will have detailed file format information on each identified file (double-clicking on entry will 
open File Explorer to that file)

The 'All Supported Document File Formats' tab page details all Open Discover SDK supported file formats for identification (grouped by 
IdClassification)

**WARNING**
This example application will read 1000's of files a second and this may pique the interest of your anti-virus software. Your anti-virus 
software may use lots of CPU to closely monitor this example application because of this, or even kill this process. To monitor your anti-
virus, run this application with Windows Task Manager open and under the 'Details' sort by CPU. If your anti-virus software is interfering 
or killing this example application, add this application to your anti-virus' trusted applications (if possible).
