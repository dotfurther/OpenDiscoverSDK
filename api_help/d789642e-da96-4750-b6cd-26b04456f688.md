**2.2 LICENSE TYPE DESCRIPTIONS.**
<table><tr><td><strong>2.2.1. Standard Product License.</strong></td>
<td>A Standard Product license permits One (1) Developer to create an unlimited number of Derived Works using the Product at One (1) Physical Location within Licensee’s organization and Derived Work(s) can be Deployed to either One (1) Desktop or (1) Server. For example, if Licensee has licensed Four (4) Standard Product licenses for Four (4) Developers, Licensee can Deploy Derived Work(s) to either Four (4) Desktops or Four (4) Servers or a mixture of Desktop and Server Deployments that amount to Four (4) total Deployments at the Physical Location. If Licensee wishes to Deploy Derived Works to more Desktop or Servers at Physical Location than the number of licensed Standard Product License permits, then the Licensee must purchase a Standard Product Distribution License per each additional Desktop or Server Deployment</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>2.2.2. Service Product License.</strong></td>

<td>A Standard Product Distribution license is required for every additional Desktop or Server Deployments, outside of the One (1) Physical Location Deployment granted by One (1) Standard Product License, for any Derived Works that qualify as Standard Product. If the Standard Product does not qualify as a Service Product, this license type allows Deployment of Derived Works that qualify as a Standard Product to third parties, public facing web sites/applications, extranets, multi-site intranets, or SaaS usage scenarios. A Derived Work that is an SDK is not qualified for either a Service Product Distribution License nor a Standard Product Distribution License.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>2.2.4. Service Product Distribution License.</strong></td>
<td>A Service Product Distribution license is required for each Desktop or Server Deployment of Derived Works that qualify as a Service Product. This license type allows Deployment of Derived Works that qualify as a Service Product to third parties, public facing web sites/applications, extranets, multi-site intranets, or SaaS usage scenarios. A Derived Work that is an SDK is not qualified for either a Service Product Distribution License nor a Standard Product Distribution License.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>2.2.5. Evaluation Product License.</strong></td>
<td>dotFurther grants the individual or entity contracting under this agreement (Licensee) a limited, nontransferable, nonexclusive and non-assignable license to use the Evaluation Version of the Product on a single Desktop for evaluation of fitness only and not for ANY commercial purpose; Licensee MAY NOT use the Product to produce any Derived Works with exception of Works produced exclusively for the purpose of Product evaluation of fitness. The Product is explicitly not to be used on a Physical Location-wide or on a public or private network basis, via a Server or other networked connection. If Licensee uses the product in any Derived Works, Licensee must purchase the applicable license or Licensee may be sued for collection and punitive damages. If Licensee does not agree to these terms, then Licensee must not evaluate the Product and remove it from Licensee’s computer immediately.
