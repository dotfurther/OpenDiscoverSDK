#### Property Value
Boolean

## Remarks

This property is associated with email content hashing (see properties <a href="a852bcf7-e763-6d05-21d0-198c8c9e1fe3">MD5ContentHash</a> and <a href="66becb90-e903-e12d-cf4d-2a8aa6b65937">SHA1ContentHash</a>). If property <a href="d34afc18-5918-ccab-8fc3-99f3100e4842">HashingType</a> is not set to <a href="ac4684ec-55e3-962b-0664-643a11484fb1">BinaryAndContentHash</a> then this property value is ignored.

The 'Bcc' recipients do not appear to all recipients of a sent email. Including 'Bcc' recipients in email hashes could lead to a sender's email recipient hash not matching up with that of the receivers' copy. Thus, by default, the value of this property is false, i.e., do NOT include Bcc recipients in the email object's recipient hash calculation.

The recipient hash is one of several hashes that are combined and hashed together to make up an email's overall content hash.

Default property value: false
